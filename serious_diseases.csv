disease,common_symptom,Description
Vulvar Pemphigus,"Blisters, pain, anorexia, mucosal damage, hypersensitivity, and ulcers","A vulvar disease is a particular abnormal, pathological condition that affects part or all of the vulva. Several pathologies are defined. Some can be prevented by vulvovaginal health maintenance.


== Vulvar cancer ==

Vulvar cancer accounts for about 5% of all gynecological cancers and typically affects women in later life. Five-year survival rates in the United States are around 70%."
Desmoplastic Fibroma,"Protrusion of bone surfaces, bone pain, swelling and pain in the long bones","In medicine, a desmoplastic fibroma is a low-grade malignant, locally aggressive, fibrous and rare tumor of the bone, affecting children and young adults, potentially resulting in cortical bone destruction. It usually affects craniofacial bones, mandible most frequently, long bones (metaphyseal femur, tibia, humerus). The World Health Organization, 2020, reclassified these tumors as specific benign tumors in the category of fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors.
Although it does not tend to metastatize, it has a high local recurrence and infiltrative growth. Treatment consists in wide local excision to prevent otherwise frequent recurrences."
Pediatric renovascular hypertension,"Headache, dizziness, restlessness, vomiting, heart failure, renal failure, urea clearance disorder, nephrotic syndrome, increased diastolic pressure, fever, outpatient hypertension, edema","Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms itself. It is, however, a major risk factor for stroke, coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, vision loss, chronic kidney disease, and dementia. Hypertension is a major cause of premature death worldwide.
High blood pressure is classified as primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension."
Neonatal Brain Edema,"Irritability, somnolence, coma","Cerebral edema is excess accumulation of fluid (edema) in the intracellular or extracellular spaces of the brain. This typically causes impaired nerve function, increased pressure within the skull, and can eventually lead to direct compression of brain tissue and blood vessels. Symptoms vary based on the location and extent of edema and generally include headaches, nausea, vomiting, seizures, drowsiness, visual disturbances, dizziness, and in severe cases, death.
Cerebral edema is commonly seen in a variety of brain injuries including ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, subdural, epidural, or intracerebral hematoma, hydrocephalus, brain cancer, brain infections, low blood sodium levels, high altitude, and acute liver failure. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and physical examination findings and confirmed by serial neuroimaging (computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging)."
Multiple Myeloma-Associated Kidney Disease,"Bone pain, pathological fractures, anemia, tendency to bleed, recurrent infections","Multiple myeloma (MM), also known as plasma cell myeloma and simply myeloma, is a cancer of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell that normally produces antibodies. Often, no symptoms are noticed initially. As it progresses, bone pain, anemia, renal insufficiency, and infections may occur. Complications may include hypercalcemia and amyloidosis.
The cause of multiple myeloma is unknown."
Pancreatic Polypeptide Tumor (PPoma),"Abdominal pain, weight loss, diarrhea, hepatomegaly, abdominal mass, skin rash, ascites","Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PanNETs, PETs, or PNETs), often referred to as ""islet cell tumours"", or ""pancreatic endocrine tumours"" are neuroendocrine neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous system within the pancreas.
PanNETs are a type of neuroendocrine tumor, representing about one-third of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). Many PanNETs are benign, while some are malignant. Aggressive PanNET tumors have traditionally been termed ""islet cell carcinoma"".
PanNETs are quite distinct from the usual form of pancreatic cancer, the majority of which are adenocarcinomas, which arise in the exocrine pancreas."
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in the Elderly,"Wasting, fatigue, night sweats, loss of appetite, low-grade fever, fever, anemia, persistent febrile","Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. In CLL, the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell. In patients with CLL, B cell lymphocytes can begin to collect in their blood, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. These cells do not function well and crowd out healthy blood cells. CLL is divided into two main types:

Slow-growing CLL (indolent CLL)
Fast-growing CLL
Many people do not have any symptoms when they are first diagnosed."
Endocrine Hypertension,"Dizziness, nausea, blurred vision, tinnitus","Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms itself. It is, however, a major risk factor for stroke, coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, vision loss, chronic kidney disease, and dementia. Hypertension is a major cause of premature death worldwide.
High blood pressure is classified as primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension."
Upper Airway Obstruction,"Irritative dry cough, wheezing, difficulty breathing, expression of severe discomfort, scratching the throat, inspiratory stridor","Airway obstruction is a blockage of respiration in the airway that hinders the free flow of air. Airway obstructions can occur either in the upper airway or lower airway. The upper airway consists of the nose, throat, and larynx. The lower airway comprises the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles.
Airway obstruction is a life-threatening condition and requires urgent attention."
Flavobacterium Meningosepticum Pneumonia,"Fever, vomiting, signs of meningeal irritation, syncope, cough, expectoration, pleural effusion, hypocalcemia, chest pain, interlobar fissures often presenting as arc-shaped drooping","Elizabethkingia meningoseptica is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium widely distributed in nature (e.g. fresh water, salt water, or soil). It may be normally present in fish and frogs; it may be isolated from chronic infectious states, as in the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients. In 1959,  American bacteriologist Elizabeth O. King (who isolated Kingella kingae in 1960) was studying unclassified bacteria associated with pediatric meningitis at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, when she isolated an organism (CDC group IIa) that she named Flavobacterium meningosepticum (Flavobacterium means ""the yellow bacillus"" in Latin; meningosepticum likewise means ""associated with meningitis and sepsis""). In 1994, it was reclassified in the genus Chryseobacterium and renamed Chryseobacterium meningosepticum(chryseos = ""golden"" in Greek, so Chryseobacterium means a golden/yellow rod similar to Flavobacterium)."
Congenital Retrosternal Diaphragmatic Hernia,"Sternal cleft, tenderness in the intercostal spaces, sunken lower sternum and ribcage upon inhalation, pectus carinatum when inhaling, abnormal thorax, intercostal neuralgia, pneumothorax, paradoxical abdominal respiration, chest deformity, absence of the central line of the upper abdominal wall, and elevated diaphragm","Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a birth defect of the diaphragm.  The most common type of CDH is a Bochdalek hernia;  other types include Morgagni hernia, diaphragm eventration and central tendon defects of the diaphragm.  Malformation of the diaphragm allows the abdominal organs to push into the chest cavity, hindering proper lung formation.
CDH is a life-threatening pathology in infants and a major cause of death due to two complications: pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension.  Experts disagree on the relative importance of these two conditions, with some focusing on hypoplasia, others on hypertension."
Hypernatremia,"Fatigue, headache, irritability, tremors, convulsions, difficulty breathing, cough","Hyponatremia or hyponatraemia is a low concentration of sodium in the blood. It is generally defined as a sodium concentration of less than 135 mmol/L (135 mEq/L), with severe hyponatremia being below 120 mEq/L. Symptoms can be absent, mild or severe. Mild symptoms include a decreased ability to think, headaches, nausea, and poor balance. Severe symptoms include confusion, seizures, and coma; death can ensue.
The causes of hyponatremia are typically classified by a person's body fluid status into low volume, normal volume, or high volume."
Mycotoxicosis,"Convulsions, low-grade fever, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloating, enlarged liver, jaundice","A mycotoxin (from the Greek  mykes, ""fungus"" and  toxikos, ""poisonous"") is a toxic secondary metabolite produced by fungi and is capable of causing disease and death in both humans and other animals. The term 'mycotoxin' is usually reserved for the toxic chemical products produced by fungi that readily colonize crops.
Examples of mycotoxins causing human and animal illness include aflatoxin, citrinin, fumonisins, ochratoxin A, patulin, trichothecenes, zearalenone, and ergot alkaloids such as ergotamine.
One mold species may produce many different mycotoxins, and several species may produce the same mycotoxin.


== Production ==
Most fungi are aerobic (use oxygen) and are found almost everywhere in extremely small quantities due to the diminutive size of their spores."
Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome,"Alcohol-induced tremors, nausea and vomiting, facial flushing, anorexia, withdrawal seizures, dipsomania hallucinatory psychosis, tremors, delirium, convulsions, consciousness disorders, conjunctival congestion, tachycardia","Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is a set of symptoms that can occur following a reduction in or cessation of alcohol use after a period of excessive use. Symptoms typically include anxiety, shakiness, sweating, vomiting, fast heart rate, and a mild fever. More severe symptoms may include seizures, and delirium tremens (DTs); which can be fatal in untreated patients. Symptoms start at around 6 hours after the last drink. Peak incidence of seizures occurs at 24 to 36 hours and peak incidence of delirium tremens is at 48 to 72 hours."
Elderly Acute Appendicitis,"Lower right abdominal colic, nausea and vomiting, fever with chills, tenderness in the lower right abdomen with rebound pain","Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. Symptoms commonly include right lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever and decreased appetite. However, approximately 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms. Severe complications of a ruptured appendix include widespread, painful inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall and sepsis.
Appendicitis is primarily caused by a blockage of the hollow portion in the appendix."
Neonatal Hemolytic Disease,"General edema in neonates, pallor, petechiae, pleural effusion, increased limb muscle tone, convulsions, opisthotonos, respiratory failure, hemolytic phenomena, edema, jaundice, hepatomegaly","Hemolytic disease of the newborn, also known as hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, HDN, HDFN, or erythroblastosis fetalis, is an alloimmune condition that develops in a fetus at or around birth, when the IgG molecules (one of the five main types of antibodies) produced by the mother pass through the placenta. Among these antibodies are some which attack antigens on the red blood cells in the fetal circulation, breaking down and destroying the cells. The fetus can develop reticulocytosis and anemia. The intensity of this fetal disease ranges from mild to very severe, and fetal death from heart failure (hydrops fetalis) can occur. When the disease is moderate or severe, many erythroblasts (immature red blood cells) are present in the fetal blood, earning these forms of the disease the name erythroblastosis fetalis (British English: erythroblastosis foetalis
HDFN represents a breach of immune privilege for the fetus or some other form of impairment of the immune tolerance in pregnancy."
Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) Lymphoma,"Insidious onset of upper abdominal pain, bloating, indigestion, nausea and vomiting, acid reflux, and weight loss","MALT lymphoma (also called MALToma) is a form of lymphoma involving the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), frequently of the stomach, but virtually any mucosal site can be affected. It is a cancer originating from B cells in the marginal zone of the MALT.


== Diagnosis and staging ==
MALT lymphoma is often a multifocal disease in the organ of origin and is frequently macroscopically indistinguishable from other disease processes in the GI tract. Endoscopy is key to diagnosing MALT lymphoma, with multiple biopsies of the visible lesions required, as well as samples of macroscopically normal tissue, termed gastric mapping. Histologically, there is expansion of the marginal zone compartment with development of sheets of neoplastic small lymphoid cells. The morphology of the neoplastic cells is variable with small mature lymphocytes, cells resembling centrocytes (centrocyte like cells), or marginal zone/monocytoid B cells."
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS),Unexplained death,"Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), sometimes known as cot death or crib death, is the sudden unexplained death of a child of less than one year of age. Diagnosis requires that the death remain unexplained even after a thorough autopsy and detailed death scene investigation. SIDS usually occurs during sleep. Typically death occurs between the hours of midnight and 9:00 a.m.  There is usually no noise or evidence of struggle."
Anal Papillitis,"Anal discomfort, hidden anal pain, anal itching, prone to dampness","Oral leukoplakia is a potentially malignant disorder affecting the oral mucosa. It is defined as ""essentially an oral mucosal white/gray lesion that cannot be considered as any other definable lesion."" Oral leukoplakia is a gray patch or plaque that develops in the oral cavity and is strongly associated with smoking. Leukoplakia is a firmly attached white patch on a mucous membrane which is associated with increased risk of cancer. The edges of the lesion are typically abrupt and the lesion changes with time. Advanced forms may develop red patches."
Paget's Disease of the Breast,"Itching or intense itching of the nipple, burning sensation, followed by redness of the nipple and areola skin, presence of yellowish-brown scaly crusts, revealing slight skin erosion under the crust, presenting as chronic eczematous changes.","Paget's disease of the breast (also known as mammary Paget's disease) is a rare skin change at the nipple nearly always associated with underlying breast cancer. Paget's disease of the breast was first described by Sir James Paget in 1874. The condition is an uncommon disease accounting for 1 to 4% of all breast cancers cases. 92% to 100% of patients with Paget's disease of the breast have an underlying breast cancer.
The condition in itself often appears innocuous, limited to a surface appearance and it is sometimes dismissed, although it is actually indicative of underlying breast cancer."
Metabolic Acidosis in the Elderly,"Deepened respiration, fatigue, dizziness, palpitations","Hypovolemic shock is a form of shock caused by severe hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume or extracellular fluid in the body). It can be caused by severe dehydration or blood loss. Hypovolemic shock is a medical emergency; if left untreated, the insufficient blood flow can cause damage to organs, leading to multiple organ failure.
In treating hypovolemic shock, it is important to determine the cause of the underlying hypovolemia, which may be the result of bleeding or other fluid losses. To minimize ischemic damage to tissues, treatment involves quickly replacing lost blood or fluids, with consideration of both rate and the type of fluids used."
Geriatric Venous Thrombosis,"Venous thrombosis, heat pain, local venous tenderness, gastrocnemius muscle tenderness, pain, calf swelling, calf edema, referred pain, lower limb swelling and fatigue, pallid skin","Intestinal ischemia is a medical condition in which injury to the large or small intestine occurs due to not enough blood supply. It can come on suddenly, known as acute intestinal ischemia, or gradually, known as chronic intestinal ischemia. The acute form of the disease often presents with sudden severe abdominal pain and is associated with a high risk of death. The chronic form typically presents more gradually with abdominal pain after eating, unintentional weight loss, vomiting, and fear of eating.
Risk factors for acute intestinal ischemia include atrial fibrillation, heart failure, chronic kidney failure, being prone to forming blood clots, and previous myocardial infarction."
Yersinia Enterocolitica and Yersinia Pseudotuberculosis Pneumonia,"Persistent fever, coughing, shortness of breath, and abdominal ascites","Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis; formerly Pasteurella pestis) is a gram-negative, non-motile, coccobacillus bacterium without spores. It is related to pathogens Yersinia enterocolitica, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, from which it evolved. Yersinia pestis is responsible for the disease plague, which caused the Plague of Justinian and the Black Death, one of the deadliest pandemics in recorded history. Plague takes three main forms: pneumonic, septicemic, and bubonic. Y. pestis is a facultative anaerobic parasitic bacterium that can infect humans primarily via its host the Oriental rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis), but also through aerosols and airborne droplets for its pneumonic form."
Pediatric Craniofacial Deformity Syndrome,"Craniofacial bone deformity, triangular head deformity, developmental disorders of the brain, hook nose, sparse hair, microcephaly, iris defects, aphakia with blue sclera and microphthalmos","Pfeiffer syndrome is a rare genetic disorder, characterized by the premature fusion of certain bones of the skull (craniosynostosis), which affects the shape of the head and face. The syndrome includes abnormalities of the hands and feet, such as wide and deviated thumbs and big toes.
Pfeiffer syndrome is caused by mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptors FGFR1 and FGFR2. The syndrome is grouped into three types: type 1 (classic Pfeiffer syndrome) is milder and caused by mutations in either gene; types 2 and 3 are more severe, often leading to death in infancy, caused by mutations in FGFR2.
There is no cure for the syndrome."
Pleomorphic Adenoma of the Salivary Gland,"Foreign body sensation in the throat, painless mass in the parotid gland, facial nerve paralysis, enlargement of the submandibular gland","Pleomorphic adenoma (or benign mixed tumor) is a common benign salivary gland neoplasm characterised by neoplastic proliferation of epithelial (ductal) cells along with myoepithelial components, having a malignant potentiality. It is the most common type of salivary gland tumor and the most common tumor of the parotid gland. It derives its name from the architectural Pleomorphism (variable appearance) seen by light microscopy. It is also known as ""Mixed tumor, salivary gland type"", which refers to its dual origin from epithelial and myoepithelial elements as opposed to its pleomorphic appearance.


== Clinical presentation ==
The tumor is usually solitary and presents as a slow growing, painless, firm single nodular mass."
Drug-induced Respiratory Failure,"Dyspnea, coma, abnormal breathing, restlessness, respiratory alkalosis, slow and regular breathing rate, sudden cardiac dysfunction, pleural effusion due to lung cancer, exertional dyspnea, abnormal breath sounds, metabolic acidosis, sighing respiration","Respiratory failure results from inadequate gas exchange by the respiratory system, meaning that the arterial oxygen, carbon dioxide, or both cannot be kept at normal levels. A drop in the oxygen carried in the blood is known as hypoxemia; a rise in arterial carbon dioxide levels is called hypercapnia. Respiratory failure is classified as either Type 1 or Type 2, based on whether there is a high carbon dioxide level, and can be acute or chronic. In clinical trials, the definition of respiratory failure usually includes increased respiratory rate, abnormal blood gases (hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or both), and evidence of increased work of breathing. Respiratory failure causes an altered state of consciousness due to ischemia in the brain."
Pulmonary Malaria,"Fever, chills, productive cough, coughing, diffuse or scattered reversible wheezing sounds in both lungs, intermittent fever, detection of Plasmodium in blood bone marrow or sputum smears, increased pulmonary water content, chest pain, cyclical chills and fever with sweating as symptoms recede, alternation of cold and heat, ascites","Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects vertebrates and Anopheles mosquitoes. Human malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, fatigue, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases, it can cause jaundice, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin 10 to 15 days after being bitten by an infected Anopheles mosquito. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later."
Chronic Appendicitis,"Lower right abdominal pain, tenderness, low fever","Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. Symptoms commonly include right lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever and decreased appetite. However, approximately 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms. Severe complications of a ruptured appendix include widespread, painful inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall and sepsis.
Appendicitis is primarily caused by a blockage of the hollow portion in the appendix."
Relapsing Polychondritis,"Red, swollen, hot, and painful auricle; sudden collapse of the nasal bridge; frequent nasal congestion, nasal discharge, and nasal chondritis; migratory, asymmetrical, non-deforming arthritis.","Relapsing polychondritis is a systemic disease characterized by repeated episodes of inflammation and in some cases deterioration of cartilage. The disease can be life-threatening if the respiratory tract, heart valves, or blood vessels are affected. The exact mechanism is poorly understood.
The diagnosis is reached on the basis of the symptoms and supported by investigations such as blood tests and sometimes other investigations. Treatment may involve symptomatic treatment with painkillers or anti-inflammatory medications, and more severe cases may require suppression of the immune system."
Osteogenesis Imperfecta,"Spontaneous fractures, blue sclerae, joint hypermobility, dwarfism, poor dental development","Osteogenesis imperfecta (IPA: ; OI), colloquially known as brittle bone disease, is a group of genetic disorders that all result in bones that break easily.:85 The range of symptomson the skeleton as well as on the body's other organsmay be mild to severe.:1512 Symptoms found in various types of OI include whites of the eye (sclerae) that are blue instead, short stature, loose joints, hearing loss, breathing problems and problems with the teeth (dentinogenesis imperfecta). Potentially life-threatening complications, all of which become more common in more severe OI, include: tearing (dissection) of the major arteries, such as the aorta;:333 pulmonary valve insufficiency secondary to distortion of the ribcage;:335341 and basilar invagination.:106107
The underlying mechanism is usually a problem with connective tissue due to a lack of, or poorly formed, type I collagen.:1513 In more than 90% of cases, OI occurs due to mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes. These mutations may be hereditary in an autosomal dominant manner but may also occur spontaneously (de novo). There are four clinically defined types: type I, the least severe; type IV, moderately severe; type III, severe and progressively deforming; and type II, perinatally lethal. As of September 2021, 19 different genes are known to cause the 21 documented genetically defined types of OI, many of which are extremely rare and have only been documented in a few individuals."
Uveal Malignant Melanoma,"Distorted vision, minification of objects, visual field defects, retinal detachment, visual impairment, pigmentation and depigmentation, eye pain, central scotoma, and changes in refractive status, proptosis","Uveal melanoma is a type of eye cancer in the uvea of the eye. It is traditionally classed as originating in the iris, choroid, and ciliary body, but can also be divided into class I (low metastatic risk) and class II (high metastatic risk). Symptoms include blurred vision, loss of vision, and photopsia, but there may be no symptoms.
Tumors arise from the pigment cells that reside within the uvea and give color to the eye. These melanocytes are distinct from the retinal pigment epithelium cells underlying the retina that do not form melanomas."
Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria in Children,"Chills, fever, headache, abdominal pain, back pain","Paroxysmal attacks or paroxysms are a sudden recurrence or intensification of symptoms, such as a spasm or seizure. These short, frequent symptoms can be observed in various clinical conditions. They are usually associated with multiple sclerosis or pertussis, but they may also be observed in other disorders such as encephalitis, head trauma, stroke, autism, asthma, trigeminal neuralgia, breath-holding spells, epilepsy, malaria, tabes dorsalis, Behet's disease, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). It has also been noted as a symptom of gratification disorder in children.
The word paroxysm means 'sudden attack, outburst' and comes from Greek   (paroxusms) 'irritation, exasperation'."
Hepatoblastoma,"Abnormal appetite, upper abdominal mass, anorexia, abdominal distension, weight loss, precocious puberty, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, pale complexion","Hepatoblastoma is a malignant liver cancer occurring in infants and children and composed of tissue resembling fetal liver cells, mature liver cells, or bile duct cells. They usually present with an abdominal mass.  The disease is most commonly diagnosed during a child's first three years of life. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels are commonly elevated, but when AFP is not elevated at diagnosis the prognosis is poor.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Patients are usually asymptomatic at diagnosis."
Peripheral Nervous System Tumors,"Tumors vary in size, are round or nodular, solid in texture with a complete capsule","A nervous system tumor is a tumor that arises within the nervous system, either the central nervous system (CNS) or the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Nervous system primary tumors include various types of brain tumor and spinal tumors, such as gliomas, and meningiomas (of the CNS), and schwannomas (of the PNS) and can be either benign or malignant. 
There are over 120 types of brain and spinal cord tumors. In the CNS a tumor may be a malignant secondary tumor having metastasised (spread from a primary site in the body). Secondary tumors are more common in adults."
Community-Acquired Pneumonia,"Nasal congestion, sore throat, headache, fever, jaundice, foreign body sensation in throat, hemoptysis, abnormal breathing, myalgia, chest pain, lung infection","Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) refers to pneumonia (any of several lung diseases) contracted by a person outside of the healthcare system. In contrast, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is seen in patients who have recently visited a hospital or who live in long-term care facilities. CAP is common, affecting people of all ages, and its symptoms occur as a result of oxygen-absorbing areas of the lung (alveoli) filling with fluid. This inhibits lung function, causing dyspnea, fever, chest pains and cough.
CAP, the most common type of pneumonia, is a leading cause of illness and death worldwide."
Renal Magnesium Wasting,"Muscle contractions, limb spasms, carpopedal spasms, convulsions, unsteady gait, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, weakness, dizziness, and hallucinations","Magnesium deficiency is an electrolyte disturbance in which there is a low level of magnesium in the body. Symptoms include tremor, poor coordination, muscle spasms, loss of appetite, personality changes, and nystagmus. Complications may include seizures or cardiac arrest such as from torsade de pointes. Those with low magnesium often have low potassium.
Causes include low dietary intake, alcoholism, diarrhea, increased urinary loss, and poor absorption from the intestines."
Microscopic Polyangiitis,"Skin purpura, papules, livedo reticularis, hematuria with proteinuria, fever with arthralgia, heart failure, maculopapular rash, vasculitis, hypersensitivity angiitis, arrhythmias, systemic vasculitis","Microscopic polyangiitis is an autoimmune disease characterized by a systemic, pauci-immune, necrotizing, small-vessel vasculitis without clinical or pathological evidence of granulomatous inflammation.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Clinical features may include constitutional symptoms like fever, arthralgia, myalgia, loss of appetite, weight loss and fatigue. A variety of organs can be affected, which causes a wide range of symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis (coughing up of blood), symptoms of kidney failure, skin manifestations (palpable purpura and livedo racemosa), seizures or peripheral neuropathy, abdominal pain 
The kidneys are affected in up to 80% of cases with signs of blood and protein in the urine and the injury can lead to either rapidly or slowly progressive kidney failure. The lungs are affected in 20-50% of cases with findings of pulmonary hemorrhage, or chronic pulmonary fibrosis leading to respiratory failure.


== Causes ==
While the mechanism of the disease has yet to be fully elucidated, the leading hypothesis is that AAV (ANCA Associated Vasculitis) develops in patients with a genetic predisposition when an unknown cause triggers the production of p-ANCA. These antibodies will circulate at low levels until an environmental triggersuch as infection, malignancy, or drug therapy, causes the upregulation of neutrophils."
Edema,"Capillary rupture, skin congestion, pain","Edema (American English), also spelled oedema (British English), and also known as fluid retention, swelling, dropsy and hydropsy, is the build-up of fluid in the body's tissue. Most commonly, the legs or arms are affected. Symptoms may include skin that feels tight, the area feeling heavy, and joint stiffness. Other symptoms depend on the underlying cause.
Causes may include venous insufficiency, heart failure, kidney problems, low protein levels, liver problems, deep vein thrombosis, infections, kwashiorkor, angioedema, certain medications, and lymphedema."
Sepsis-induced Kidney Injury,"High fever with chills, chills, headache, abdominal distension, joint pain, general malaise, rash","Acute kidney injury (AKI), previously called acute renal failure (ARF), is a sudden decrease in kidney function that develops within seven days, as shown by an increase in serum creatinine or a decrease in urine output, or both.
Causes of AKI are classified as either prerenal (due to decreased blood flow to the kidney), intrinsic renal (due to damage to the kidney itself), or postrenal (due to blockage of urine flow). Prerenal causes of AKI include sepsis, dehydration, excessive blood loss, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, cirrhosis, and certain medications like ACE inhibitors or NSAIDs. Intrinsic renal causes of AKI include glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, certain antibiotics, and chemotherapeutic agents. Postrenal causes of AKI include kidney stones, bladder cancer, neurogenic bladder, enlargement of the prostate, narrowing of the urethra, and certain medications like anticholinergics."
Stable Angina,"Precordial pain, fatigue, shortness of breath","Angina, also known as angina pectoris, is chest pain or pressure, usually caused by insufficient blood flow to the heart muscle (myocardium). It is most commonly a symptom of coronary artery disease.
Angina is typically the result of partial obstruction or spasm of the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. The main mechanism of coronary artery obstruction is atherosclerosis as part of coronary artery disease. Other causes of angina include abnormal heart rhythms, heart failure and, less commonly, anemia."
Pediatric Familial Hypophosphatemic Rickets,"""O"" shaped legs, ""X"" shaped legs, bone pain, dental pain, beading of the ribs, spinal and limb deformities, joint pain","Hypophosphatemia is an electrolyte disorder in which there is a low level of phosphate in the blood. Symptoms may include weakness, trouble breathing, and loss of appetite. Complications may include seizures, coma, rhabdomyolysis, or softening of the bones.
Nutritional phosphate deficiency is exceedingly rare as phosphate is abundant in most types of foods and is readily passively absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; hypophosphatemia is thus typically a result of diseases or an adverse effect of medical treatments. Causes include alcohol use disorder, refeeding in those with malnutrition, recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis, burns, hyperventilation, and certain medications."
Strangulation,"Asphyxiation, incontinence of urine and feces","Strangling or strangulation is compression of the neck that may lead to unconsciousness or death by causing an increasingly hypoxic state in the brain by restricting the flow of oxygen through the trachea. Fatal strangulation typically occurs in cases of violence, accidents, and is one of two main ways that hanging causes death (alongside breaking the victim's neck).
Strangling does not have to be fatal; limited or interrupted strangling is practised in erotic asphyxia, in the choking game, and is an important technique in many combat sports and self-defense systems. Strangling can be divided into three general types according to the mechanism used:

Hanging  Suspension from a cord wound around the neck
Ligature strangulation  Strangulation without suspension using some form of cord-like object (ligature) called a garrote
Manual strangulation  Strangulation using the fingers, hands, or other extremity


== General ==

Strangling involves one or several mechanisms that interfere with the normal flow of oxygen into the brain:

Compression of the carotid arteries or jugular veinscausing cerebral ischemia.
Compression of the laryngopharynx, larynx, or tracheacausing asphyxia."
Bone Marrow Transplantation,"Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hair loss, fatigue, poor appetite","Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) is the transplantation of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells, usually derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood, in order to replicate inside a patient and produce additional normal blood cells. HSCT may be autologous (the patient's own stem cells are used),  syngeneic (stem cells from an identical twin), or allogeneic (stem cells from a donor).
It is most often performed for patients with certain cancers of the blood or bone marrow, such as multiple myeloma, leukemia, some types of lymphoma and immune deficiencies. In these cases, the recipient's immune system is usually suppressed with radiation or chemotherapy before the transplantation. Infection and graft-versus-host disease are major complications of allogeneic HSCT.
HSCT remains a dangerous procedure with many possible complications; it is reserved for patients with life-threatening diseases."
Carbon Tetrachloride Poisoning,"Nausea and vomiting, confusion, hepatomegaly (enlarged liver), hepatic pain, headache, ascites, diarrhea, acute renal failure, abdominal pain","Carbon tetrachloride, also known by many other names (such as carbon tet for short and tetrachloromethane, also recognised by the IUPAC), is a chemical compound with the chemical formula CCl4. It is a non-flammable, dense, colourless liquid with a ""sweet"" chloroform-like odour that can be detected at low levels. It was formerly widely used in fire extinguishers, as a precursor to refrigerants, an anthelmintic and a cleaning agent, but has since been phased out because of environmental and safety concerns. Exposure to high concentrations of carbon tetrachloride can affect the central nervous system and degenerate the liver and kidneys. Prolonged exposure can be fatal."
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) in Children,"Low-grade fever, sweating, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, sternal tenderness, dizziness, confusion, tendency to bleed","Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), also known as chronic myeloid leukemia, is a cancer of the white blood cells. It is a form of leukemia characterized by the increased and unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of these cells in the blood. CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) and their precursors is found; characteristic increase in basophils is clinically relevant. It is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome.
CML is largely treated with targeted drugs called tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which have led to dramatically improved long-term survival rates since 2001."
Pancreatic Cystadenocarcinoma,"Abdominal pain with jaundice, abdominal pain, abdominal mass, loss of appetite, nausea, indigestion, weight loss","Cystadenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor that arises from glandular epithelial cells and forms cystic structures. It is most commonly found in the ovaries and pancreas, but it can also develop in other organs. The exact cause of cystadenocarcinoma is not well understood, though genetic predisposition, chronic inflammation, and hormonal influences are thought to contribute to its development. The frequency of cystadenocarcinoma varies by type; for example, ovarian cystadenocarcinomas account for a significant proportion of ovarian cancers. This article will cover the different types of cystadenocarcinoma, its pathophysiology, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and epidemiology."
Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS),"Dyspnea, fatigue, palpitations, oliguria, back pain","Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is altered organ function in an acutely ill patient requiring immediate medical intervention.
There are different stages of organ dysfunction for certain different organs, both in acute and in chronic onset, whether or not there are one or more organs affected. Each stage of dysfunction (whether it be the heart, lung, liver, or kidney) has defined parameters, in terms of laboratory values based on blood and other tests, as to what it is (each of these organs' levels of failure is divided into stage I, II, III, IV, and V). The word ""failure"" is commonly used to refer to the later stages, especially IV and V, when artificial support usually becomes necessary to sustain life; the damage may or may not be fully or partially reversible.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome can trigger a variety of symptoms throughout the body."
Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection,"Fever, relapsing fever, remittent fever, abscess, soft tissue infection, pustule, cellulitis, ulcer, subcutaneous nodule, neonatal diarrhea, cough with sputum, purulent sputum","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common encapsulated, Gram-negative, aerobicfacultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium that can cause disease in plants and animals, including humans. A species of considerable medical importance, P. aeruginosa is a multidrug resistant pathogen recognized for its ubiquity, its intrinsically advanced antibiotic resistance mechanisms, and its association with serious illnesses  hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and various sepsis syndromes. P. aeruginosa is able to selectively inhibit various antibiotics from penetrating its outer membrane - and has high resistance to several antibiotics. According to the World Health Organization P. aeruginosa poses one of the greatest threats to humans in terms of antibiotic resistance.
The organism is considered opportunistic insofar as serious infection often occurs during existing diseases or conditions  most notably cystic fibrosis and traumatic burns."
Basal Cell Adenoma,Painless mass,"Basal cell adenoma is a rare, low-grade benign salivary gland neoplasm.
The most common involved site is the parotid gland, however other possible sites include the submandibular gland, minor salivary glands of upper lip, buccal mucosa, palate and nasal septum.
It appears as a slow-growing, firm and mobile mass.
Treatment is by surgical excision with a margin of healthy tissue. Although the recurrence rate is high, the prognosis is generally good."
Male Diseases,"Genital ulcers, warty lesions, genital herpes","A male genital disease is a condition that affects the male reproductive system. The human male genitals consist of testicles and epididymides, ductus deferentes, seminal vesicles and ejaculatory ducts, prostate, bulbourethral glands, and penis.

=== Inflammation ===
An example of a male genital disease is orchitis."
Pneumoconiosis,"Shortness of breath, coughing, difficulty breathing, chest pain","Pneumoconiosis is the general term for a class of interstitial lung disease where inhalation of dust (for example, ash dust, lead particles, pollen grains etc) has caused interstitial fibrosis. The three most common types are asbestosis, silicosis, and coal miner's lung. Pneumoconiosis often causes restrictive impairment, although diagnosable pneumoconiosis can occur without measurable impairment of lung function. Depending on extent and severity, it may cause death within months or years, or it may never produce symptoms. It is usually an occupational lung disease, typically from years of dust exposure during work in mining; textile milling; shipbuilding, ship repairing, and/or shipbreaking; sandblasting; industrial tasks; rock drilling (subways or building pilings); or agriculture."
Pediatric Hepatoblastoma,"Fatigue, abdominal mass, ascites, abdominal pain, anemia, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, decreased appetite, weight loss","Hepatoblastoma is a malignant liver cancer occurring in infants and children and composed of tissue resembling fetal liver cells, mature liver cells, or bile duct cells. They usually present with an abdominal mass.  The disease is most commonly diagnosed during a child's first three years of life. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels are commonly elevated, but when AFP is not elevated at diagnosis the prognosis is poor.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Patients are usually asymptomatic at diagnosis."
Keratosis Pilaris,"Papules, itching, severe pain","Keratosis pilaris  (KP; also follicular keratosis, lichen pilaris, or colloquially chicken skin.) is a common, autosomal-dominant, genetic condition of the skin's hair follicles characterized by the appearance of possibly itchy, small, gooseflesh-like bumps, with varying degrees of reddening or inflammation. It most often appears on the outer sides of the upper arms (the forearms can also be affected), thighs, face, back, and buttocks; KP can also occur on the hands, and tops of legs, sides, or any body part except glabrous (hairless) skin (like the palms or soles of feet). Often the lesions can appear on the face, which may be mistaken for acne or folliculitis.
The several types of KP have been associated with pregnancy, type 1 diabetes mellitus, obesity, dry skin, allergic diseases (e.g., atopic dermatitis), and rarely cancer. Many rarer types of the disorder are part of inherited genetic syndromes."
Pediatric Astrocytoma,"Unsteady holding of objects, locating signs, articulatory dyspraxia, increased intracranial pressure, tremors, balance dysfunction, forced head position","Pilocytic astrocytoma (and its variant pilomyxoid astrocytoma) is a brain tumor that occurs most commonly in children and young adults (in the first 20 years of life). They usually arise in the cerebellum, near the brainstem, in the hypothalamic region, or the optic chiasm, but they may occur in any area where astrocytes are present, including the cerebral hemispheres and the spinal cord. These tumors are usually slow growing and benign, corresponding to WHO malignancy grade 1.


== Signs and symptoms ==

Children affected by pilocytic astrocytoma can present with different symptoms that might include failure to thrive (lack of appropriate weight gain/ weight loss), headache, nausea, vomiting, irritability, torticollis (tilt neck or wry neck), difficulty to coordinate movements, and visual complaints (including nystagmus). The complaints may vary depending on the location and size of the neoplasm."
Localized mesothelioma,"Cough, hypoglycemia, clubbing, chest pain","Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium). The area most commonly affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding each testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly."
Pediatric Vesicoureteral Reflux Syndrome,"Renal damage, chronic renal insufficiency, urinary tract infection, bladder irritation, chills, glomerulosclerosis","Pediatric urology is a surgical subspecialty of medicine dealing with the disorders of children's genitourinary systems. Pediatric urologists provide care for both boys and girls ranging from birth to early adult age. The most common problems are those involving disorders of urination, reproductive organs and testes.


== Focus areas ==
Some of the problems they deal with are:

== Pediatric urologists ==
In North America, most pediatric urologists are associated with children's hospitals. Training for board certification in pediatric urology typically consists of a surgery internship as part of a urology residency followed by subspecialty training in pediatric urology at a major children's hospital."
Laryngeal Leukoplakia,"Hoarseness, throat itchiness, pain","Erythroplakia is a clinical term to describe any erythematous (red) area on a mucous membrane, that cannot be attributed to any other pathology.:805
The term erythroplasia was coined by Louis Queyrat to describe a precancerous red lesion of the penis. This gave rise to the term erythoplasia of Queyrat. Depending upon the context, this term may refer specifically to carcinoma in situ of the glans penis or vulva appearing as a red patch, or may be used as a synonym of erythroplasia on other mucous membrane or transitional sites.
It mainly affects the glans penis (the head of the penis), although uncommonly it may present on the mucous membranes of the larynx, and rarely, the mouth, or the anus.
Erythroplakia is analogous to the term leukoplakia which describes white patches."
Ischemic Hypoxic Encephalopathy,"Irritability, neonatal somnolence, sluggish response, convulsions, hypoxemia, abnormal pupils, fainting, grayish cheeks, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, cyanosis, hypercapnia, cerebral hypoxia","Cerebral hypoxia is a form of hypoxia (reduced supply of oxygen), specifically involving the brain; when the brain is completely deprived of oxygen, it is called cerebral anoxia. There are four categories of cerebral hypoxia; they are, in order of increasing severity: diffuse cerebral hypoxia (DCH), focal cerebral ischemia, cerebral infarction, and global cerebral ischemia. Prolonged hypoxia induces neuronal cell death via apoptosis, resulting in a hypoxic brain injury.
Cases of total oxygen deprivation are termed ""anoxia"", which can be hypoxic in origin (reduced oxygen availability) or ischemic in origin (oxygen deprivation due to a disruption in blood flow). Brain injury as a result of oxygen deprivation either due to hypoxic or anoxic mechanisms is generally termed hypoxic/anoxic injury (HAI)."
Spinal Metastatic Cancer,"Motor function impairment, spinal cord compression, sensory disturbance, weight loss","Spinal tumors are neoplasms located in either the vertebral column or the spinal cord. There are three main types of spinal tumors classified based on their location: extradural and intradural (intradural-intramedullary and intradural-extramedullary). Extradural tumors are located outside the dura mater lining and are most commonly metastatic. Intradural tumors are located inside the dura mater lining and are further subdivided into intramedullary and extramedullary tumors. Intradural-intramedullary tumors are located within the dura and spinal cord parenchyma, while intradural-extramedullary tumors are located within the dura but outside the spinal cord parenchyma."
Primary Esophageal Malignant Melanoma,"Dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain, upper abdominal discomfort, hematemesis and melena, impression formation on the left wall of the esophagus, esophageal obstruction, pigmented skin lesions, esophageal ulceration, hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation, skin metastasis, lymphadenopathy","Esophageal cancer (American English) or oesophageal cancer (British English) is cancer arising from the esophagusthe food pipe that runs between the throat and the stomach. Symptoms often include difficulty in swallowing and weight loss. Other symptoms may include pain when swallowing, a hoarse voice, enlarged lymph nodes (""glands"") around the collarbone, a dry cough, and possibly coughing up or vomiting blood.
The two main sub-types of the disease are esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (often abbreviated to ESCC), which is more common in the developing world, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which is more common in the developed world. A number of less common types also occur."
Lung Tumor,"Difficulty in breathing, foul-smelling sputum, fever, cough, expectoration, hemoptysis","Lung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma, is a malignant tumor that begins in the lung. Lung cancer is caused by genetic damage to the DNA of cells in the airways, often caused by cigarette smoking or inhaling damaging chemicals. Damaged airway cells gain the ability to multiply unchecked, causing the growth of a tumor. Without treatment, tumors spread throughout the lung, damaging lung function. Eventually lung tumors metastasize, spreading to other parts of the body."
Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma,"Nodules, Papules, Thermalgia","Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is a rare tumor, first characterized by Sharon Weiss and Franz Enzinger in 1982 that both clinically and histologically is intermediate between angiosarcoma and hemangioma. However, a distinct, disease-defining genetic alteration recently described for EHE indicates that it is an entirely separate entity from both angiosarcoma and hemangioma.
EHE is a soft tissue sarcoma and is generally considered a vascular cancer insofar as the lesional cells have surface markers typical of endothelial cells (cells lining the interior of blood vessels). EHE was originally described as occurring most commonly in the veins of the extremities (arms and legs) and two organs, the liver and lungs. It has since been described in organs throughout the body."
Pediatric Splenic Injury,"Prominent history of abdominal trauma, pain in the left hypochondrium, possible accompanying rib fractures, hypovolemic shock","Major trauma is any injury that has the potential to cause prolonged disability or death. There are many causes of major trauma, blunt and penetrating, including falls, motor vehicle collisions, stabbing wounds, and gunshot wounds. Depending on the severity of injury, quickness of management, and transportation to an appropriate medical facility (called a trauma center) may be necessary to prevent loss of life or limb. The initial assessment is critical, and involves a physical evaluation and also may include the use of imaging tools to determine the types of injuries accurately and to formulate a course of treatment.
In 2002, unintentional and intentional injuries were the fifth and seventh leading causes of deaths worldwide, accounting for 6.23% and 2.84% of all deaths."
Malignant Mixed Mllerian Tumor of the Vagina,"Vaginal bleeding, increased vaginal discharge, foul-smelling discharge","Vaginal tumors are neoplasms (tumors) found in the vagina. They can be benign or malignant. A neoplasm is an abnormal growth of tissue that usually forms a tissue mass.
Vaginal neoplasms may be solid, cystic or of mixed type.
Vaginal cancers arise from vaginal tissue, with vaginal sarcomas develop from bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, blood vessels or other connective or supportive tissue."
Bronchogenic Cyst,"Chest tightness, bronchospasm, cyst formation, difficulty in inhalation","Bronchogenic cysts are small, solitary cysts or sinuses, most typically located in the region of the suprasternal notch or behind the manubrium.:682


== Clinical features ==
These cysts are mostly found in young adults and are rare in infancy. The usual symptoms are the result of compression by the cyst, e.g., difficulty breathing or swallowing, cough, and chest pain. Malignant degeneration has been reported in these cysts on rare occasions. Bronchogenic cysts are usually found in the middle mediastinum. Chest x-rays show a smooth density just in front of the trachea or main stem bronchi at the carinal level."
Hypertrophic Osteoarthropathy,"Joint pain, swelling, limited mobility, stiffness, worsening after fatigue or exposure to cold","Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is a medical condition combining clubbing and periostitis of the small hand joints, especially the distal interphalangeal joints and the metacarpophalangeal joints. Distal expansion of the long bones as well as painful, swollen joints and synovial villous proliferation are often seen. The condition may occur alone (primary), or it may be secondary to diseases like lung cancer. Among patients with lung cancer, it is most associated with adenocarcinoma and least associated with small cell lung cancer. These patients often get clubbing and increased bone deposition on long bones."
Right Atrial and Inferior Vena Cava Leiomyomatosis,"Heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic mass, palpitations, shortness of breath, hepatomegaly, arteriovenous shunting, right heart failure, increased nuclear fission figures, localized venous tenderness, abdominal pain, oliguria, ascites, palpitations","Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a kidney cancer that originates in the lining of the proximal convoluted tubule, a part of the very small tubes in the kidney that transport primary urine. RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, responsible for approximately 9095% of cases. It is more common in men (with a male-to-female ratio of up to 2:1). It is most commonly diagnosed in the elderly (especially in people over 75 years of age).
Initial treatment is most commonly either partial or complete removal of the affected kidney(s)."
Aortic Dissection,"Severe pain, frontal headache, neck pain, scapular referral pain, rapid heart rate, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, dissection hematoma, dizziness, confusion, paraplegia, abdominal pain","Aortic dissection (AD) occurs when an injury to the innermost layer of the aorta allows blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall, forcing the layers apart. In most cases, this is associated with a sudden onset of agonizing chest or back pain, often described as ""tearing"" in character. Vomiting, sweating, and lightheadedness may also occur. Damage to other organs may result from the decreased blood supply, such as stroke, lower extremity ischemia, or mesenteric ischemia. Aortic dissection can quickly lead to death from insufficient blood flow to the heart or complete rupture of the aorta."
Gallbladder Cancer,"Cachexia, sphincter dysfunction, gallbladder wall fibrosis, biliary colic, elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein, right upper quadrant pain, abdominal pain, enlarged gallbladder, gastrointestinal bloating, abdominal mass, gallbladder motility disorders, persistent severe right upper quadrant pain radiating to the right shoulder","Gallbladder cancer is a relatively uncommon cancer, with an incidence of fewer than 2 cases per 100,000 people per year in the United States. It is particularly common in central and South America, central and eastern Europe, Japan and northern India; it is also common in certain ethnic groups e.g. Native American Indians and Hispanics. If it is diagnosed early enough, it can be cured by removing the gallbladder, part of the liver and associated lymph nodes. Most often it is found after symptoms such as abdominal pain, jaundice and vomiting occur, and it has spread to other organs such as the liver."
Acute Pulmonary Edema,"Chest tightness, fear, cough, difficulty in breathing","Pulmonary edema (British English: oedema), also known as pulmonary congestion, is excessive fluid accumulation in the tissue or air spaces (usually alveoli) of the lungs. This leads to impaired gas exchange, most often leading to shortness of breath (dyspnea) which can progress to hypoxemia and respiratory failure. Pulmonary edema has multiple causes and is traditionally classified as cardiogenic (caused by the heart) or noncardiogenic (all other types not caused by the heart).
Various laboratory tests (CBC, troponin, BNP, etc.) and imaging studies (chest x-ray, CT scan, ultrasound) are often used to diagnose and classify the cause of pulmonary edema. 
Treatment is focused on three aspects: 

improving respiratory function,
treating the underlying cause, and
preventing further damage and allow full recovery to the lung."
Pilomatrix Carcinoma,"nodules, ulcers, plaque-like","Malignant pilomatricoma is a cutaneous condition characterized by a locally aggressive tumor composed of hair-matrix cells.:671


== Signs and symptoms ==
Malignant pilomatricoma usually manifests as a single firm, painless, movable, asymptomatic dermal or subcutaneous lump. It has been shown that the underlying skin can become ulcerated and exhibit severe discoloration; the latter is thought to be one of the few significant indicators of cancer. The head, neck, and back are frequent locations of occurrence. Their sizes range from 1 to 10 cm.


== Diagnosis ==
Grossly, removed tumors frequently have a grayish appearance, are cystoid, encapsulated, and have viscous fluids."
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Retinopathy,"Persistent fever, night sweats, diarrhea, emaciation","An ocular manifestation of a systemic disease is an eye condition that directly or indirectly results from a disease process in another part of the body. There are many diseases known to cause ocular or visual changes. Diabetes, for example, is the leading cause of new cases of blindness in those aged 2074, with ocular manifestations such as diabetic retinopathy and macular edema affecting up to 80% of those who have had the disease for 15 years or more. Other diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and hypertension are commonly found to have associated ocular symptoms.

Myelofibrosis,"Fatigue, Myelofibrosis, Abnormal sweating, Wasting, Hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly, Anemia, Weight loss","Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a rare bone marrow blood cancer. It is classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm, a group of cancers in which there is activation and growth of mutated cells in the bone marrow. This is most often associated with a somatic mutation in the JAK2, CALR, or MPL genes. In PMF, the bony aspects of bone marrow are remodeled in a process called osteosclerosis; in addition, fibroblasts secrete collagen and reticulin proteins that are collectively referred to as fibrosis. These two pathological processes compromise the normal function of bone marrow, resulting in decreased production of blood cells such as erythrocytes (red cells), granulocytes, and megakaryocytes."
Orbital Tumor,"A firm mass often palpable in the superomedial orbit, decreased vision, conjunctival congestion, and pain","An eye neoplasm is a tumor of the eye. A rare type of tumor, eye neoplasms can affect all parts of the eye, and can either be benign or malignant (cancerous), in which case it is known as eye cancer. Eye cancers can be primary (starts within the eye) or metastatic cancer (spread to the eye from another organ). The two most common cancers that spread to the eye from another organ are breast cancer and lung cancer. Other less common sites of origin include the prostate, kidney, thyroid, skin, colon and blood or bone marrow."
Pediatric Esophageal Foreign Bodies,"Dysphagia, pain during swallowing, difficulty in breathing, limited neck movement, etc.","An esophageal food bolus obstruction is a medical emergency caused by the obstruction of the esophagus by an ingested foreign body.
It is usually associated with diseases that may narrow the lumen of the esophagus, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, Schatzki rings, peptic strictures, webs, or cancers of the esophagus; rarely it can be seen in disorders of the movement of the esophagus, such as nutcracker esophagus.
While some esophageal food boli can pass by themselves or with the assistance of medications, some require the use of endoscopy to push the obstructing food into the stomach, or remove it from the esophagus. The use of glucagon, while common, has not been found to be useful.
Eponymous names include 'the steakhouse syndrome' and 'backyard barbeque syndrome'."
Metastatic Bone Tumors,"Anemia, neuralgia, cachexia, pain, intercostal neuralgia, abdominal pain, hip joint pain, neck pain, muscle atrophy","Metastasis is a pathogenic agent's spreading from an initial or primary site to a different or secondary site within the host's body; the term is typically used when referring to metastasis by a cancerous tumor.  The newly pathological sites, then, are metastases (mets). It is generally distinguished from cancer invasion, which is the direct extension and penetration by cancer cells into neighboring tissues.
Cancer occurs after cells are genetically altered to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. This uncontrolled proliferation by mitosis produces a primary heterogeneic tumour."
Spinal Muscular Atrophy,"Muscle weakness, muscle stiffness, numbness in muscle tissue","Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare neuromuscular disorder that results in the loss of motor neurons and progressive muscle wasting. It is usually diagnosed in infancy or early childhood and if left untreated it is the most common genetic cause of infant death. It may also appear later in life and then have a milder course of the disease. The common feature is the progressive weakness of voluntary muscles, with the arm, leg, and respiratory muscles being affected first. Associated problems may include poor head control, difficulties swallowing, scoliosis, and joint contractures."
Radiation-induced Neurological Injury,"Drowsiness, focal symptoms, dementia, transverse myelitis, paralysis, sensory disturbances, arteriosclerosis","Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), also known as radiation sickness or radiation poisoning, is a collection of health effects that are caused by being exposed to high amounts of ionizing radiation in a short period of time. Symptoms can start within an hour of exposure, and can last for several months. Early symptoms are usually nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite. In the following hours or weeks, initial symptoms may appear to improve, before the development of additional symptoms, after which either recovery or death follows.
ARS involves a total dose of greater than 0.7 Gy (70 rad), that generally occurs from a source outside the body, delivered within a few minutes."
Cerebral Arteriosclerosis,"Headache, dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, hand tremors, limb numbness, poor sleep, and memory decline","Arteriosclerosis, literally meaning ""hardening of the arteries"", is an umbrella term for a vascular disorder characterized by abnormal thickening, hardening, and loss of elasticity of the walls of arteries; this process gradually restricts the blood flow to one's organs and tissues and can lead to severe health risks brought on by atherosclerosis, which is a specific form of arteriosclerosis caused by the buildup of fatty plaques, cholesterol, and some other substances in and on the artery walls (it can be brought on by smoking, a bad diet, or many genetic factors).
Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of coronary artery disease (CAD) and stroke, with multiple genetic and environmental contributions. Genetic-epidemiologic studies have identified a long list of genetic and non-genetic risk factors for CAD. However, such studies indicate that family history is the most significant independent risk factor.


== Signs and symptoms ==
The signs and symptoms of arteriosclerosis depend on the vessel affected by the disease. If affecting cerebral or ophthalmic vessels, as in cerebrovascular accidents or transient ischemic attacks, signs and symptoms may include sudden weakness, facial or lower limb numbness, confusion, difficulty understanding speech, and problems seeing."
Lymphocytic Leukemia,"Fever, progressive anemia, and significant bleeding tendencies","Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. In CLL, the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell. In patients with CLL, B cell lymphocytes can begin to collect in their blood, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. These cells do not function well and crowd out healthy blood cells. CLL is divided into two main types:

Slow-growing CLL (indolent CLL)
Fast-growing CLL
Many people do not have any symptoms when they are first diagnosed."
Ovarian Tumors,"Abdominal pain, precocious puberty, abdominal pain in pregnant women, absence or underdevelopment of ovaries, tumor traction, significantly elevated serum testosterone levels, significant enlargement of the uterus (uterine enlargement exceeds gestational age), skin distension like drum","Ovarian tumors, or ovarian neoplasms, are tumors in the ovary. Not all are ovarian cancer. They consist of mainly solid tissue, while ovarian cysts contain fluid.
In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) divided ovarian tumours as 90% epithelial, 3% germ cell, and 2% sex cord-stromal types.


== Histopathologic classification ==

Tumor of the ovary vary remarkably as they may arise from any of the 3 cell types of the normal ovary."
Simple Goiter,"Goiter, coughing, difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, vomiting, nausea and vomiting, abnormal breathing","A goitre (British English), or goiter (American English), is a swelling in the neck resulting from an enlarged thyroid gland. A goitre can be associated with a thyroid that is not functioning properly.
Worldwide, over 90% of goitre cases are caused by iodine deficiency. The term is from the Latin gutturia, meaning throat. Most goitres are not cancerous (benign), though they may be potentially harmful."
Male Breast Cancer,"Lumps and swelling, skin indentation and wrinkling, nipple retraction, redness of the nipple or breast skin, abnormal nipple size","Male breast cancer (MBC) is a cancer in males that originates in their breasts. Males account for less than 1% of new breast cancers with about 20,000 new cases being diagnosed 
worldwide every year. Its incidence rates in males vs. females are, respectively, 0.4 and 66.7 per 100,000 person-years (person-years is the number of new cases divided by the product of the relevant population's size multiplied by the average number of years of observation, i.e. new cases  [population  years])."
Goodpasture's Syndrome,"Hemoptysis, dyspnea, hematuria, renal failure, rales, proteinuria, cough, acute renal failure, chest pain","Goodpasture syndrome (GPS), also known as antiglomerular basement membrane disease,  is a rare autoimmune disease in which antibodies attack the basement membrane in lungs and kidneys, leading to bleeding from the lungs, glomerulonephritis, and kidney failure. It is thought to attack the alpha-3 subunit of type IV collagen, which has therefore been referred to as Goodpasture's antigen. Goodpasture syndrome may quickly result in permanent lung and kidney damage, often leading to death. It is treated with medications that suppress the immune system such as corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, and with plasmapheresis, in which the antibodies are removed from the blood. Due to the GPS's rapid progression, the significant difficulty of treating the disease is identifying it early and making the appropriate response before severe damage occurs to the kidneys and or lungs."
Asbestos-Related Skin Disease,"Skin itching, bumps","Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium). The area most commonly affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding each testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly."
Cold Agglutinin Disease,"Cyanosis of the auricles, nasal tip, fingers, and toes","Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of high concentrations of circulating cold sensitive antibodies, usually IgM and autoantibodies that are also active at temperatures below 30 C (86 F), directed against red blood cells, causing them to agglutinate and undergo lysis. It is a form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, specifically one in which antibodies bind red blood cells only at low body temperatures, typically 2831 C.
When affected people's blood is exposed to cold temperatures (32 F (0 C; 273 K) to 50 F (10 C; 283 K)), certain proteins that normally attack bacteria (IgM antibodies) attach themselves to red blood cells and bind them together into clumps (agglutination). This eventually causes red blood cells to be prematurely destroyed (hemolysis) leading to anemia and other associated signs and symptoms.
Cold agglutinin disease can be primary (unknown cause) or secondary, due to an underlying condition such as an infection, another autoimmune disease, or certain cancers. Treatment depends on many factors including the severity of the condition, the signs and symptoms present in each person, and the underlying cause."
Pleomorphic Adenoma of the Parotid Gland,"Swelling in the parotid region, nodules, painless mass in the parotid gland, firm mass below the ear, swelling of the cheek, facial nerve paralysis","Pleomorphic adenoma (or benign mixed tumor) is a common benign salivary gland neoplasm characterised by neoplastic proliferation of epithelial (ductal) cells along with myoepithelial components, having a malignant potentiality. It is the most common type of salivary gland tumor and the most common tumor of the parotid gland. It derives its name from the architectural Pleomorphism (variable appearance) seen by light microscopy. It is also known as ""Mixed tumor, salivary gland type"", which refers to its dual origin from epithelial and myoepithelial elements as opposed to its pleomorphic appearance.


== Clinical presentation ==
The tumor is usually solitary and presents as a slow growing, painless, firm single nodular mass."
Pediatric Allergy,"Hoarseness, abdominal pain, hypotension, nausea and vomiting, cough, edema, diarrhea, itching, anxiety, dizziness, rash","Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS), also known as alpha-gal allergy or mammalian meat allergy (MMA), is a type of acquired allergy characterized by a delayed onset of symptoms (38 hours) after ingesting mammalian meat. The condition results from past exposure to certain tick bites and was first reported in 2002. Symptoms of the allergy vary greatly between individuals and include rash, hives, nausea or vomiting, difficulty breathing, drop in blood pressure, dizziness or faintness, diarrhea, severe stomach pain, and possible anaphylaxis.
Alpha-gal allergy is a reaction to the carbohydrate galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (""alpha-gal""), whereby the body is overloaded with immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies on exposure to the carbohydrate. Anti-gal is a human natural antibody that interacts specifically with the mammalian carbohydrate structure gal alpha 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc-R (the alpha-galactosyl epitope)."
Prostate Cancer,"Difficulty urinating, urinary retention, painful urination","Prostate cancer is the uncontrolled growth of cells in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system below the bladder. Abnormal growth of the prostate tissue is usually detected through screening tests, typically blood tests that check for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Those with high levels of PSA in their blood are at increased risk for developing prostate cancer. Diagnosis requires a biopsy of the prostate. If cancer is present, the pathologist assigns a Gleason score; a higher score represents a more dangerous tumor."
Prolonged Bedridden in the Elderly,"Lowered pain threshold, muscle atrophy, muscle contracture, lower back pain, kidney stones, edema, angina, constipation, tachycardia, malnutrition, decreased appetite, polyuria","Louis XIII (French pronunciation: [lwi tz]; sometimes called the Just; 27 September 1601  14 May 1643) was King of France from 1610 until his death in 1643 and King of Navarre (as Louis II) from 1610 to 1620, when the crown of Navarre was merged with the French crown.
Shortly before his ninth birthday, Louis became king of France and Navarre after his father Henry IV was assassinated. His mother, Marie de' Medici, acted as regent during his minority. Mismanagement of the kingdom and ceaseless political intrigues by Marie and her Italian favourites led the young king to take power in 1617 by exiling his mother and executing her followers, including Concino Concini, the most influential Italian at the French court.
Louis XIII, taciturn and suspicious, relied heavily on his chief ministers, first Charles d'Albert, duc de Luynes and then Cardinal Richelieu, to govern the Kingdom of France."
Lymphangitis,"Swollen lymph nodes, low-grade fever, night sweats, poor appetite, weakness, and weight loss","Lymphangitis is an inflammation or an infection of the lymphatic channels that occurs as a result of infection at a site distal to the channel. It may present as long red streaks spreading away from the site of infection. It is a possible medical emergency as involvement of the lymphatic system allows for an infection to spread rapidly. The most common cause of lymphangitis in humans is bacteria, in which case sepsis and death could result within hours if left untreated. The most commonly involved bacteria include Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A strep) and hemolytic streptococci."
Acute Cervical Soft Tissue Injury,"Neck pain, limited movement, mild cases experience pricking pain, while severe cases may feel as if cut by a knife or severe tearing pain","A cervical fracture, commonly called a broken neck, is a fracture of any of the seven cervical vertebrae in the neck. Examples of common causes in humans are traffic collisions and diving into shallow water. Abnormal movement of neck bones or pieces of bone can cause a spinal cord injury, resulting in loss of sensation, paralysis, or usually death soon thereafter (~1 min.), primarily via compromising neurological supply to the respiratory muscles and innervation to the heart.


== Causes ==

Considerable force is needed to cause a cervical fracture. Vehicle collisions and falls are common causes."
Fallopian Tube Tumor,"Intermittent vaginal discharge of yellowish watery fluid, irregular scanty bleeding, dull pain in the lower abdomen, sausage-like or irregularly shaped mass","Adenomatoid tumors are rare and benign mesothelial tumors, which arise from the lining of organs. It mainly presents in the genital tract, in regions such as the testis and epididymis. Because of this, researchers had a difficult time concluding that type of tumor has a mesothelial origin. Immunohistochemistry staining of tumor samples show that it is indeed positive for mesothelial-markers (calretinin, WT1, and CK6). It is the most common extratesticular neoplasm after lipoma, and accounts for 30% of these masses."
Pediatric Acute Cholecystitis and Cholangitis,"Main symptoms include abdominal pain, high fever, chills, occasional jaundice, continuous or intermittent dull or distended pain in the upper abdomen, or severe colicky pain, often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and high fever.","Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. Symptoms commonly include right lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever and decreased appetite. However, approximately 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms. Severe complications of a ruptured appendix include widespread, painful inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall and sepsis.
Appendicitis is primarily caused by a blockage of the hollow portion in the appendix."
Refractory Heart Failure,"Shortness of breath, orthopnea, cyanosis, ascites, edema, heart failure, limb coldness, dyspnea, right upper quadrant pain","Heart failure (HF), also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), is a syndrome caused by an impairment in the heart's ability to fill with and pump blood.
Although symptoms vary based on which side of the heart is affected, HF typically presents with shortness of breath, excessive fatigue, and bilateral leg swelling. The severity of the heart failure is mainly decided based on ejection fraction and also measured by the severity of symptoms. Other conditions that have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver disease, anemia, and thyroid disease.
Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excessive alcohol consumption, infection, and cardiomyopathy."
Brain Tumor,"Severe headaches, projectile vomiting, vision disturbances","A brain tumor (sometimes referred more commonly as brain cancer) occurs when a group of cells within the brain turn cancerous and grow out of control, creating a mass. There are two main types of tumors: malignant (cancerous) tumors and benign (non-cancerous) tumors. These can be further classified as primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which most commonly have spread from tumors located outside the brain, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the size of the tumor and the part of the brain that is involved. Where symptoms exist, they may include headaches, seizures, problems with vision, vomiting and mental changes."
Fatal Familial Insomnia,"Vivid dreams, ataxia, dysarthria, hallucinations, slurred speech, catatonia, progressive insomnia","Fatal insomnia is an extremely rare neurodegenerative  prion disease that results in trouble sleeping as its hallmark symptom. The majority of cases are familial (fatal familial insomnia [FFI]), stemming from a mutation in the PRNP gene, with the remainder of cases occurring  sporadically (sporadic fatal insomnia [sFI]). The problems with sleeping typically start out gradually and worsen over time. Eventually, the patient will succumb to total insomnia (agrypnia excitata), most often leading to other symptoms such as speech problems, coordination problems, and dementia. It results in death within a few months to a few years, and there is no known disease-modifying treatment."
Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA),"Decreased appetite, fatigue, breath smells like rotten apples","Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus. Signs and symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, deep gasping breathing, increased urination, weakness, confusion and occasionally loss of consciousness. A person's breath may develop a specific ""fruity"" or acetone smell. The onset of symptoms is usually rapid. People without a previous diagnosis of diabetes may develop DKA as the first obvious symptom."
Colorectal Carcinoid,"Diarrhea, watery stool or diarrhea, abdominal pain, edema, tachycardia, chest pain, asthma, episodic skin flushing","Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as bowel cancer, colon cancer, or rectal cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine). Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, abdominal pain and fatigue. Most colorectal cancers are due to lifestyle factors and genetic disorders. Risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red meat, processed meat, and alcohol."
Ventricular Aneurysm,"Chest tightness, chest pain, difficulty breathing, shortness of breath","Ventricular aneurysms are one of the many complications that may occur after a heart attack. The word aneurysm refers to a bulge or 'pocketing' of the wall or lining of a vessel commonly occurring in the blood vessels at the base of the septum, or within the aorta. In the heart, they usually arise from a patch of weakened tissue in a ventricular wall, which swells into a bubble filled with blood. This, in turn, may block the passageways leading out of the heart, leading to severely constricted blood flow to the body. Ventricular aneurysms can be fatal."
Acute Pyogenic Arthritis,"Chills and high fever, severe systemic symptoms, convulsions in children due to high fever, local joint redness, swelling, pain, significant tenderness, and increased synovial fluid with fluctuation","Acute septic arthritis, infectious arthritis, suppurative arthritis, pyogenic arthritis, osteomyelitis, or joint infection is the invasion of a joint by an infectious agent resulting in joint inflammation. Generally speaking, symptoms typically include redness, heat and pain in a single joint associated with a decreased ability to move the joint. Onset is usually rapid. Other symptoms may include fever, weakness and headache. Occasionally, more than one joint may be involved, especially in neonates, younger children and immunocompromised individuals."
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS),"Fever, sweating, headache, sore throat, nausea, anorexia, general malaise, joint and muscular pain","Immunodeficiency, also known as immunocompromise, is a state in which the immune system's ability to fight infectious diseases and cancer is compromised or entirely absent. Most cases are acquired (""secondary"") due to extrinsic factors that affect the patient's immune system. Examples of these extrinsic factors include HIV infection and environmental factors, such as nutrition. Immunocompromisation may also be due to genetic diseases/flaws such as SCID.
In clinical settings, immunosuppression by some drugs, such as steroids, can either be an adverse effect or the intended purpose of the treatment. Examples of such use is in organ transplant surgery as an anti-rejection measure and in patients with an overactive immune system, as in autoimmune diseases."
Appendiceal Cancer,"Abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea","Appendix cancer, also known as appendiceal cancer, is a very rare malignant tumor that forms in the vermiform appendix.
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are rare tumors with malignant potential. Primary lymphomas can occur in the appendix. Breast cancer, colon cancer, and tumors of the female genital tract may metastasize to the appendix.


== Diagnosis ==

Carcinoid tumors are the most common tumors of the appendix."
Gonococcal Arthritis,"Joint swelling, high fever with chills, migratory joint pain, muscle soreness, edema, fever accompanied by painful swollen joints","Acute septic arthritis, infectious arthritis, suppurative arthritis, pyogenic arthritis, osteomyelitis, or joint infection is the invasion of a joint by an infectious agent resulting in joint inflammation. Generally speaking, symptoms typically include redness, heat and pain in a single joint associated with a decreased ability to move the joint. Onset is usually rapid. Other symptoms may include fever, weakness and headache. Occasionally, more than one joint may be involved, especially in neonates, younger children and immunocompromised individuals."
Paralytic Ectropion,"Photophobia, tearing, stinging, eyelid spasm","Ectropion is a medical condition in which the lower eyelid turns outwards. It is one of the notable aspects of newborns exhibiting congenital harlequin-type ichthyosis, but ectropion can occur due to any weakening of tissue of the lower eyelid. The condition can be repaired surgically. Ectropion is also found in dogs as an inherited, developmental condition.


== Causes ==
Congenital
Aging
Scarring
Mechanical
Allergic
Facial nerve palsy
Anti-cancer treatments such as erlotinib, cetuximab, and panitumumab, which block the function of EGFR (the epidermal growth factor receptor)."
Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn Due to ABO/Rh Incompatibility,"Jaundice, poor appetite, low-grade fever, nausea","Hemolytic disease of the newborn, also known as hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, HDN, HDFN, or erythroblastosis fetalis, is an alloimmune condition that develops in a fetus at or around birth, when the IgG molecules (one of the five main types of antibodies) produced by the mother pass through the placenta. Among these antibodies are some which attack antigens on the red blood cells in the fetal circulation, breaking down and destroying the cells. The fetus can develop reticulocytosis and anemia. The intensity of this fetal disease ranges from mild to very severe, and fetal death from heart failure (hydrops fetalis) can occur. When the disease is moderate or severe, many erythroblasts (immature red blood cells) are present in the fetal blood, earning these forms of the disease the name erythroblastosis fetalis (British English: erythroblastosis foetalis
HDFN represents a breach of immune privilege for the fetus or some other form of impairment of the immune tolerance in pregnancy."
Mediastinal Tumor,"Chest pain, chest tightness, cough, facial edema, edema, dysphagia","A mediastinal tumor is a tumor in the mediastinum, the cavity that separates the lungs from the rest of the chest. It contains the heart, esophagus, trachea, thymus, and aorta. The most common mediastinal masses are thymoma (20% of mediastinal tumors), usually found in the anterior mediastinum, followed by neurogenic Timor (1520%) located in the anterior mediastinum. Lung cancer typically spreads to the lymph nodes in the mediastinum.
The mediastinum has three main  parts: the anterior mediastinum (front), the middle mediastinum, and the posterior mediastinum (back)."
Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation,"Absent megakaryocytic thrombocytopenia, thalassemia, myelofibrosis","Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) is the transplantation of multipotent hematopoietic stem cells, usually derived from bone marrow, peripheral blood, or umbilical cord blood, in order to replicate inside a patient and produce additional normal blood cells. HSCT may be autologous (the patient's own stem cells are used),  syngeneic (stem cells from an identical twin), or allogeneic (stem cells from a donor).
It is most often performed for patients with certain cancers of the blood or bone marrow, such as multiple myeloma, leukemia, some types of lymphoma and immune deficiencies. In these cases, the recipient's immune system is usually suppressed with radiation or chemotherapy before the transplantation. Infection and graft-versus-host disease are major complications of allogeneic HSCT.
HSCT remains a dangerous procedure with many possible complications; it is reserved for patients with life-threatening diseases."
Acute Appendicitis Complicating Pregnancy,"Abdominal pain not related to pregnancy, appendix perforation, peritonitis, and spasmodic uterine contractions in pregnant women","Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is a rare life-threatening complication of pregnancy that occurs in the third trimester or the immediate period after delivery.  It is thought to be caused by a disordered metabolism of fatty acids by mitochondria in the fetus, caused by long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency. This leads to decreased metabolism of long-chain fatty acids by the fetoplacental unit, causing a subsequent rise in hepatotoxic fatty acids in maternal plasma. The condition was previously thought to be universally fatal, but aggressive treatment by stabilizing the mother with intravenous fluids and blood products in anticipation of early delivery has improved prognosis.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (or hepatic lipidosis of pregnancy) usually manifests in the third trimester of pregnancy, but may occur any time in the second half of pregnancy, or the puerperium, the period immediately after delivery."
Abdominal Compartment Syndrome,"Abdominal pain, ascites, abdominal distension, gastrointestinal bloating","Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) occurs when the abdomen becomes subject to increased pressure reaching past the point of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH).  ACS is present when intra-abdominal pressure rises and is sustained at > 20 mmHg and there is new organ dysfunction or failure. ACS is classified into three groups: Primary, secondary and recurrent ACS.  It is not a disease and as such it occurs in conjunction with many disease processes, either due to the primary illness or in association with treatment interventions. Specific cause of abdominal compartment syndrome is not known, although some causes can be sepsis and severe abdominal trauma. Increasing pressure reduces blood flow to abdominal organs and impairs pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, and gastro-intestinal (GI) function, causing obstructive shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and death."
Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome,"Arrhythmia, Tachycardia","WolffParkinsonWhite syndrome (WPWS) is a disorder due to a specific type of problem with the electrical system of the heart involving an accessory pathway able to conduct electrical current between the atria and the ventricles, thus bypassing the atrioventricular node. About 60% of people with the electrical problem develop symptoms, which may include an abnormally fast heartbeat, palpitations, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or syncope. Rarely, cardiac arrest may occur. The most common type of irregular heartbeat that occurs is known as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
The cause of WPW is typically unknown and is likely due to a combination of chance and genetic factors."
Cutaneous Amebiasis,"Ulcers, abscesses, pustules, nodules, granulomas, abdominal pain with diarrhea, pruritus, inflammatory cell infiltration","Cutaneous amoebiasis,  refers to a form of amoebiasis that presents primarily in the skin. It can be caused by Acanthamoeba or Entamoeba histolytica.:421 When associated with Acanthamoeba, it is also known as ""cutaneous acanthamoebiasis"". Balamuthia mandrillaris can also cause cutaneous amoebiasis, but can prove fatal if the amoeba enters the bloodstream 
It is characterized by ulcers. Diagnosis of amebiasis cutis calls for high degree of clinical suspicion. This needs to be backed with demonstration of trophozoites from lesions."
Pneumocystis Pneumonia,"Shortness of breath, coughing, cyanosis, three-concave sign, difficulty breathing, restlessness, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, fever, dry cough","Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), also known as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), is a form of pneumonia that is caused by the yeast-like fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii.
Pneumocystis specimens are commonly found in the lungs of healthy people although it is usually not a cause for disease. However, they are a source of opportunistic infection and can cause lung infections in people with a weak immune system or other predisposing health conditions. PCP is seen in people with HIV/AIDS (who account for 30-40% of PCP cases), those using medications that suppress the immune system, and people with cancer, autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, and chronic lung disease.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms may develop over several days or weeks and may include: shortness of breath and/or difficulty breathing (of gradual onset), fever, dry/non-productive cough, weight loss, night sweats, chills, and fatigue."
Cosmetic Dermatitis,"Skin itching, swelling, peeling","Contact dermatitis is a type of acute or chronic inflammation of the skin caused by exposure to chemical or physical agents. Symptoms of contact dermatitis can include itchy or dry skin, a red rash, bumps, blisters, or swelling. These rashes are not contagious or life-threatening, but can be very uncomfortable.
Contact dermatitis results from either exposure to allergens (allergic contact dermatitis), or irritants (irritant contact dermatitis). Allergic contact dermatitis involves a delayed type of hypersensitivity and previous exposure to an allergen to produce a reaction."
Post-traumatic Hydrocephalus,"Hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, coma, unstable gait, urinary incontinence, emotional indifference, restlessness, dementia, ataxia, sensory disturbances","Post-traumatic seizures (PTS) are seizures that result from traumatic brain injury (TBI), brain damage caused by physical trauma. PTS may be a risk factor for or a symptom of post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE), but a person having a seizure or seizures due to traumatic brain injury does not necessarily have PTE. ""PTS"" and ""PTE"" may be used interchangeably in medical literature.
Seizures are usually an indication of a more severe TBI.  Seizures that occur shortly after a person sustains a brain injury may further damage the already vulnerable brain. They may reduce the amount of oxygen available to the brain, cause excitatory neurotransmitters to be released in excess, increase the brain's metabolic need, and raise the pressure within the intracranial space, further contributing to damage. Thus, people who sustain severe head trauma are given anticonvulsant medications as a precaution against seizures."
Congenital Aortic Stenosis,"Hypertension, shortness of breath, tachycardia, feeding difficulties, epistaxis, weakness in the lower limbs, coolness in the lower limbs, intermittent claudication, hepatomegaly, cardiac enlargement, systolic murmur, and bounding pulse","Aortic stenosis (AS or AoS) is the narrowing  of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aorta begins), such that problems result. It may occur at the aortic valve as well as above and below this level. It typically gets worse over time. Symptoms often come on gradually with a decreased ability to exercise often occurring first. If heart failure, loss of consciousness, or heart related chest pain occur due to AS the outcomes are worse."
Pediatric Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS),"Anemia, bleeding, fever, infections, hepatosplenomegaly","Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disease characterized by aplastic anemia, congenital defects, endocrinological abnormalities, and an increased incidence of developing cancer. The study of Fanconi anemia has improved scientific understanding of the mechanisms of normal bone marrow function and the development of cancer. Among those affected, the majority develop cancer, most often acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and liver cancer. 90% develop aplastic anemia (the inability to produce blood cells) by age 40. About 6075% have congenital defects, commonly short stature, abnormalities of the skin, arms, head, eyes, kidneys, and ears, and developmental disabilities."
Pediatric Torsades de Pointes,"Arrhythmia, pallor, cyanosis, restlessness and crying in children, lethargy, abnormal heart sounds, seizures, syncope, heart murmurs, bradycardia, cardiac arrest","Pediatric advanced life support (PALS) is a course offered by the American Heart Association (AHA) for health care providers who take care of children and infants in the emergency room, critical care and intensive care units in the hospital, and out of hospital (emergency medical services (EMS)). The course teaches healthcare providers how to assess injured and sick children and recognize and treat respiratory distress/failure, shock, cardiac arrest, and arrhythmias.


== Basic Life Support (BLS) ==

PALS builds upon AHA's Pediatric Basic Life Support (BLS). Providers should follow the AHA's Pediatric BLS Algorithms for single and  2 person rescuer. The most essential component of BLS and PALS cardiac arrest care is high quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)."
Heat Exhaustion,"High fever, dizziness, confusion, palpitations, shock, coma, seizures, nausea and vomiting, dehydration","Heat exhaustion is a heat-related illness characterized by the body's inability to effectively cool itself, typically occurring in high ambient temperatures or during intense physical exertion. In heat exhaustion, core body temperature ranges from 37 C to 40 C (98.6 F to 104 F). Symptoms include profuse sweating, weakness, dizziness, headache, nausea, and lowered blood pressure, resulting from dehydration and serum electrolyte depletion. Heat-related illnesses lie on a spectrum of severity, where heat exhaustion is considered less severe than heat stroke but more severe than heat cramps and heat syncope.
Climate change and increasing global temperatures have led to more frequent and intense heat waves, raising the incidence of heat exhaustion."
Neonatal Purpura,"Rash, diarrhea, scalp scabbing, skin petechiae, purpura, cyanosis, skin ecchymosis, periorbital ecchymosis, skin purpura, skin bleeding spots, neonatal cyanosis, hematochezia","Purpura fulminans is an acute, often fatal, thrombotic disorder which manifests as blood spots, bruising and discolouration of the skin resulting from coagulation in small blood vessels within the skin and rapidly leads to skin necrosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation.


== Causes ==

Purpura fulminans is caused by defects in the protein C anticoagulant pathway. Identification of the cause of purpura fulminans often depends on the patient's age and circumstances of presentation.


=== Congenital protein C deficiency ===
Congenital (inherited) defects in protein C activity are autosomal dominant and may be partial or severe loss of function. Hundreds of natural mutations of the protein C gene (PROC) have been identified."
Infantile Myofibromatosis,"Multiple firm dermal and subcutaneous nodules, appearing at birth or shortly thereafter, commonly located on the head, neck, and trunk.","Infantile myofibromatosis (IMF) is a rare tumor found in 1 in 150,000 to 1 in 400,000 live births. It is nonetheless the most common tumor derived from fibrous connective tissue that occurs primarily in infants and young children. IMF tumors are benign in the sense that they do not metastasize to distant tissues although when occurring in the viscera, i.e. internal organs, carry guarded to poor prognoses and can be life-threatening, particularly in newborns and young infants. The condition was first described by Arthur Purdy Stout as congenital generalized fibromatosis  in which he coined the word fibromatosis  in 1954."
Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS),"Fever, headache, pain in the orbit, back pain, nausea and vomiting, edema, renal tenderness, hypotension, oliguria and polyuria, facial flushing, redness of the neck and chest","Hantavirus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a hemorrhagic fever caused by hantaviruses. Symptoms usually occur 1216 days after exposure to the virus and come in five distinct phases: febrile, hypotensive, low urine production (oliguric), high urine production (diuretic), and recovery. Early symptoms include headache, lower back pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, bloody stool, the appearance of spots on the skin, bleeding in the respiratory tract, and renal symptoms such as kidney swelling, excess protein in urine, and blood in urine. During the hypotensive phase, blood pressure lowers due to microvascular leakage. Renal failure then causes the diuretic phase, before recovering and increasing urine production as disease progression improves."
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC),"Seizures and seizure-like episodes, angiofibromas, hypomelanotic macules (ash leaf spots), cognitive impairment, tubers, café-au-lait spots, infantile spasms, paralysis, ataxia, intracranial hypertension, hydrocephalus, and microphthalmia","Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare multisystem autosomal dominant genetic disease that causes non-cancerous tumours to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, liver, eyes, lungs and skin. A combination of symptoms may include seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delay, behavioral problems, skin abnormalities, lung disease, and kidney disease.
TSC is caused by a mutation of either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which code for the proteins hamartin and tuberin, respectively, with TSC2 mutations accounting for the majority and tending to cause more severe symptoms. These proteins act as tumor growth suppressors, agents that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation.
Prognosis is highly variable and depends on the symptoms, but life expectancy is normal for many."
Autosomal Recessive Hereditary Cerebral Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy,"Headache, dizziness, palpitations, shortness of breath, heart palpitations","CADASIL or CADASIL syndrome, involving cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, is the most common form of hereditary stroke disorder and is thought to be caused by mutations of the NOTCH3 gene on chromosome 19. The disease belongs to a family of disorders called the leukodystrophies. The most common clinical manifestations are migraine headaches and transient ischemic attacks or strokes, which usually occur between 40 and 50 years of age, although MRI is able to detect signs of the disease years prior to clinical manifestation of disease.
The condition was identified and named by French researchers Marie-Germaine Bousser and Elisabeth Tournier-Lasserve in the 1990s. Together with two other researchers, Hugues Chabriat and Anne Joutel, they received the 2019 Brain Prize for their research into the condition."
Cutaneous B-cell Lymphoid Hyperplasia,"Papules, nodules, yellow nodules","Tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues (American English) or tumours of the haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues (British English) are tumors that affect the blood, bone marrow, lymph, and lymphatic system. Because these tissues are all intimately connected through both the circulatory system and the immune system, a disease affecting one will often affect the others as well, making aplasia, myeloproliferation and lymphoproliferation (and thus the leukemias, myelomas, and the lymphomas) closely related and often overlapping problems.
While uncommon in solid tumors, chromosomal translocations are a common cause of these diseases. This commonly leads to a different approach in diagnosis and treatment of hematological malignancies.
Hematological malignancies are malignant neoplasms (""cancer""), and they are generally treated by specialists in hematology and/or oncology."
Hodgkin Lymphoma in the Elderly,"Lymphadenopathy, fever, night sweats, weight loss","Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a type of lymphoma in which cancer originates from a specific type of white blood cell called lymphocytes, where multinucleated ReedSternberg cells (RS cells) are present in the lymph nodes. The condition was named after the English physician Thomas Hodgkin, who first described it in 1832. Symptoms may include fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Often, non-painful enlarged lymph nodes occur in the neck, under the arm, or in the groin. Persons affected may feel tired or be itchy."
Tongue Cancer,"Difficulty swallowing, glossitis, persistent non-healing ulcers on the tongue, tongue pain, difficulty eating, limited tongue movement","Oral cancer, also known as oral cavity cancer, tongue cancer or mouth cancer, is a cancer of the lining of the lips, mouth, or upper throat. In the mouth, it most commonly starts as a painless red or white patch, that thickens, gets ulcerated and continues to grow. When on the lips, it commonly looks like a persistent crusting ulcer that does not heal, and slowly grows. Other symptoms may include difficult or painful swallowing, new lumps or bumps in the neck, a swelling in the mouth, or a feeling of numbness in the mouth or lips.
Risk factors include tobacco and alcohol use."
Locked-In Syndrome,"Complete paralysis of all limbs, inability to speak, horizontal eye movement disorder, bilateral facial paralysis","Locked-in syndrome (LIS), also known as pseudocoma, is a condition in which a patient is aware but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis of nearly all voluntary muscles in their body except for vertical eye movements and blinking. The individual is conscious and sufficiently intact cognitively to be able to communicate with eye movements. Electroencephalography results are normal in locked-in syndrome.
Total locked-in syndrome, or completely locked-in state (CLIS), is a version of locked-in syndrome wherein the eyes are paralyzed as well. Fred Plum and Jerome B. Posner coined the term for this disorder in 1966."
Ductal Carcinoma of the Breast,"Enlarged breast, lump in the breast, enlarged lymph nodes","Invasive carcinoma of no special type (invasive carcinoma NST), invasive breast carcinoma of no special type (IBC-NST), invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC) or invasive ductal carcinoma, not otherwise specified (NOS) is a disease. For international audiences this article will use ""invasive carcinoma NST"" because it is the preferred term of the World Health Organization (WHO).
Invasive carcinoma NST accounts for half of all breast cancer diagnoses in women and is the most common type of invasive breast cancer. It is also the most commonly diagnosed form of male breast cancer. Invasive carcinoma NST is classified by its microscopic, molecular, and genetic features."
Pulmonary Injury,"Bleeding, difficulty in breathing, cyanosis","Vaping-associated pulmonary injury (VAPI), also known as vaping-associated lung injury (VALI) or e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (E/VALI), is an umbrella term, used to describe lung diseases associated with the use of vaping products that can be severe and life-threatening. Symptoms can initially mimic common pulmonary diagnoses, such as pneumonia, but sufferers typically do not respond to antibiotic therapy. Differential diagnoses have overlapping features with VAPI, including COVID-19. According to a systematic review article, ""Initial case reports of vaping-related lung injury date back to 2012, but the ongoing outbreak of EVALI began in the summer of 2019.""  In the recent years many cases were initially misdiagnosed as COVID-19.
Sufferers usually present for care within a few days to weeks of symptom onset."
Male Urethral Cancer,"Difficulty urinating and urinary retention, dysuria, discharge from the urethra, hematuria, urethral stricture, bead-like lumps in the urethra, pain at the urethral meatus, urethral fistula, urinary tract obstruction","Urethral cancer is a rare cancer originating from the urethra. The disease has been classified by the TNM staging system and the World Health Organization.
Symptoms include blood in the urine, lump at end of penis, or bloody penile discharge.
Diagnosis is established by transurethral biopsy.
The most common type is papillary urothelial carcinoma."
Colorectal Malignant Lymphoma,"Ulcers, nodular polypoid mass, polyps, disappearance of the semilunar folds of the colon pouch","Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as bowel cancer, colon cancer, or rectal cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine). Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, abdominal pain and fatigue. Most colorectal cancers are due to lifestyle factors and genetic disorders. Risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red meat, processed meat, and alcohol."
Neuroendocrine Tumors,"Sudden or persistent flushing of the face or skin on the trunk, mild to moderate diarrhea, abdominal pain, skin telangiectasia, occasional rash, dementia","Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous systems. They most commonly occur in the intestine, where they are often called carcinoid tumors, but they are also found in the pancreas, lung, and the rest of the body.
Although there are many kinds of NETs, they are treated as a group of tissue because the cells of these neoplasms share common features, including a similar histological appearance, having special secretory granules, and often producing biogenic amines and polypeptide hormones.
The term ""neuro"" refers to the dense core granules (DCGs), similar to the DCGs in the serotonergic neurons storing monoamines. The term ""endocrine"" refers to the synthesis and secretion of these monoamines."
Pulmonary Aspergillosis,"Cough with phlegm, cough, dyspnea, fever, weight loss, hemoptysis, coma, anorexia, chest tightness, convulsion","Aspergillosis is a fungal infection of usually the lungs, caused by the genus Aspergillus, a common mold that is breathed in frequently from the air, but does not usually affect most people. It generally occurs in people with lung diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis or tuberculosis, or those who are immunocompromised such as those who have had a stem cell or organ transplant or those who take medications such as steroids and some cancer treatments which suppress the immune system. Rarely, it can affect skin.
Aspergillosis occurs in humans, birds and other animals. Aspergillosis occurs in chronic or acute forms which are clinically very distinct."
Congenital Heart Disease,"Exercise-induced dyspnea, cyanosis, syncope","A congenital heart defect (CHD), also known as a congenital heart anomaly, congenital cardiovascular malformation, and congenital heart disease, is a defect in the structure of the heart or great vessels that is present at birth. A congenital heart defect is classed as a cardiovascular disease. Signs and symptoms depend on the specific type of defect. Symptoms can vary from none to life-threatening. When present, symptoms are variable and may include rapid breathing, bluish skin (cyanosis), poor weight gain, and feeling tired."
Hepatorenal Syndrome,"Hematuria, jaundice, spider angiomas, palmar erythema, splenomegaly, ascites, edema of legs and feet, eyelid edema","Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a life-threatening medical condition that consists of rapid deterioration in kidney function in individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. HRS is usually fatal unless a liver transplant is performed, although various treatments, such as dialysis, can prevent advancement of the condition.
HRS can affect individuals with cirrhosis, severe alcoholic hepatitis, or liver failure, and usually occurs when liver function deteriorates rapidly because of a sudden insult such as an infection, bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, or overuse of diuretic medications.  HRS is a relatively common complication of cirrhosis, occurring in 18% of people within one year of their diagnosis, and in 39% within five years of their diagnosis. Deteriorating liver function is believed to cause changes in the circulation that supplies the intestines, altering blood flow and blood vessel tone in the kidneys."
Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans,"Halo phenomenon, hepatosplenomegaly, somnolence, myalgia, nodules, pruritus, edema, headache","Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare locally aggressive malignant cutaneous soft-tissue sarcoma. DFSP develops in the connective tissue cells in the middle layer of the skin (dermis). Estimates of the overall occurrence of DFSP in the United States are 0.8 to 4.5 cases per million persons per year.  In the United States, DFSP accounts for between 1 and 6 percent of all soft-tissue sarcomas and 18 percent of all cutaneous soft-tissue sarcomas. In the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) tumor registry from 1992 through 2004, DFSP was second only to Kaposi sarcoma."
Chronic Mucocutaneous Candidiasis,"Erythematous rash, Anemia","Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis is an immune disorder of T cells. It is characterized by chronic infections with Candida that are limited to mucosal surfaces, skin, and nails.:310 It can also be associated with other types of infections, such as human papilloma virus. An association with chromosome 2 has been identified.


== Types ==


== Signs and symptoms ==
The signs and symptoms of this condition are thickened skin, skin ulcer, dyspareunia, endocardium abnormality, vision problems, hepatitis, seizures, bloody urine, and meningitis.


=== Associated diseases or conditions ===
There are a number of disorders associated with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis including endocrine dysfunctions, vitiligo, malabsorption syndromes, neoplasms, and others."
Pediatric Hematuria,"Hematuria, Urinary System Infection, Fever","Hematuria or haematuria is defined as the presence of blood or red blood cells in the urine. ""Gross hematuria"" occurs when urine appears red, brown, or tea-colored due to the presence of blood. Hematuria may also be subtle and only detectable with a microscope or laboratory test. Blood that enters and mixes with the urine can come from any location within the urinary system, including the kidney, ureter, urinary bladder, urethra, and in men, the prostate. Common causes of hematuria include urinary tract infection (UTI), kidney stones, viral illness, trauma, bladder cancer, and exercise."
Ductal Ectasia of the Breast,"Nipple discharge, redness, swelling, warmth, and tenderness within the areola area","Duct ectasia of the breast, mammary duct ectasia or plasma cell mastitis is a condition that occurs when a milk duct beneath the nipple widens, the duct walls thicken, and the duct fills with fluid. This is the most common cause of greenish discharge.
Mammary duct ectasia can mimic breast cancer. It is a disorder of peri- or post-menopausal age.
Duct ectasia syndrome is a synonym for nonpuerperal mastitis, but the term has also been occasionally used to describe special cases of fibrocystic diseases or mastalgia or as a wastebasket definition of benign breast disease."
Recurrent Retroperitoneal Tumor,"Abdominal mass, bloating, abdominal pain, hidden pain, severe pain","Liposarcomas are the most common subtype of soft tissue sarcomas, accounting for at least 20% of all sarcomas in adults. Soft tissue sarcomas are rare neoplasms with over 150 different histological subtypes or forms. Liposarcomas arise from the precursor lipoblasts of the adipocytes (i.e. fat cells) in adipose (i.e. fat) tissues."
Ovarian Malignant Peritoneal Mesothelioma,"Abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, ascites, abdominal mass, loss of appetite, fatigue, weight loss","Ovarian cancer is a cancerous tumor of an ovary. It may originate from the ovary itself or more commonly from communicating nearby structures such as fallopian tubes or the inner lining of the abdomen. The ovary is made up of three different cell types including epithelial cells, germ cells, and stromal cells. When these cells become abnormal, they have the ability to divide and form tumors. These cells can also invade or spread to other parts of the body."
Primary Mesenteric Tumor,"Abdominal mass, consistent dull or achy abdominal pain, weight loss, ascites may cause abdominal distension","Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous systems. They most commonly occur in the intestine, where they are often called carcinoid tumors, but they are also found in the pancreas, lung, and the rest of the body.
Although there are many kinds of NETs, they are treated as a group of tissue because the cells of these neoplasms share common features, including a similar histological appearance, having special secretory granules, and often producing biogenic amines and polypeptide hormones.
The term ""neuro"" refers to the dense core granules (DCGs), similar to the DCGs in the serotonergic neurons storing monoamines. The term ""endocrine"" refers to the synthesis and secretion of these monoamines."
Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"Irregular vaginal bleeding, contact bleeding, abnormal vaginal discharge, foul-smelling, bloody leukorrhea","Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), also known as cervical dysplasia, is the abnormal growth of cells on the surface of the cervix that could potentially lead to cervical cancer. More specifically, CIN refers to the potentially precancerous transformation of cells of the cervix.
CIN most commonly occurs at the squamocolumnar junction of the cervix, a transitional area between the squamous epithelium of the vagina and the columnar epithelium of the endocervix. It can also occur in vaginal walls and vulvar epithelium. CIN is graded on a 13 scale, with 3 being the most abnormal (see classification section below)."
Diastolic Heart Failure,"Dyspnea on recumbency, exertional dyspnea, rapid breathing, lower limb edema, abdominal distension, oliguria","Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a form of heart failure in which the ejection fraction  the percentage of the volume of blood ejected from the left ventricle with each heartbeat divided by the volume of blood when the left ventricle is maximally filled  is normal, defined as greater than 50%; this may be measured by echocardiography or cardiac catheterization. Approximately half of people with heart failure have preserved ejection fraction, while the other half have a reduction in ejection fraction, called heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
Risk factors for HFpEF include hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, smoking, and obstructive sleep apnea.
HFpEF is characterized by abnormal diastolic function: there is an increase in the stiffness of the left ventricle, which causes a decrease in left ventricular relaxation during diastole, with resultant increased pressure and/or impaired filling.  There is an increased risk for atrial fibrillation and pulmonary hypertension."
Traumatic Subdural Effusion,"Lethargic state, coma, abnormal pupil, vomiting, edema, sheath effusion, headache, vertigo, syncope, increased intracranial pressure, mental disorders, decerebrate rigidity","A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a type of bleeding in which a collection of bloodusually but not always associated with a traumatic brain injurygathers between the inner layer of the dura mater and the arachnoid mater of the meninges surrounding the brain. It usually results from rips in bridging veins that cross the subdural space.
Subdural hematomas may cause an increase in the pressure inside the skull, which in turn can cause compression of and damage to delicate brain tissue. Acute subdural hematomas are often life-threatening. Chronic subdural hematomas have a better prognosis if properly managed."
Intraocular Metastatic Tumor,Visual Impairment,"Uveal melanoma is a type of eye cancer in the uvea of the eye. It is traditionally classed as originating in the iris, choroid, and ciliary body, but can also be divided into class I (low metastatic risk) and class II (high metastatic risk). Symptoms include blurred vision, loss of vision, and photopsia, but there may be no symptoms.
Tumors arise from the pigment cells that reside within the uvea and give color to the eye. These melanocytes are distinct from the retinal pigment epithelium cells underlying the retina that do not form melanomas."
Pituitary Adenoma,"Amenorrhea, galactorrhea, infertility, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, breast development, sparse facial hair, headache","Pituitary adenomas are tumors that occur in the pituitary gland. Most pituitary tumors are benign, approximately 35% are invasive and just 0.1% to 0.2% are carcinomas. Pituitary adenomas represent from 10% to 25% of all intracranial neoplasms, with an estimated prevalence rate in the general population of approximately 17%.
Non-invasive and non-secreting pituitary adenomas are considered to be benign in the literal as well as the clinical sense, though a 2011 meta-analysis of available research showed that research to either support or refute this assumption was scant and of questionable quality.
Adenomas exceeding 10 mm (0.39 in) in size are defined as macroadenomas, while those smaller than 10 mm (0.39 in) are referred to as microadenomas."
Relapsing Polychondritis Associated with Uveitis,"Nosebleed, Nasal Congestion, Conductive Hearing Loss, Proteinuria, Night Sweats, Ear Auricle Swelling and Redness, Deafness, Scleral Perforation","Relapsing polychondritis is a systemic disease characterized by repeated episodes of inflammation and in some cases deterioration of cartilage. The disease can be life-threatening if the respiratory tract, heart valves, or blood vessels are affected. The exact mechanism is poorly understood.
The diagnosis is reached on the basis of the symptoms and supported by investigations such as blood tests and sometimes other investigations. Treatment may involve symptomatic treatment with painkillers or anti-inflammatory medications, and more severe cases may require suppression of the immune system."
Pediatric Liver Tumor,"Mild anemia, ascites, jaundice, weight loss, fever, visible veins on the abdominal wall, difficulty breathing, pain, and potential for multiple fractures","Liver cancer, also known as hepatic cancer, primary hepatic cancer, or primary hepatic malignancy, is cancer that starts in the liver. Liver cancer can be primary in which the cancer starts in the liver, or it can be liver metastasis, or secondary, in which the cancer spreads from elsewhere in the body to the liver. Liver metastasis is the more common of the two liver cancers. Instances of liver cancer are increasing globally. 
Primary liver cancer is globally the sixth-most frequent cancer and the fourth-leading cause of death from cancer."
Postpartum Dyspnea,"Cough, shortness of breath, wheezing","Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a form of dilated cardiomyopathy that is defined as a deterioration in cardiac function presenting typically between the last month of pregnancy and up to six months postpartum.  As with other forms of dilated cardiomyopathy, PPCM involves systolic dysfunction of the heart with a decrease of the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) with associated congestive heart failure and an increased risk of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, thromboembolism (blockage of a blood vessel by a blood clot), and even sudden cardiac death.  In essence, the heart muscle cannot contract forcefully enough to pump adequate amounts of blood for the needs of the body's vital organs.
PPCM is a diagnosis of exclusion, wherein patients have no prior history of heart disease and there are no other known possible causes of heart failure. Echocardiography is used to both diagnose and monitor the effectiveness of treatment for PPCM.
The cause of PPCM is unknown."
Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS),"Anemia, pallor, palpitations after exertion, shortness of breath, lymphadenopathy, signs of sepsis, nosebleeds, splenomegaly, joint pain, thrombocytosis, fever, weight loss","A myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is one of a group of cancers in which blood cells in the bone marrow do not mature, and as a result, do not develop into healthy blood cells. Early on, no symptoms typically are seen. Later, symptoms may include fatigue, shortness of breath, bleeding disorders, anemia, or frequent infections. Some types may develop into acute myeloid leukemia.
Risk factors include previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy, exposure to certain chemicals such as tobacco smoke, pesticides, and benzene, and exposure to heavy metals such as mercury or lead."
Orbital Liposarcoma,"Proptosis, visual impairment, optic disc edema, immobility of the eyeball, swelling of the eyelid with a pale green appearance, and a feeling of pressure within the eye","Liposarcomas are the most common subtype of soft tissue sarcomas, accounting for at least 20% of all sarcomas in adults. Soft tissue sarcomas are rare neoplasms with over 150 different histological subtypes or forms. Liposarcomas arise from the precursor lipoblasts of the adipocytes (i.e. fat cells) in adipose (i.e. fat) tissues."
Cervical Invasive Cancer,"Frequent urination, urgency of urination, pain during urination, even prolapse, hematuria, vaginal bleeding, shock","Cervical cancer is a cancer arising from the cervix or in any layer of the wall of the cervix. It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that can invade or spread to other parts of the body. Early on, typically no symptoms are seen. Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain or pain during sexual intercourse. While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer."
Urethral Agenesis and Congenital Urethral Atresia,"Chronic renal failure, urinary retention, urinary extravasation, difficulty urinating, and urine retention","Vaginoplasty is any surgical procedure that results in the construction or reconstruction of the vagina. It is a type of genitoplasty. Pelvic organ prolapse is often treated with one or more surgeries to repair the vagina. Sometimes a vaginoplasty is needed following the treatment or removal of malignant growths or abscesses to restore a normal vaginal structure and function. Surgery to the vagina is done to correct congenital defects to the vagina, urethra  and rectum."
Kaposi's Sarcoma,"Idiopathic, multifocal, pigmented sarcoma of the skin","Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a type of cancer that can form masses on the skin, in lymph nodes, in the mouth, or in other organs. The skin lesions are usually painless, purple and may be flat or raised. Lesions can occur singly, multiply in a limited area, or may be widespread. Depending on the sub-type of disease and level of immune suppression, KS may worsen either gradually or quickly. Except for classic KS where there is generally no immune suppression, KS is caused by a combination of immune suppression (such as due to HIV/AIDS) and infection by Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8  also called KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV))."
Acute Mesenteric Artery Ischemia,"Abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, diffuse periumbilical pain, fever, hypotension, abdominal distension, mental confusion, increased bowel sounds, abdominal muscle tension","Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome is a gastro-vascular disorder in which the third and final portion of the duodenum is compressed between the abdominal aorta (AA) and the overlying superior mesenteric artery.  This rare, potentially life-threatening syndrome is typically caused by an angle of 625 between the AA and the SMA, in comparison to the normal range of 3856, due to a lack of retroperitoneal and visceral fat (mesenteric fat). In addition, the aortomesenteric distance is 28 millimeters, as opposed to the typical 1020. However, a narrow SMA angle alone is not enough to make a diagnosis, because patients with a low BMI, most notably children, have been known to have a narrow SMA angle with no symptoms of SMA syndrome.
SMA syndrome is also known as Wilkie's syndrome, cast syndrome, mesenteric root syndrome, chronic duodenal ileus and intermittent arterio-mesenteric occlusion."
Endocrine Disorders,"Acne, menstrual irregularities, sleep disturbances, mental abnormalities, abnormal eating habits, abnormal gastric intake","Endocrine diseases are disorders of the endocrine system. The branch of medicine associated with endocrine disorders is known as endocrinology.


== Types of disease ==
Broadly speaking, endocrine disorders may be subdivided into three groups:

Endocrine gland hypofunction/hyposecretion (leading to hormone deficiency)
Endocrine gland hyperfunction/hypersecretion (leading to hormone excess)
Tumours (benign or malignant) of endocrine glands
Endocrine disorders are often quite complex, involving a mixed picture of hyposecretion and hypersecretion because of the feedback mechanisms involved in the endocrine system. For example, most forms of hyperthyroidism are associated with an excess of thyroid hormone and a low level of thyroid stimulating hormone.

Goiter,"Neck lump, irritability, excessive sweating, chest tightness, heart palpitations, menstrual irregularity","Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit a ball into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible.
Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not use a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game. Courses typically have either 9 or 18 holes, regions of terrain that each contain a cup, the hole that receives the ball. Each hole on a course has a teeing ground for the hole's first stroke, and a putting green containing the cup. There are several standard forms of terrain between the tee and the green, such as the fairway, rough (tall grass), and various hazards that may be water, rocks, or sand-filled bunkers."
Acinic Cell Carcinoma,"Lymph node enlargement, nodules","Small-cell carcinoma, also known as oat cell carcinoma, is a type of highly malignant cancer that most commonly arises within the lung, although it can occasionally arise in other body sites, such as the cervix, prostate, and gastrointestinal tract. Compared to non-small cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma is more aggressive, with a shorter doubling time, higher growth fraction, and earlier development of metastases.
Extensive stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is classified as a rare disorder. Ten-year relative survival rate (combined limited and extensive SCLC) is 3.5% (4.3% for women, 2.8% for men). Survival can be higher or lower based on a combination of factors including stage, age, sex and race."
Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR),"The uterus of the pregnant woman is significantly smaller than the gestational age, fetal survival, weak fetal movements, and growth retardation. Equivalent to fetal intrauterine growth retardation.","Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), or fetal growth restriction, is the poor growth of a fetus while in the womb during pregnancy. IUGR is defined by clinical features of malnutrition and evidence of reduced growth regardless of an infant's birth weight percentile. The causes of IUGR are broad and may involve maternal, fetal, or placental complications.
At least 60% of the 4 million neonatal deaths that occur worldwide every year are associated with low birth weight, caused by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm delivery, and genetic abnormalities, demonstrating that under-nutrition is already a leading health problem at birth.
Intrauterine growth restriction can result in a baby being small for gestational age (SGA), which is most commonly defined as a weight below the 10th percentile for the gestational age."
Gynecomastia,"Obesity, Enlarged Breasts, Increased Vocal Pitch","Gynecomastia (also spelled gynaecomastia) is the non-cancerous enlargement of one or both breasts in men due to the growth of breast tissue as a result of a hormone imbalance between estrogens and androgens. Physically speaking, gynecomastia is completely benign, but it is associated with significant psychological distress, social stigma, and dysphoria.
Gynecomastia can be normal in newborn male babies due to exposure to estrogen from the mother, in adolescent boys going through puberty, in older men over the age of 50, and in obese men. Most occurrences of gynecomastia do not require diagnostic tests. Gynecomastia may be caused by abnormal hormone changes, any condition that leads to an increase in the ratio of estrogens/androgens such as liver disease, kidney failure, thyroid disease and some non-breast tumors."
Ovarian Fibroma,"Abdominal pain, abdominal mass, ascites, pelvic heaviness, severe unilateral lower abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding","The ovarian fibroma, also fibroma, is a benign sex cord-stromal tumour.
Ovarian fibromas represent 4% of all ovarian neoplasms. They tend to occur mostly during perimenopause and postmenopause, the median age having been reported to be about 52 years, and they are rare in children. Lesions tend to be asymptomatic. If symptoms are present, the most common one is abdominal pain."
Pediatric Hypoglycemia,"Shock, profuse sweating, dizziness, pallor, and fatigue","Hypoglycemia (American English), also spelled hypoglycaemia or hypoglycmia (British English), sometimes called low blood sugar, is a fall in blood sugar to levels below normal, typically below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). Whipple's triad is used to properly identify hypoglycemic episodes. It is defined as blood glucose below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), symptoms associated with hypoglycemia, and resolution of symptoms when blood sugar returns to normal. Hypoglycemia may result in headache, tiredness, clumsiness, trouble talking, confusion, fast heart rate, sweating, shakiness, nervousness, hunger, loss of consciousness, seizures, or death. Symptoms typically come on quickly."
Pediatric Familial Recurrent Hematuria Syndrome,"Hematuria, Proteinuria, Hypertension","Hemolyticuremic syndrome (HUS) is a syndrome characterized by low red blood cells, acute kidney injury (previously called acute renal failure), and low platelets. Initial symptoms typically include bloody diarrhea, fever, vomiting, and weakness. Kidney problems and low platelets then occur as the diarrhea progresses. Children are more commonly affected, but most children recover without permanent damage to their health, although some children may have serious and sometimes life-threatening complications. Adults, especially the elderly, may show a more complicated presentation."
Cervical Sarcoma,"Vaginal bleeding, increased discharge, abdominal pain","A soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) is a malignant tumor, a type of cancer, that develops in soft tissue. A soft-tissue sarcoma is often a painless mass that grows slowly over months or years. They may be superficial or deep-seated. Any such unexplained mass must be diagnosed by biopsy. Treatment may include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted drug therapy."
Postmenopausal Ovarian Malignant Tumor,"Abdominal mass, abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding",Surface epithelial-stromal tumors are a class of ovarian neoplasms that may be benign or malignant. Neoplasms in this group are thought to be derived from the ovarian surface epithelium (modified peritoneum) or from ectopic endometrial or fallopian tube (tubal) tissue. Tumors of this type are also called ovarian adenocarcinoma. This group of tumors accounts for 90% to 95% of all cases of ovarian cancer; however is mainly only found in postmenopausal women with the exception of the United States where 7% of cases occur in women under the age of 40. Serum CA-125 is often elevated but is only 50% accurate so it is not a useful tumor marker to assess the progress of treatment.
Iridocorneal Endothelial Syndrome (ICE Syndrome),"Corneal edema, formation of grey-white tumor nodules on the surface of the iris, localized scleral swelling, headache, edema, eye pain, pain in the supraorbital arch, heterogeneous transparent vesicles on the cornea","Iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndromes are a spectrum of diseases characterized by slowly progressive abnormalities of the corneal endothelium and features including corneal edema, iris distortion, and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. ICE syndromes are predominantly unilateral and nonhereditary. The condition occurs in predominantly middle-aged women.Iridocorneal Endothelial (ICE) syndrome presents a unique set of challenges for both patients and ophthalmologists, and effective treatment of this group of rare  ocular diseases requires a combination of diagnostic and therapeutic complexity. It's important to understand. [1]


== Signs and symptoms ==
Many cases are asymptomatic, however patients many have decreased vision, glare, monocular diplopia or polyopia, and noticeable iris changes."
Cardiogenic Shock in the Elderly,"Oliguria, heart failure, generalized sweating, tachycardia, restlessness, pallor, arrhythmias, hypotension","Hypovolemic shock is a form of shock caused by severe hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume or extracellular fluid in the body). It can be caused by severe dehydration or blood loss. Hypovolemic shock is a medical emergency; if left untreated, the insufficient blood flow can cause damage to organs, leading to multiple organ failure.
In treating hypovolemic shock, it is important to determine the cause of the underlying hypovolemia, which may be the result of bleeding or other fluid losses. To minimize ischemic damage to tissues, treatment involves quickly replacing lost blood or fluids, with consideration of both rate and the type of fluids used."
Colonic Escherichia Coli Gastroenteritis,"Loss of appetite, diarrhea, fever, nausea and vomiting, dehydration, abdominal pain, hypokalemia, bloating, hypocalcemia, mucosal necrotizing ulcers, and abdominal discomfort","Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a serotype of the bacterial species Escherichia coli and is one of the Shiga-like toxinproducing types of E. coli. It is a cause of disease, typically foodborne illness, through consumption of contaminated and raw food, including raw milk and undercooked ground beef. Infection with this type of pathogenic bacteria may lead to hemorrhagic diarrhea, and to kidney failure; these have been reported to cause the deaths of children younger than five years of age, of elderly patients, and of patients whose immune systems are otherwise compromised.
Transmission is via the fecaloral route, and most illness has been through distribution of contaminated raw leaf green vegetables, undercooked meat and raw milk.


== Signs and symptoms ==
E. coli O157:H7 infection often causes severe, acute hemorrhagic diarrhea (although nonhemorrhagic diarrhea is also possible) and abdominal cramps."
Vulvar Metastatic Cancer,"Nodules, vulvar pain, frequent urination, painful urination, urinary retention, ulcers","Vulvar cancer is a cancer of the vulva, the outer portion of the female genitals. It most commonly affects the labia majora. Less often, the labia minora, clitoris, or Bartholin's glands are affected. Symptoms include a lump, itchiness, changes in the skin, or bleeding from the vulva.
Risk factors include vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), HPV infection, genital warts, smoking, and many sexual partners."
Guillain-Barr Syndrome,"Symmetrical weakness in legs, abnormal distal limb sensations such as burning, numbness, tingling, and discomfort, skin flushing, episodic facial flushing, increased sweating, tachycardia, swelling of hands and feet, and nutritional disorders.","GuillainBarr syndrome (GBS) is a rapid-onset muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. Typically, both sides of the body are involved, and the initial symptoms are changes in sensation or pain often in the back along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands, often spreading to the arms and upper body. The symptoms may develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening, with about 15% of people developing respiratory muscle weakness requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in the function of the autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure."
Waterhouse-Friderichsen Syndrome caused by Meningococcal Infection,"Keratosis pilaris, discoid erythema","WaterhouseFriderichsen syndrome (WFS) is defined as adrenal gland failure due to hemorrhages in the adrenal glands, commonly caused by sepsis. Typically, the bacteria responsible for triggering the bleeding is Neisseria meningitidis.
The bacterial infection leads to massive bleeding into one or both adrenal glands. Bilateral adrenal gland hemorrhaging is more common. It is characterized by overwhelming bacterial infection meningococcemia leading to massive blood invasion, organ failure, coma, low blood pressure and shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with widespread purpura, rapidly developing adrenocortical insufficiency and death."
Spinal Cord Ischemic Disease,"Intermittent claudication, weakness in the lower limbs, hyperactive tendon reflexes, sphincter dysfunction, paraplegia","Spinal cord stroke is a rare type of stroke with compromised blood flow to any region of spinal cord owing to occlusion or bleeding, leading to irreversible neuronal death. It can be classified into two types, ischaemia and haemorrhage, in which the former accounts for 86% of all cases, a pattern similar to cerebral stroke. The disease is either arisen spontaneously from aortic illnesses or postoperatively. It deprives patients of motor function or sensory function, and sometimes both. Infarction usually occurs in regions perfused by anterior spinal artery, which spans the anterior two-thirds of spinal cord."
Giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath,"Painless mass, skin lesion appears as round or oval nodules, hard in consistency","Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) is a non-malignant tumor defined histologically as inclusions of osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells, hemosiderin, and macrophages. This histology can present one of 2 clinically distinct ways. Localized/nodular TGCT (L-TGCT), sometimes referred to as giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath;:100 is a common tumor that presents as a slow-growing, encapsulated, localized and limited bump, most frequently in the fingers.  Diffuse TGCT (D-TGCT)  also called pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a rare tumor that presents as a proliferative, destructive, intra-articular lesion, most commonly in the knee.:102  D-TGCT tumors often develop from the lining of joints (also known as synovial tissue).:100:245. Common symptoms of D-TGCT include swelling, pain, stiffness and reduced mobility in the affected joint or limb.:102


== Classification ==
Classification for TGCT encompasses two subtypes that can be divided according to site  within a joint (intra-articular) or outside of the joint (extra-articular)  and growth pattern (localized or diffuse) of the tumor(s).:100:361 Localized and diffuse subsets of TGCT differ in their prognosis, clinical presentation, and biological behavior, but share a similar manner of disease development.:100

Localized TGCT is sometimes referred to as localized pigmented villonodular synovitis (L-PVNS), giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath (GCT-TS), nodular tenosynovitis, localized nodular tenosynovitis, and L-TGCT.:1:100
The localized form of TGCT is more common.:100:245 Localized TGCT tumors are typically 0.5 cm-4 cm),:101 develop over years,:100 are benign and non-destructive to the surrounding tissue, and may reoccur in the affected area.:101 The most common symptom is painless swelling.:101 Localized TGCT most often occurs in fingers, but can also occur in other joints."
Paraneoplastic Gastrointestinal Syndrome,"Villous atrophy, shock, diarrhea, increased gastrointestinal mucosal permeability, obstruction of gastrointestinal lymphatic drainage, lymphatic congestion, lymphatic rupture, hypoproteinemia, edema, dehydration","A paraneoplastic syndrome is a syndrome (a set of signs and symptoms) that is the consequence of a tumor in the body (usually a cancerous one). It is specifically due to the production of chemical signaling molecules (such as hormones or cytokines) by tumor cells or by an immune response against the tumor. Unlike a mass effect, it is not due to the local presence of cancer cells.
Paraneoplastic syndromes are typical among middle-aged to older people, and they most commonly occur with cancers of the lung, breast, ovaries or lymphatic system (a lymphoma). Sometimes, the symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes show before the diagnosis of a malignancy, which has been hypothesized to relate to the disease pathogenesis."
Summer-heat Syndrome,"Fatigue and lethargy, lack of strength and excessive sleepiness, dizziness and heavy sweating, irritability and thirst, dull appetite, and weight loss.","Hyperthermia, also known simply as overheating, is a condition in which an individual's body temperature is elevated beyond normal due to failed thermoregulation. The person's body produces or absorbs more heat than it dissipates. When extreme temperature elevation occurs, it becomes a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment to prevent disability or death. Almost half a million deaths are recorded every year from hyperthermia.
The most common causes include heat stroke and adverse reactions to drugs."
Early Stage Breast Cancer,"Nipple discharge, axillary lymph node enlargement, peau d'orange appearance of the skin, palpable mobile masses, mild pain and discomfort","Cancer staging is the process of determining the extent to which a cancer has  grown and spread. A number from I to IV is assigned, with I being an isolated cancer and IV being a cancer that has metastasized and spread from its origin. The stage generally takes into account the size of a tumor, whether it has invaded adjacent organs, how many regional (nearby) lymph nodes it has spread to (if any), and whether it has appeared in more distant locations (metastasized).


== TNM staging system ==

Cancer staging can be divided into a clinical stage and a pathologic stage. In the TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) system, clinical stage and pathologic stage are denoted by a small ""c"" or ""p"" before the stage (e.g., cT3N1M0 or pT2N0)."
Hereditary Dysfibrinogenemia,"Hemoptysis, menorrhagia, heteroprotein reaction","The dysfibrinogenemias consist of three types of fibrinogen disorders in which a critical blood clotting factor, fibrinogen, circulates at normal levels but is dysfunctional. Congenital dysfibrinogenemia is an inherited disorder in which one of the parental genes produces an abnormal fibrinogen. This fibrinogen interferes with normal blood clotting and/or lysis of blood clots. The condition therefore may cause pathological bleeding and/or thrombosis. Acquired dysfibrinogenemia is a non-hereditary disorder in which fibrinogen is dysfunctional due to the presence of liver disease, autoimmune disease, a plasma cell dyscrasias, or certain cancers."
Pediatric Pulmonary Edema,"Difficulty in breathing, cough, pallor, cyanosis, hypotension, hepatomegaly, faint heart sounds, coughing up sputum, rales","Negative-pressure pulmonary edema (NPPE), also known as Postobstructive Pulmonary Edema, is a clinical phenomenon that results from the generation of large negative pressures in the airways during attempted inspiration against some form of obstruction of the upper airways. The most common reported cause of NPPE reported in adults is laryngospasm, while the most implicated causes in children are infectious croup and epiglottitis. The large negative pressures created in the airways by inhalation against an upper airway obstruction can lead to fluid being drawn from blood vessels supplying the lungs into the alveoli, causing pulmonary edema and impaired ability for oxygen exchange (hypoxemia). The main treatment for NPPE is supportive care in an intensive care unit and can be fatal without intervention.


== Physiology ==
NPPE develops as a result of significant negative pressure generated in the chest cavity by inspiration against an upper airway obstruction."
March Hemoglobinuria,"Bacteriuria, back pain, low molecular weight proteinuria, asymptomatic bacteriuria, brown urine, heteroprotein reaction, anemia, hemoglobinuria, diabetes insipidus, hyperosmotic urine, specific aminoaciduria","Hemoglobinuria is a condition in which the oxygen transport protein hemoglobin is found in abnormally high concentrations in the urine. The condition is caused by excessive intravascular hemolysis, in which large numbers of red blood cells (RBCs) are destroyed, thereby releasing free hemoglobin into the plasma. Excess hemoglobin is filtered by the kidneys, which excrete it into the urine, giving urine a purple color. Hemoglobinuria can lead to acute tubular necrosis which is an uncommon cause of a death of uni-traumatic patients recovering in the ICU.


== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis is often made based on the medical history, blood samples, and a urine sample. The absence of urine RBCs and RBC casts microscopically despite a positive dipstick test suggests hemoglobinuria or myoglobinuria."
Acute Catarrhal Conjunctivitis,"The patient feels eye itchiness as if foreign bodies are present, and in severe cases, there may be eyelid heaviness, photophobia, tearing, and a burning sensation.","Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius (Hae) is a causative agent of acute and often purulent conjunctivitis, more commonly known as pink eye. It was discovered independently by Koch and Weeks in the 1880s.
During the mid-1980s to early 1990s, a highly virulent clonal group of Haemophilus aegyptius, localized in and around the So Paulo state of Brazil, was found to be responsible for Brazilian purpuric fever, an acute septicemic fulminant illness affecting children.


== History ==


=== Discovery and identification by Koch and Weeks ===
Haemophilus aegyptius was first observed by Koch in 1883. Under the German Cholera Commission of Egypt, Koch studied 50 patients in Egypt who were suffering from Egyptian eye disease."
Verruca Vulgaris,"Generally asymptomatic, occasional tenderness, semicircular or polygonal papules","Warts are non-cancerous viral growths usually occurring on the hands and feet but which can also affect other locations, such as the genitals or face. One or many warts may appear. They are distinguished from cancerous tumors as they are caused by a viral infection, such as a human papillomavirus,  rather than a cancer growth.
Factors that increase the risk include the use of public showers and pools, working with meat, eczema, and a weak immune system. The virus is believed to infect the host through the entrance of a skin wound."
Ovarian Serous Tumor,"Acute abdominal pain, ascites, abdominal distension, indigestion, difficulty in defecation, and urinary retention","Ovarian clear-cell carcinoma, or clear-cell carcinoma of the ovary, also called ovarian clear-cell adenocarcinoma, is one of several subtypes of ovarian carcinoma  a subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer, in contrast to non-epithelial cancers. According to research, most ovarian cancers start at the epithelial layer which is the lining of the ovary. Within this epithelial group ovarian clear-cell carcinoma makes up 510%. 
It was recognized as a separate category of ovarian cancer by the World Health Organization in 1973. Its incidence rate differs across various ethnic groups."
Kasabach-Merritt Syndrome (KMS),"Petechiae, purpura, epistaxis, and vascular malformations","KasabachMerritt syndrome (KMS), also known as hemangioma with thrombocytopenia, is a rare disease, usually of infants, in which a vascular tumor leads to decreased platelet counts and sometimes other bleeding problems, which can be life-threatening.  It is also known as hemangioma thrombocytopenia syndrome. It is named after Haig Haigouni Kasabach and Katharine Krom Merritt, the two pediatricians who first described the condition in 1940.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Initially a vascular lesion is usually noted on the skin which can be firm and hard (indurated). Areas of tiny red dots (petechiae) can appear around the lesion or on other parts of the body."
Cervical Polyp,"Yellow or blood-stained odorous vaginal discharge, postmenopausal bleeding","A cervical polyp is a common benign polyp or tumour on the surface of the cervical canal. They can cause irregular menstrual bleeding but often show no symptoms. Treatment consists of simple removal of the polyp and prognosis is generally good. About 1% of cervical polyps will show neoplastic change which may lead to cancer. They are most common in post-menarche, pre-menopausal women who have been pregnant."
Brucella Pneumonia,"Cough, expectoration, chest pain, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, shock, undulant fever, irregular fever, high fever, chills, shivering, restlessness","Brucella intermedia is a bacterium from the genus of Brucella.  It was first described by Velasco and others in 1998. It causes diseases in humans only rarely, with single case reports of cholangitis following liver transplantation, bacteremia in a patient with bladder cancer, a pelvic abscess after abdominal surgery, dyspepsia, endophthalmitis in the presence of a foreign body, pneumonia, and endocarditis.
B. intermedia, B. anthropi, and Brucella melitensis can be distinguished on the basis of a multi-primer polymerase chain reaction that targets the recA gene. A genome of B. intermedia was sequenced and submitted to GenBank in 2013."
Congenital Short Esophagus,"Symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease, cough, esophageal lumen obstruction, impression formation on the left wall of the esophagus, esophageal lumen stenosis, difficulty swallowing when extending the neck, abnormal breathing, vomiting blood and melena, fistula between the airway and esophagus, bloody stools, esophageal obstruction","Barrett's esophagus is a condition in which there is an abnormal (metaplastic) change in the mucosal cells that line the lower part of the esophagus. The cells change from stratified squamous epithelium to simple columnar epithelium, interspersed with goblet cells that are normally only found in the small intestine and large intestine. This change is considered to be a premalignant condition because of its potential to transition into esophageal adenocarcinoma, an often-deadly cancer.
The main cause of Barrett's esophagus is tissue adaptation to chronic acid exposure caused by reflux from the stomach. Barrett's esophagus is diagnosed by endoscopy to visually observe the lower esophagus, followed by a biopsy of the affected area and microscopic examination of that tissue."
Cerebral Venous Thrombosis,"High fever with chills, fatigue, malaise, muscle soreness, paralysis, ataxia, local venous tenderness, hypercoagulable state","Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis or cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), is the presence of a blood clot in the dural venous sinuses (which drain blood from the brain), the cerebral veins, or both. Symptoms may include severe headache, visual symptoms, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs on one side of the body, and seizures, which occur in around 40% of patients.
The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses. After confirmation of the diagnosis, investigations may be performed to determine the underlying cause, especially if one is not readily apparent.
Treatment is typically with anticoagulants (medications that suppress blood clotting) such as low molecular weight heparin."
Plasma Cell Mastitis,"Local breast pain and discomfort, palpable mass, frequent edema of the nipple, and often a powdery scab-like substance exuded from the nipple","Duct ectasia of the breast, mammary duct ectasia or plasma cell mastitis is a condition that occurs when a milk duct beneath the nipple widens, the duct walls thicken, and the duct fills with fluid. This is the most common cause of greenish discharge.
Mammary duct ectasia can mimic breast cancer. It is a disorder of peri- or post-menopausal age.
Duct ectasia syndrome is a synonym for nonpuerperal mastitis, but the term has also been occasionally used to describe special cases of fibrocystic diseases or mastalgia or as a wastebasket definition of benign breast disease."
Lung Tumor,"Difficulty in breathing, foul-smelling sputum, fever, cough, expectoration, hemoptysis","Lung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma, is a malignant tumor that begins in the lung. Lung cancer is caused by genetic damage to the DNA of cells in the airways, often caused by cigarette smoking or inhaling damaging chemicals. Damaged airway cells gain the ability to multiply unchecked, causing the growth of a tumor. Without treatment, tumors spread throughout the lung, damaging lung function. Eventually lung tumors metastasize, spreading to other parts of the body."
Neurogenic Bladder,"Significant decrease or loss of bladder sensation (urge to urinate, bladder distension)","Neurogenic bladder dysfunction, often called by the shortened term neurogenic bladder, refers to urinary bladder problems due to disease or injury of the central nervous system or peripheral nerves involved in the control of urination. There are multiple types of neurogenic bladder depending on the underlying cause and the symptoms. Symptoms include overactive bladder, urinary urgency, frequency, incontinence or difficulty passing urine. A range of diseases or conditions can cause neurogenic bladder including spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, stroke, brain injury, spina bifida, peripheral nerve damage, Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy or other neurodegenerative diseases. Neurogenic bladder can be diagnosed through a history and physical as well as imaging and more specialized testing."
Eyelid Malignant Melanoma,"Pigmentation abnormalities, pigmentary deposition and reduction, nodules","Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer; it develops from the  melanin-producing cells known as melanocytes. It typically occurs in the skin, but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye (uveal melanoma). In very rare cases melanoma can also happen in the lung which is known as primary pulmonary melanoma and only happens in 0.01% of primary lung tumors.
In women, melanomas most commonly occur on the legs; while in men, on the back. Melanoma is frequently referred to as malignant melanoma."
Breast Sarcoma,"Breast lump, breast swelling","A sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that arises from cells of mesenchymal origin. Originating from mesenchymal cells means that sarcomas are cancers of connective tissues such as bone, cartilage, muscle, fat, or vascular tissues. 
Sarcomas are one of five different types of cancer, classified by the cell type from which they originate. While there are five types under this category, sarcomas are most frequently contrasted with carcinomas which are much more common. Sarcomas are quite rare, making up about 1% of all adult cancer diagnoses and 15% of childhood cancer diagnoses."
Carotid Artery Traumatic Thrombosis,"Hematoma formation, transient cerebral ischemia, abrasion or swelling in the neck area, limb paralysis, hemiplegia, microthrombosis formation, dizziness, syncope, coma, confused state of consciousness","Vertebral artery dissection (VAD) is a flap-like tear of the inner lining of the vertebral artery, which is located in the neck and supplies blood to the brain. After the tear, blood enters the arterial wall and forms a blood clot, thickening the artery wall and often impeding blood flow. The symptoms of vertebral artery dissection include head and neck pain and intermittent or permanent stroke symptoms such as difficulty speaking, impaired coordination, and visual loss. It is usually diagnosed with a contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan.
Vertebral dissection may occur after physical trauma to the neck, such as a blunt injury (e.g."
Pylephlebitis,"Hepatomegaly, pain in the liver area, relapsing fever, chills, jaundice, abdominal muscle tension, abdominal distension, hematemesis and melena, diarrhea","Pylephlebitis is an uncommon thrombophlebitis of the portal vein or any of its branches (i.e. a portal vein thrombosis) that is caused by infection. It is usually a complication of intra-abdominal sepsis, most often following diverticulitis, perforated appendicitis, or peritonitis. Considered uniformly lethal in the pre-antibiotic era, it still carries a mortality of 10-30%.


== Presentation ==
It typically presents with fever, rigors, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, but sometimes abdominal pain may be absent."
Thymoma,"Chest pain, chest tightness, cough, pre-sternal oppressive pain, dyspnea, pericardial effusion, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, mediastinal shadow, retrosternal pain, diaphragmatic paralysis, fatigue, night sweats","A thymoma is a tumor originating from the epithelial cells of the thymus that is considered a rare neoplasm. Thymomas are frequently associated with neuromuscular disorders such as  myasthenia gravis; thymoma is found in 20% of patients with myasthenia gravis. Once diagnosed, thymomas may be removed surgically. In the rare case of a malignant tumor, chemotherapy may be used.


== Signs and symptoms ==
A third of all people with a thymoma have symptoms caused by compression of the surrounding organs by an expansive mass."
Osteosarcoma of Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma,"Flexural deformities, joint pain in hips, knees, and elbows","A sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that arises from cells of mesenchymal origin. Originating from mesenchymal cells means that sarcomas are cancers of connective tissues such as bone, cartilage, muscle, fat, or vascular tissues. 
Sarcomas are one of five different types of cancer, classified by the cell type from which they originate. While there are five types under this category, sarcomas are most frequently contrasted with carcinomas which are much more common. Sarcomas are quite rare, making up about 1% of all adult cancer diagnoses and 15% of childhood cancer diagnoses."
Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome,"Breast lumps, breast hardening, breast tenderness, breast redness and warmth, fibrocystic breast changes, occult breast pain, breast enlargement","Hereditary breastovarian cancer syndromes (HBOC) are cancer syndromes that produce higher than normal levels of breast cancer, ovarian cancer and additional cancers in genetically related families (either one individual had both, or several individuals in the pedigree had one or the other disease). It accounts for 90% of the hereditary cancers. The hereditary factors may be proven or suspected to cause the pattern of breast and ovarian cancer occurrences in the family. The name HBOC may be misleading because it implies that this genetic susceptibility to cancer is mainly in women. In reality, both sexes have the same rates of gene mutations and HBOC can predispose to other cancers including prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer."
Pyonephrosis,"Lumbar pain, hematuria, proteinuria, urinary frequency, urinary urgency, dysuria","Pyonephrosis (from Greek  pyon 'pus' and  nephros 'kidney') is a dangerous kidney infection that is characterized by pus accumulation in the renal collecting system. It is linked to renal collecting system blockage and suppurative renal parenchymal destruction, which result in complete or nearly complete kidney failure.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Clinical symptoms in patients with pyonephrosis can range from frank sepsis (15%) to asymptomatic bacteriuria. Upon physical examination, the hydronephrotic kidney may be linked to a palpable abdominal mass. On rare occasions, the hydronephrotic kidney infection may burst spontaneously into the peritoneal cavity, resulting in diffuse peritonitis and sepsis in certain patients."
Sporadic Goiter,"Pain, difficulty breathing, coughing, difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, facial edema","A goitre (British English), or goiter (American English), is a swelling in the neck resulting from an enlarged thyroid gland. A goitre can be associated with a thyroid that is not functioning properly.
Worldwide, over 90% of goitre cases are caused by iodine deficiency. The term is from the Latin gutturia, meaning throat. Most goitres are not cancerous (benign), though they may be potentially harmful."
Choriocarcinoma,Irregular vaginal bleeding,"Choriocarcinoma is a trophoblastic cancer usually located on the placenta. It is characterized by early hematogenous spread to the lungs. It belongs to the malignant end of the spectrum in gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). It is also classified as a germ cell tumor and may arise in the testis or ovary.


== Signs and symptoms ==
increased quantitative chorionic gonadotropin (the ""pregnancy hormone"") levels
vaginal bleeding
shortness of breath
hemoptysis (coughing up blood)
chest pain
chest X-ray shows multiple infiltrates of various shapes in both lungs
presents in males as a testicular cancer, sometimes with skin hyperpigmentation (from excess chorionic gonadotropin cross-reacting with the alpha MSH receptor), gynecomastia, and weight loss (from excess chorionic gonadotropin cross-reacting with the LH, FSH, and TSH receptor) in males
can present with decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) due to hyperthyroidism."
Pediatric Pneumonia,"Runny nose, sneezing, fever in children, coughing in children, dry cough, fever, rhonchi, edema of the bronchial mucosa, respiratory acidosis, metabolic acidosis, systemic infection and toxemia symptoms, indentation sign","Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) refers to pneumonia (any of several lung diseases) contracted by a person outside of the healthcare system. In contrast, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is seen in patients who have recently visited a hospital or who live in long-term care facilities. CAP is common, affecting people of all ages, and its symptoms occur as a result of oxygen-absorbing areas of the lung (alveoli) filling with fluid. This inhibits lung function, causing dyspnea, fever, chest pains and cough.
CAP, the most common type of pneumonia, is a leading cause of illness and death worldwide."
Mucopolysaccharidosis Type VII,"Shortly after birth, characteristic facial features, hepatosplenomegaly, and growth retardation occur, followed by recurrent respiratory infections, sluggish response, kyphosis, and other deformities.","Sly syndrome, also called mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS-VII), is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency of the enzyme -glucuronidase. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (AKA GAGs, or mucopolysaccharides). The inability to break down GAGs leads to a buildup in many tissues and organs of the body. The severity of the disease can vary widely.


== Signs and symptoms ==
The most severe cases of Sly syndrome can result in hydrops fetalis, which results in fetal death or death soon after birth."
Sepsis,"High fever, vomiting, skin petechiae, bruises, lethargy, coma","Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
This initial stage of sepsis is followed by suppression of the immune system. Common signs and symptoms include fever, increased heart rate, increased breathing rate, and confusion. There may also be symptoms related to a specific infection, such as a cough with pneumonia, or painful urination with a kidney infection. The very young, old, and people with a weakened immune system may not have any symptoms that are specific to their infection, and their body temperature may be low or normal instead of constituting a fever."
Staphylococcus Epidermidis Pneumonia,"Fever, cough, expectoration, rales, hemoptysis, pulmonary infection, septicemia, meningeal irritation signs","Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive spherically shaped bacterium, a member of the Bacillota, and is a usual member of the microbiota of the body, frequently found in the upper respiratory tract and on the skin. It is often positive for catalase and nitrate reduction and is a facultative anaerobe, meaning that it can grow without oxygen. Although S. aureus usually acts as a commensal of the human microbiota, it can also become an opportunistic pathogen, being a common cause of skin infections including abscesses, respiratory infections such as sinusitis, and food poisoning. Pathogenic strains often promote infections by producing virulence factors such as potent protein toxins, and the expression of a cell-surface protein that binds and inactivates antibodies. S. aureus is one of the leading pathogens for deaths associated with antimicrobial resistance and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains, such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)."
Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia in Elderly,"Increased nocturia, urinary incontinence and dribbling, difficulty in urination and urinary retention, thinning or interruption of urine stream, hematuria, bladder stones, and increased frequency of urination","Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also called prostate enlargement, is a noncancerous increase in size of the prostate gland. Symptoms may include frequent urination, trouble starting to urinate, weak stream, inability to urinate, or loss of bladder control. Complications can include urinary tract infections, bladder stones, and chronic kidney problems.
The cause is unclear. Risk factors include a family history, obesity, type 2 diabetes, not enough exercise, and erectile dysfunction."
Retroperitoneal hematoma,"Mild abdominal pain, abdominal distension, back pain, diminished bowel sounds, severe cases may be accompanied by shock","Retroperitoneal bleeding is an accumulation of blood in the retroperitoneal space. Signs and symptoms may include abdominal or upper leg pain, hematuria, and shock. It can be caused by major trauma or by non-traumatic mechanisms.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms may include:

abdominal pain.
upper leg pain."
Renal Tumor,"Pain in the lumbar and back region, hematuria, abdominal mass","Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a kidney cancer that originates in the lining of the proximal convoluted tubule, a part of the very small tubes in the kidney that transport primary urine. RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, responsible for approximately 9095% of cases. It is more common in men (with a male-to-female ratio of up to 2:1). It is most commonly diagnosed in the elderly (especially in people over 75 years of age).
Initial treatment is most commonly either partial or complete removal of the affected kidney(s)."
Idiopathic Calcinosis Cutis,"Hard subcutaneous nodules near large joints, skin lesions appearing as hard white papules.","Calcinosis cutis is an uncommon condition marked by calcium buildup in the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Calcinosis cutis can range in intensity from little nodules in one area of the body to huge, crippling lesions affecting a vast portion of the body. Five kinds of the condition are typically distinguished: calciphylaxis, idiopathic calcification, iatrogenic calcification, dystrophic calcification, and metastatic calcification.
Tumors, inflammation, varicose veins, infections, connective tissue disease, hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalcemia can all lead to calcinosis. Systemic sclerosis is linked to calcineuris cutis."
Leiomyoma,"Common in the lumbar area, with a diameter of several centimeters, and often has follicular papules on the surface.","A leiomyoma, also known as a fibroid, is a benign smooth muscle tumor that very rarely becomes cancer (0.1%). They can occur in any organ, but the most common forms occur in the uterus, small bowel, and the esophagus. Polycythemia may occur due to increased erythropoietin production as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome.
The word is from leio- + myo- + -oma, 'smooth-muscle tumor'. The plural form can be either the English leiomyomas or the classical leiomyomata."
Tachycardia-induced Cardiomyopathy,"Arrhythmias, palpitations, shock, tachycardia, syncope, cardiac enlargement, chest tightness, chronic atrial fibrillation","Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy (TIC) is a disease where prolonged tachycardia (a fast heart rate) or arrhythmia (an irregular heart rhythm) causes an impairment of the myocardium (heart muscle), which can result in heart failure. People with TIC may have symptoms associated with heart failure (e.g. shortness of breath or ankle swelling) or symptoms related to the tachycardia or arrhythmia (e.g. palpitations). Though atrial fibrillation is the most common cause of TIC, several tachycardias and arrhythmias have been associated with the disease."
Hypernatremia,"Fatigue, headache, irritability, tremors, convulsions, difficulty breathing, cough","Hyponatremia or hyponatraemia is a low concentration of sodium in the blood. It is generally defined as a sodium concentration of less than 135 mmol/L (135 mEq/L), with severe hyponatremia being below 120 mEq/L. Symptoms can be absent, mild or severe. Mild symptoms include a decreased ability to think, headaches, nausea, and poor balance. Severe symptoms include confusion, seizures, and coma; death can ensue.
The causes of hyponatremia are typically classified by a person's body fluid status into low volume, normal volume, or high volume."
Respiratory Failure,"Difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, cyanosis, disturbance of consciousness","Respiratory failure results from inadequate gas exchange by the respiratory system, meaning that the arterial oxygen, carbon dioxide, or both cannot be kept at normal levels. A drop in the oxygen carried in the blood is known as hypoxemia; a rise in arterial carbon dioxide levels is called hypercapnia. Respiratory failure is classified as either Type 1 or Type 2, based on whether there is a high carbon dioxide level, and can be acute or chronic. In clinical trials, the definition of respiratory failure usually includes increased respiratory rate, abnormal blood gases (hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or both), and evidence of increased work of breathing. Respiratory failure causes an altered state of consciousness due to ischemia in the brain."
Pulmonary Vasculitis,"Fever, fatigue, joint pain, difficulty breathing, hemoptysis, chest pain, myalgia, dizziness, dementia, pulselessness, abdominal pain, left heart failure","Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), after Nazi German physician Friedrich Wegener, is a rare, long-term, systemic disorder that involves the formation of granulomas and inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis). It is an autoimmune disease and a form of vasculitis that affects small- and medium-sized vessels in many organs, but most commonly affects the upper respiratory tract, lungs, and kidneys. The signs and symptoms of GPA are highly varied and reflect which organs are supplied by the affected blood vessels. Typical signs and symptoms include nosebleeds, stuffy nose and crustiness of nasal secretions, and inflammation of the uveal layer of the eye.  Damage to the heart, lungs, and kidneys can be fatal."
Esophageal Carcinoid,"Discomfort or choking sensation behind the sternum when swallowing, diarrhea, choking sensation, dysphagia, facial flushing, wheezing, edema","Esophageal cancer (American English) or oesophageal cancer (British English) is cancer arising from the esophagusthe food pipe that runs between the throat and the stomach. Symptoms often include difficulty in swallowing and weight loss. Other symptoms may include pain when swallowing, a hoarse voice, enlarged lymph nodes (""glands"") around the collarbone, a dry cough, and possibly coughing up or vomiting blood.
The two main sub-types of the disease are esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (often abbreviated to ESCC), which is more common in the developing world, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which is more common in the developed world. A number of less common types also occur."
Atlantoaxial Dislocation,"Pain in the neck and occipital region, limited movement, stiffness, weakness and numbness in limbs, unsteady gait, incontinence, and difficulty in breathing","Atlanto-occipital dislocation, orthopedic decapitation, or internal decapitation describes ligamentous separation of the spinal column from the skull base. It is possible for a human to survive such an injury; however, 70% of cases result in immediate death. It should not be confused with atlanto-axial dislocation, which describes ligamentous separation between the first and second cervical vertebra.


== Mechanism ==
The injury is a result of disruption of the stabilizing ligaments between the occiput, or posterior skull base, and the C1 vertebral body, otherwise known as the atlas. The diagnosis is usually suspected by history and physical exam, but confirmed by imaging, typically by CT due to its faster speed in the acute trauma setting, although MRI can also help with assessment in equivocal cases."
Xanthogranulomatous Pyelonephritis,"Complicated urinary tract infection, fever, fatigue, weight loss, irregular fever, ureteral obstruction, flank pain, anorexia, constipation, urinary stones","Pyelonephritis  is inflammation of the kidney, typically due to a bacterial infection. Symptoms most often include fever and flank tenderness. Other symptoms may include nausea, burning with urination, and frequent urination. Complications may include pus around the kidney, sepsis, or kidney failure.
It is typically due to a bacterial infection, most commonly Escherichia coli."
Central Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors,"Headache, vomiting, convulsions, unsteady gait","Primitive neuroectodermal tumor is a malignant (cancerous) neural crest tumor. It is a rare tumor, usually occurring in children and young adults under 25 years of age. The overall 5 year survival rate is about 53%.
It gets its name because the majority of the cells in the tumor are derived from neuroectoderm, but have not developed and differentiated in the way a normal neuron would, and so the cells appear ""primitive"". PNET belongs to the Ewing family of tumors."
Choroidal Neovascularization,"Edema, visual impairment, metamorphopsia, fundus hemorrhage and exudation, retinal detachment","Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the creation of new blood vessels in the choroid layer of the eye. Choroidal neovascularization is a common cause of neovascular degenerative maculopathy (i.e. 'wet' macular degeneration) commonly exacerbated by extreme myopia, malignant myopic degeneration, or age-related developments.


== Causes ==
CNV can occur rapidly in individuals with defects in Bruch's membrane, the innermost layer of the choroid. It is also associated with excessive amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)."
Delayed Hypogammaglobulinemia,"Malignant anemia, neutropenia, rheumatoid arthritis, splenomegaly","Hypogammaglobulinemia is an immune system disorder in which not enough gamma globulins are produced in the blood (thus hypo- + gamma + globulin + -emia). This results in a lower antibody count, which impairs the immune system, increasing risk of infection. Hypogammaglobulinemia may result from a variety of primary genetic immune system defects, such as common variable immunodeficiency, or it may be caused by secondary effects such as medication, blood cancer, or poor nutrition, or loss of gamma globulins in urine, as in nonselective glomerular proteinuria.  Patients with hypogammaglobulinemia have reduced immune function; important considerations include avoiding use of live vaccines, and take precautionary measures when traveling to regions with endemic disease or poor sanitation such as receiving immunizations, taking antibiotics abroad, drinking only safe or boiled water, arranging appropriate medical cover in advance of travel, and ensuring continuation of any immunoglobulin infusions needed.


== Types ==
The following lists types of ""agammaglobulinemia"" catalogued in the OMIM. Hypogammaglobulinemia can have other types; see sections ""Causes"" and ""Etymology"" below."
Orbital Fibrosarcoma,"Proptosis (eye bulging), eye swelling, inability to move the eyeball voluntarily, eye pain, periorbital halo, swollen eyelids with a pale greenish appearance, dazzle, changes in vision and visual fields, limitation in upward gaze, visual disturbances, increase in hyperopic refractive error, and inability for downward gaze","Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare neoplasm of the mesodermal cells that form the connective tissues which support virtually all of the organs and tissues of the body. IMT was formerly termed inflammatory pseudotumor. Currently, however, inflammatory pseudotumor designates a large and heterogeneous group of soft tissue tumors that includes inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, plasma cell granuloma, xanthomatous pseudotumor, solitary mast cell granuloma, inflammatory fibrosarcoma, pseudosarcomatous myofibroblastic proliferation, myofibroblastoma, inflammatory myofibrohistiocytic proliferation, and other tumors that develop from connective tissue cells. Inflammatory pseudotumour is a generic term applied to various neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissue lesions which share a common microscopic appearance consisting of spindle cells and a prominent presence of the white blood cells that populate chronic or, less commonly, acute inflamed tissues.
Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor was initially regarded as a benign tumor that most often developed in the lung and less commonly in almost any organ system or tissue."
Acute Renal Failure,"Increased blood pressure, dizziness, headache, anemia, oliguria, edema","Acute kidney injury (AKI), previously called acute renal failure (ARF), is a sudden decrease in kidney function that develops within seven days, as shown by an increase in serum creatinine or a decrease in urine output, or both.
Causes of AKI are classified as either prerenal (due to decreased blood flow to the kidney), intrinsic renal (due to damage to the kidney itself), or postrenal (due to blockage of urine flow). Prerenal causes of AKI include sepsis, dehydration, excessive blood loss, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, cirrhosis, and certain medications like ACE inhibitors or NSAIDs. Intrinsic renal causes of AKI include glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, certain antibiotics, and chemotherapeutic agents. Postrenal causes of AKI include kidney stones, bladder cancer, neurogenic bladder, enlargement of the prostate, narrowing of the urethra, and certain medications like anticholinergics."
Central Nervous System Leukemia (CNS-L),"Vomiting, headache, neck stiffness, papilledema, thrombocytopenia, coagulation disorders, intracranial hemorrhage, restlessness, confusion, seizures, hemiparesis, increased intracranial pressure","Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a cancer of the lymphoid line of blood cells characterized by the development of large numbers of immature lymphocytes. Symptoms may include feeling tired, pale skin color, fever, easy bleeding or bruising, enlarged lymph nodes, or bone pain. As an acute leukemia, ALL progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.
In most cases, the cause is unknown. Genetic risk factors may include Down syndrome, LiFraumeni syndrome, or neurofibromatosis type 1."
Mediastinal Neurogenic Tumors,"Mediastinal cysts, mediastinal lesions, severe pain, tumor traction, mediastinal widening, cough, tracheal and mediastinal displacement, superior vena cava obstruction","A mediastinal tumor is a tumor in the mediastinum, the cavity that separates the lungs from the rest of the chest. It contains the heart, esophagus, trachea, thymus, and aorta. The most common mediastinal masses are thymoma (20% of mediastinal tumors), usually found in the anterior mediastinum, followed by neurogenic Timor (1520%) located in the anterior mediastinum. Lung cancer typically spreads to the lymph nodes in the mediastinum.
The mediastinum has three main  parts: the anterior mediastinum (front), the middle mediastinum, and the posterior mediastinum (back)."
Extraskeletal Osteosarcoma,"Pain, joint swelling, tenderness","An osteosarcoma (OS) or osteogenic sarcoma (OGS) is a cancerous tumor in a bone. Specifically, it is an aggressive malignant neoplasm that arises from primitive transformed cells of mesenchymal origin (and thus a sarcoma) and that exhibits osteoblastic differentiation and produces malignant osteoid.
Osteosarcoma is the most common histological form of primary bone sarcoma. It is most prevalent in teenagers and young adults.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Many patients first complain of pain that may be worse at night, may be intermittent and of varying intensity and may have been occurring for a long time."
Thymic Carcinoma,"Chest pain, night sweats, coughing, facial edema, lymphadenopathy, hemoptysis, fatigue","Thymic carcinoma, or type C thymoma, is a malignancy of the thymus. It is a rare cancer that is often diagnosed at advanced stages. Recurrence following treatment is common, and thymic carcinoma is associated with a poor prognosis.


== Epidemiology ==
A study examining cases of thymic carcinoma in the United States from 2001 to 2015 found a peak incidence from 70 to 74 years old and a higher incidence in males compared to females. After thymoma, thymic carcinoma is the second most common type of thymus cancer."
Neurofibromatosis,"Presents with intellectual decline, memory disorders, epileptic seizures, limb weakness, numbness, and skin pigmentation spots, which appear light brown, dark brown, or coffee-colored","Neurofibromatosis (NF) refers to a group of three distinct genetic conditions in which tumors grow in the nervous system. The tumors are non-cancerous (benign) and often involve the skin or surrounding bone. Although symptoms are often mild, each condition presents differently. Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is typically characterized by caf au lait spots (light-brown flat patches of skin), neurofibromas (small bumps in or under the skin), scoliosis (side-way curvature of the back), and headaches. Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2), on the other hand, may present with early-onset hearing loss, cataracts, tinnitus, difficulty walking or maintaining balance, and muscle atrophy."
Multiple Intracranial Hematoma,"Headache, vomiting, fever, persistent coma, consciousness disorder","A blunt trauma, also known as a blunt force trauma or non-penetrating trauma, is a physical trauma due to a forceful impact without penetration of the body's surface. Blunt trauma stands in contrast with penetrating trauma, which occurs when an object pierces the skin, enters body tissue, and creates an open wound. Blunt trauma occurs due to direct physical trauma or impactful force to a body part. Such incidents often occur with road traffic collisions, assaults, and sports-related injuries, and are notably common among the elderly who experience falls.
Blunt trauma can lead to a wide range of injuries including contusions, concussions, abrasions, lacerations, internal or external hemorrhages, and bone fractures."
Pediatric Virus-Associated Hemophagocytic Syndrome,"High fever, papules, night sweats, fever, weight loss","In hematology, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), also known as haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (British spelling), and hemophagocytic or haemophagocytic syndrome, is an uncommon hematologic disorder seen more often in children than in adults. It is a life-threatening disease of severe hyperinflammation caused by uncontrolled proliferation of benign lymphocytes and macrophages that secrete high amounts of inflammatory cytokines. It is classified as one of the cytokine storm syndromes. There are inherited and non-inherited (acquired) causes of HLH.


== Signs and symptoms ==
HLH as defined by the HLH-04 criteria is a descriptive diagnosis. Its components are non-specific."
Platelet Coagulation Dysfunction,"Uncontrollable bleeding after tooth extraction, heavy menstrual bleeding, postpartum hemorrhage, hematoma formation","Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a condition in which blood clots form throughout the body, blocking small blood vessels. Symptoms may include chest pain, shortness of breath, leg pain, problems speaking, or problems moving parts of the body. As clotting factors and platelets are used up, bleeding may occur. This may include blood in the urine, blood in the stool, or bleeding into the skin. Complications may include organ failure."
Pediatric Heart Failure,"Tachypnea, tachycardia, cardiac enlargement, restlessness, somnolence, fatigue, dyspnea, decreased appetite, ventricular hypertrophy, microcirculation disorder, malnutrition, cyanosis","Cardiology (from Ancient Greek   (kardi) 'heart' and  - (-logia) 'study') is the study of the heart. Cardiology is a branch of medicine that deals with disorders of the heart and the cardiovascular system. The field includes medical diagnosis and treatment of congenital heart defects, coronary artery disease, heart failure, valvular heart disease, and electrophysiology. Physicians who specialize in this field of medicine are called cardiologists, a sub-specialty of internal medicine. Pediatric cardiologists are pediatricians who specialize in cardiology."
Mysophobia,"Obsession with cleanliness, Fear","Nosophobia, also known as disease phobia or illness anxiety disorder, is the irrational fear of contracting a disease, a type of specific phobia. Primary fears of this kind are fear of contracting HIV infection (AIDS phobia or HIV serophobia), pulmonary tuberculosis (phthisiophobia), sexually transmitted infections (syphilophobia or venereophobia), cancer (carcinophobia), heart diseases (cardiophobia), COVID-19 (coronaphobia), and catching the common cold or flu.
The word nosophobia comes from the Greek  nosos for ""disease"" and , phobos, ""fear"".


== Signs and symptoms ==
Nosophobia is listed under hypochondriacal disorders by the ICD-10, which are defined by having a persistent preoccupation with the possibility of having at least one serious and progressive physical disorders. Nosophobia is described as unfounded."
Familial Dysbetalipoproteinemia,"Lipid deposition diseases, small yellowish papular eruptions","Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia or type III hyperlipoproteinemia is a condition characterized by increased total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and decreased HDL levels.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs of familial dysbetaproteinemia include xanthoma striatum palmare (orange or yellow discoloration of the palms) and tuberoeruptive xanthomas over the elbows and knees. The disease leads to premature atherosclerosis and therefore a possible early onset of coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease leading to a heart attack, i.e. myocardial infarction, chest pain on exercise, i.e. angina pectoris or stroke in young adults or middle aged patients."
Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency,"Fatigue, weight loss, abnormal pigmentation, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension, decreased libido, dizziness, blurred vision, somnolence","Adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce adequate amounts of steroid hormones. The adrenal glandsalso referred to as the adrenal cortexnormally secrete glucocorticoids (primarily cortisol), mineralocorticoids (primarily aldosterone), and androgens. These hormones are important in regulating blood pressure, electrolytes, and metabolism as a whole. Deficiency of these hormones leads to symptoms ranging from abdominal pain, vomiting, muscle weakness and fatigue, low blood pressure, depression, mood and personality changes (in mild cases) to organ failure and shock (in severe cases). Adrenal crisis may occur if a person having adrenal insufficiency experiences stresses, such as an accident, injury, surgery, or severe infection; this is a life-threatening medical condition resulting from severe deficiency of cortisol in the body."
Vulvar Crohn's Disease,"Vulvar swelling, vulvar tenderness, vulvar ulcers, fever, abdominal pain, erythema multiforme-like rash, abdominal distension, perineal fistulas or sinus tracts, abdominal mass, vulvar itching, diarrhea","Crohn's disease (CD) of the vulva  is a rare extra intestinal condition, with granulomatous cutaneous lesions affecting the female genitalia. Lesions connected to the affected gut via a healthy tissue are referred to as metastatic lesions.


== Presentation ==
The most common clinical manifestation of vulvar CD is unilateral labial swelling associated with chronic vulvar ulceration, along with perianal lesions which were reported in 48% of the patients.
Dermatologic inflammatory vulvo-vaginal lesions are usually caused by fistulas arising from the anus or rectum. However, not all inflammatory lesions within the genitalia are caused in fistulas fashion, even in patients with gastrointestinal Crohn's disease."
Osteoid Osteoma,"Tibial pain, soft tissue swelling, muscle atrophy, spinal scoliosis, joint pain, bone pain","An osteoid osteoma is a benign (non-cancerous) bone tumor that arises from osteoblasts and some components of osteoclasts. It was originally thought to be a smaller version of an osteoblastoma. Osteoid osteomas tend to be less than 1.5 cm in size. The tumor can be in any bone in the body but are most common in long bones, such as the femur and tibia. They account for 10 to 12 percent of all benign bone tumors and 2 to 3 percent of all abnormal bone growths."
Malignant Mastocytosis,"Skin eczema, skin exudation and rupture, skin itchiness","Mastocytosis, a type of mast cell disease, is a rare disorder affecting both children and adults caused by the accumulation of functionally defective mast cells (also called mastocytes) and CD34+ mast cell precursors.
People affected by mastocytosis are susceptible to a variety of symptoms, including itching, hives, and anaphylactic shock, caused by the release of histamine and other pro-inflammatory substances from mast cells.


== Signs and symptoms ==

When mast cells undergo degranulation, the substances that are released can cause a number of symptoms that can vary over time and can range in intensity from mild to severe. Because mast cells play a role in allergic reactions, the symptoms of mastocytosis often are similar to the symptoms of an allergic reaction. They may include, but are not limited to

Fatigue
Skin lesions (urticaria pigmentosa), itching, and dermatographic urticaria (skin writing)
""Darier's Sign"", a reaction to stroking or scratching of urticaria lesions."
Obstetric Shock,"Apathetic expression, slow response, cyanosis of lips and extremities, cold sweats, rapid and thin pulse, severe cases may present with unclear consciousness or coma, obvious oxygen deprivation and cyanosis of the skin and mucous membranes, cool extremities, weak and thin pulse","An amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a life-threatening childbirth (obstetric) emergency in which amniotic fluid enters the blood stream of the mother, triggering a serious reaction which results in cardiorespiratory (heart and lung) collapse and massive bleeding (coagulopathy). The rate at which it occurs is 1 instance per 20,000 births and it comprises 10% of all maternal deaths.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Amniotic fluid embolism is suspected when a woman giving birth experiences very sudden insufficient oxygen to body tissues, low blood pressure, and profuse bleeding due to defects in blood coagulation.
The signs and symptoms of amniotic fluid embolism can vary from one individual to another but involve systemic involvement of multiple organ systems. Often, a patient may present with a cough due to the release of bradykinin, an inflammatory marker released during times of pain and which causes an anaphylactoid reaction."
Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (Nonketotic Hyperglycemic Coma),"Dizziness, desire to sleep, ruddy tongue, dehydration, polydipsia, breath that may have a fruity (acetone) smell, irritability, somnolence, disorientation, coma","Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus. Signs and symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, deep gasping breathing, increased urination, weakness, confusion and occasionally loss of consciousness. A person's breath may develop a specific ""fruity"" or acetone smell. The onset of symptoms is usually rapid. People without a previous diagnosis of diabetes may develop DKA as the first obvious symptom."
Primary Esophageal Malignant Lymphoma,"Weight loss, cough, loss of appetite, upper abdominal pain, hoarseness, fever","Esophageal cancer (American English) or oesophageal cancer (British English) is cancer arising from the esophagusthe food pipe that runs between the throat and the stomach. Symptoms often include difficulty in swallowing and weight loss. Other symptoms may include pain when swallowing, a hoarse voice, enlarged lymph nodes (""glands"") around the collarbone, a dry cough, and possibly coughing up or vomiting blood.
The two main sub-types of the disease are esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (often abbreviated to ESCC), which is more common in the developing world, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which is more common in the developed world. A number of less common types also occur."
Endocrine Myopathy,"Weakness and atrophy of the shoulder girdle, upper limbs, and thoracic and dorsal muscles, muscle atrophy, exophthalmos, atrophy of the muscles of the hand, ophthalmoplegia, strabismus, diplopia, difficulty in upward gaze of both eyes, blepharospasm, myalgia, dysarthria, nystagmus","Endocrine diseases are disorders of the endocrine system. The branch of medicine associated with endocrine disorders is known as endocrinology.


== Types of disease ==
Broadly speaking, endocrine disorders may be subdivided into three groups:

Endocrine gland hypofunction/hyposecretion (leading to hormone deficiency)
Endocrine gland hyperfunction/hypersecretion (leading to hormone excess)
Tumours (benign or malignant) of endocrine glands
Endocrine disorders are often quite complex, involving a mixed picture of hyposecretion and hypersecretion because of the feedback mechanisms involved in the endocrine system. For example, most forms of hyperthyroidism are associated with an excess of thyroid hormone and a low level of thyroid stimulating hormone.

In endocrinology, medical emergencies include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, hypoglycemic coma, acute adrenocortical insufficiency, phaeochromocytoma crisis, hypercalcemic crisis, thyroid storm, myxoedema coma and pituitary apoplexy."
Benign Gallbladder Tumor,"Jaundice, pain in the upper right abdomen, decreased appetite","Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous systems. They most commonly occur in the intestine, where they are often called carcinoid tumors, but they are also found in the pancreas, lung, and the rest of the body.
Although there are many kinds of NETs, they are treated as a group of tissue because the cells of these neoplasms share common features, including a similar histological appearance, having special secretory granules, and often producing biogenic amines and polypeptide hormones.
The term ""neuro"" refers to the dense core granules (DCGs), similar to the DCGs in the serotonergic neurons storing monoamines. The term ""endocrine"" refers to the synthesis and secretion of these monoamines."
Bronchial Adenoma,"Dry cough, recurrent coughing up of blood, asthma, fever","An adenoma is a benign tumor of epithelial tissue with glandular origin, glandular characteristics, or both. Adenomas can grow from many glandular organs, including the adrenal glands, pituitary gland, thyroid, prostate, and others. Some adenomas grow from epithelial tissue in nonglandular areas but express glandular tissue structure (as can happen in familial polyposis coli). Although adenomas are benign, they should be treated as pre-cancerous. Over time adenomas may transform to become malignant, at which point they are called adenocarcinomas."
Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma,"Eye pain, halos around lights, night blindness, visual field loss","Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can lead to damage of the optic nerve. The optic nerve transmits visual information from the eye to the brain. Glaucoma may cause vision loss if left untreated. It has been called the ""silent thief of sight"" because the loss of vision usually occurs slowly over a long period of time. A major risk factor for glaucoma is increased pressure within the eye, known as intraocular pressure (IOP)."
Pediatric Wilms' Tumor,"Fever, abdominal mass, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hematuria","Wilms' tumor or Wilms tumor, also known as nephroblastoma, is a cancer of the kidneys that typically occurs in children (rarely in adults), and occurs most commonly as a renal tumor in child patients. It is named after Max Wilms, the German surgeon (18671918) who first described it.
Approximately 650 cases are diagnosed in the U.S. annually. The majority of cases occur in children with no associated genetic syndromes; however, a minority of children with Wilms' tumor have a congenital abnormality.  It is highly responsive to treatment, with about 90 percent of children being cured."
Bidirectional Ventricular Tachycardia,"Tachycardia, palpitations, chest tightness, chest pain, blackout, shock, sudden death, syncope, heart failure","Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited genetic disorder that predisposes those affected to potentially life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms or arrhythmias. The arrhythmias seen in CPVT typically occur during exercise or at times of emotional stress, and classically take the form of bidirectional ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Those affected may be asymptomatic, but they may also experience blackouts or even sudden cardiac death.
CPVT is caused by genetic mutations affecting proteins that regulate the concentrations of calcium within cardiac muscle cells. The most commonly identified gene is RYR2, which encodes a protein included in an ion channel known as the ryanodine receptor; this channel releases calcium from a cell's internal calcium store, the sarcoplasmic reticulum, during every heartbeat."
Toxic Purpura,"Pigmentary abnormalities, cyanosis, pustules, itching, scales, nodules, ulcers, herpes, cherry-red facial congestion, purpura, papules","Purpura () is a condition of  red or purple discolored spots on the skin that do not blanch on applying pressure. The spots are caused by bleeding underneath the skin secondary to platelet disorders, vascular disorders, coagulation disorders, or other causes. They measure 310 mm, whereas petechiae measure less than 3 mm, and ecchymoses greater than 1 cm.
Purpura is common with typhus and can be present with meningitis caused by meningococci or septicaemia.  In particular, meningococcus (Neisseria meningitidis), a Gram-negative diplococcus organism, releases endotoxin when it lyses."
Autosomal Recessive Hereditary Cerebral Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy,"Headache, dizziness, palpitations, shortness of breath, heart palpitations","CADASIL or CADASIL syndrome, involving cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, is the most common form of hereditary stroke disorder and is thought to be caused by mutations of the NOTCH3 gene on chromosome 19. The disease belongs to a family of disorders called the leukodystrophies. The most common clinical manifestations are migraine headaches and transient ischemic attacks or strokes, which usually occur between 40 and 50 years of age, although MRI is able to detect signs of the disease years prior to clinical manifestation of disease.
The condition was identified and named by French researchers Marie-Germaine Bousser and Elisabeth Tournier-Lasserve in the 1990s. Together with two other researchers, Hugues Chabriat and Anne Joutel, they received the 2019 Brain Prize for their research into the condition."
Xue Lao (Blood Exhaustion),"Chills, high fever, anemia, enlargement of the liver and spleen","Maternal death in fiction is a common theme encountered in literature, movies, and other media.
The death of a mother during pregnancy, childbirth or immediately afterwards is a tragic event. The chances of a child surviving such an extreme birth are compromised.  In literature, the death of a new mother is a powerful device: it removes one character and places the surviving child into an often hostile environment which has to be overcome.


== Literature ==


=== 11th century ===
In Murasaki Shikibu's novel The Tale of Genji, Genjis first wife, Aoi no Ue was suffering form attacking of Lady Rokuj's spirit during her pregnancy."
Sepsis,"High fever, vomiting, skin petechiae, bruises, lethargy, coma","Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
This initial stage of sepsis is followed by suppression of the immune system. Common signs and symptoms include fever, increased heart rate, increased breathing rate, and confusion. There may also be symptoms related to a specific infection, such as a cough with pneumonia, or painful urination with a kidney infection. The very young, old, and people with a weakened immune system may not have any symptoms that are specific to their infection, and their body temperature may be low or normal instead of constituting a fever."
Papillary cystadenoma,Painless swelling found anterior to the neck,"Cystadenoma (or ""cystoma"") is a type of cystic adenoma. When malignant, it is called cystadenocarcinoma.


== Classification ==
When not otherwise specified, the ICD-O coding is 8440/0. However, the following classifications also exist:


=== By form ===
serous cystadenoma (8441-8442)
papillary cystadenoma (8450-8451, 8561)
mucinous cystadenoma (8470-8473)


=== By location ===
Bile duct cystadenoma (8161) or biliary cystadenoma is a slow-growing tumour arising from bile ducts of the liver. The presence of endocrine cells in the tumour also indicates its origin from the glands surrounding the bile ducts."
Actinic Cheilitis,"Dry lips, cracking, and scaling","Actinic cheilitis  is cheilitis (lip inflammation) caused by long term sunlight exposure. Essentially it is a burn, and a variant of actinic keratosis which occurs on the lip. It is a premalignant condition, as it can develop into squamous cell carcinoma (a type of mouth cancer).


== Signs and symptoms ==
AC almost always affects the lower lip and only rarely the upper lip, probably because the lower lip is more exposed to the sun. In the unusual cases reported where it affects the upper lip, this may be due to upper lip prominence."
Aortic Stenosis,"Chest tightness, palpitations, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing","Aortic stenosis (AS or AoS) is the narrowing  of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aorta begins), such that problems result. It may occur at the aortic valve as well as above and below this level. It typically gets worse over time. Symptoms often come on gradually with a decreased ability to exercise often occurring first. If heart failure, loss of consciousness, or heart related chest pain occur due to AS the outcomes are worse."
Pneumocystis Pneumonia,"Shortness of breath, coughing, cyanosis, three-concave sign, difficulty breathing, restlessness, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, fever, dry cough","Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), also known as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), is a form of pneumonia that is caused by the yeast-like fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii.
Pneumocystis specimens are commonly found in the lungs of healthy people although it is usually not a cause for disease. However, they are a source of opportunistic infection and can cause lung infections in people with a weak immune system or other predisposing health conditions. PCP is seen in people with HIV/AIDS (who account for 30-40% of PCP cases), those using medications that suppress the immune system, and people with cancer, autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, and chronic lung disease.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms may develop over several days or weeks and may include: shortness of breath and/or difficulty breathing (of gradual onset), fever, dry/non-productive cough, weight loss, night sweats, chills, and fatigue."
Adult T-cell Leukemia,"Enlarged lymph nodes, rapidly progressing skin lesions, hypercalcemia, fatigue, apathy, mental confusion, polyuria, and thirst","Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL or ATLL) is a rare cancer of the immune system's T-cells caused by human T cell leukemia/lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). All ATL cells contain integrated HTLV-1 provirus further supporting that causal role of the virus in the cause of the neoplasm. A small number of HTLV-1 individuals progress to develop ATL with a long latency period between infection and ATL development. ATL is categorized into four subtypes: acute, smoldering, lymphoma-type, and chronic. Acute and lymphoma-type are known to particularly be aggressive with poorer prognosis."
Gastric Mucosal Prolapse Syndrome,"Belching, abdominal distension, persistent pain in the upper middle abdomen, tenderness in the upper abdomen, gastric mucosal prolapse, colic, radiating pain, abdominal pain accompanied by nausea, vomiting","A rectal prolapse occurs when walls of the rectum have prolapsed to such a degree that they protrude out of the anus and are visible outside the body. However, most researchers agree that there are 3 to 5 different types of rectal prolapse, depending on whether the prolapsed section is visible externally, and whether the full or only partial thickness of the rectal wall is involved.
Rectal prolapse may occur without any symptoms, but depending upon the nature of the prolapse there may be mucous discharge (mucus coming from the anus), rectal bleeding, degrees of fecal incontinence, and obstructed defecation symptoms.
Rectal prolapse is generally more common in elderly women, although it may occur at any age and in either sex. It is very rarely life-threatening, but the symptoms can be debilitating if left untreated."
Arteritis,"Infectious fever, joint pain, vomiting, local tenderness, accelerated erythrocyte sedimentation, hypoxic-ischemic nerve damage, ischemic contracture","Arteritis is a vascular disorder characterized by inflammation of the walls of arteries, usually as a result of infection or autoimmune responses. Arteritis, a complex disorder, is still not entirely understood. Arteritis may be distinguished by its different types, based on the organ systems affected by the disease. A complication of arteritis is thrombosis, which can be fatal. Arteritis and phlebitis are forms of vasculitis."
Post-traumatic Brain Herniation,"Visible bloody cerebrospinal fluid or serum-like exudate, pulsating, minimal surface secretions, accompanied by high fever, chills","Brain herniation is a potentially deadly side effect of very high pressure within the skull that occurs when a part of the brain is squeezed across structures within the skull. The brain can shift across such structures as the falx cerebri, the tentorium cerebelli, and even through the foramen magnum (the hole in the base of the skull through which the spinal cord connects with the brain).  Herniation can be caused by a number of factors that cause a mass effect and increase intracranial pressure (ICP): these include traumatic brain injury, intracranial hemorrhage, or brain tumor.
Herniation can also occur in the absence of high ICP when mass lesions such as hematomas occur at the borders of brain compartments. In such cases local pressure is increased at the place where the herniation occurs, but this pressure is not transmitted to the rest of the brain, and therefore does not register as an increase in ICP.
Because herniation puts extreme pressure on parts of the brain and thereby cuts off the blood supply to various parts of the brain, it is often fatal."
Pediatric Viral Myocarditis,"Fatigue, shortness of breath, palpitations, chest tightness, pale complexion, loss of consciousness, cyanosis, convulsions, respiratory distress","Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue. Some people or animals with hepatitis have no symptoms, whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hepatitis is acute if it resolves within six months, and chronic if it lasts longer than six months. Acute hepatitis can resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or (rarely) result in acute liver failure. Chronic hepatitis may progress to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer."
Secondary Renal Disease,"Oliguria, back pain, hematuria, malnutrition","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a type of long-term kidney disease, defined by the sustained presence of abnormal kidney function and/or abnormal kidney structure. To meet criteria for CKD, the abnormalities must be present for at least three months. Early in the course of CKD, patients are usually asymptomatic, but later symptoms may include leg swelling, feeling tired, vomiting, loss of appetite, and confusion. Complications can relate to hormonal dysfunction of the kidneys and include (in chronological order) high blood pressure (often related to activation of the reninangiotensin system), bone disease, and anemia. Additionally CKD patients have markedly increased cardiovascular complications with increased risks of death and hospitalization."
Hodgkin's Lymphoma,"Night sweats, low-grade fever, nausea, abdominal pain, dry cough, high fever, herpes, itchy skin","Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a type of lymphoma in which cancer originates from a specific type of white blood cell called lymphocytes, where multinucleated ReedSternberg cells (RS cells) are present in the lymph nodes. The condition was named after the English physician Thomas Hodgkin, who first described it in 1832. Symptoms may include fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Often, non-painful enlarged lymph nodes occur in the neck, under the arm, or in the groin. Persons affected may feel tired or be itchy."
Cold Agglutinin Disease (CAD),"Jaundice, dizziness, anemia, pale skin, fatigue, chills, cyanosis","Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of high concentrations of circulating cold sensitive antibodies, usually IgM and autoantibodies that are also active at temperatures below 30 C (86 F), directed against red blood cells, causing them to agglutinate and undergo lysis. It is a form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, specifically one in which antibodies bind red blood cells only at low body temperatures, typically 2831 C.
When affected people's blood is exposed to cold temperatures (32 F (0 C; 273 K) to 50 F (10 C; 283 K)), certain proteins that normally attack bacteria (IgM antibodies) attach themselves to red blood cells and bind them together into clumps (agglutination). This eventually causes red blood cells to be prematurely destroyed (hemolysis) leading to anemia and other associated signs and symptoms.
Cold agglutinin disease can be primary (unknown cause) or secondary, due to an underlying condition such as an infection, another autoimmune disease, or certain cancers. Treatment depends on many factors including the severity of the condition, the signs and symptoms present in each person, and the underlying cause."
Pediatric Fungal Pneumonia,"Coughing, expectorating sputum, hemoptysis, chest pain, weight loss, fever, abdominal distension, diarrhea, irritability, drowsiness, coma, cyanosis","Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) refers to pneumonia (any of several lung diseases) contracted by a person outside of the healthcare system. In contrast, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is seen in patients who have recently visited a hospital or who live in long-term care facilities. CAP is common, affecting people of all ages, and its symptoms occur as a result of oxygen-absorbing areas of the lung (alveoli) filling with fluid. This inhibits lung function, causing dyspnea, fever, chest pains and cough.
CAP, the most common type of pneumonia, is a leading cause of illness and death worldwide."
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Infertility,"High fever, chills, amenorrhea, congestion, low fever, fatigue, peritonitis, ascites","Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), also known as pelvic inflammatory disorder, is an infection of the upper part of the female reproductive system, mainly the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often, there may be no symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present, may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, bleeding after sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long-term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.
The disease is caused by bacteria that spread from the vagina and cervix."
Congenital Megacolon in Children,"Failure to pass meconium, persistent constipation, vomiting, abdominal distension, decreased appetite, colonic obstruction","Toxic megacolon is an acute form of colonic distension. It is characterized by a very dilated colon (megacolon), accompanied by abdominal distension (bloating), and sometimes fever, abdominal pain, or shock.
Toxic megacolon is usually a complication of inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis and, more rarely, Crohn's disease, and of some infections of the colon, including Clostridioides difficile infections, which have led to pseudomembranous colitis. Other forms of megacolon exist and can be congenital (present since birth, such as Hirschsprung's disease). It can also be caused by Entamoeba histolytica and Shigella."
Bartonellosis,"Mild fever, Lassitude, High fever, Joint pain, Chills, Coma, Muscle soreness, Swollen lymph nodes","Bartonellosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus Bartonella. Bartonella species cause diseases such as Carrin's disease, trench fever, cat-scratch disease, bacillary angiomatosis, peliosis hepatis, chronic bacteremia, endocarditis, chronic lymphadenopathy, and neurological disorders.


== Presentation ==


=== Carrin's disease ===

Patients can develop two clinical phases: an acute septic phase and a chronic eruptive phase associated with skin lesions. In the acute phase (also known as Oroya fever or fiebre de la Oroya), B. bacilliformis infection is a sudden, potentially life-threatening infection associated with high fever and decreased levels of circulating red blood cells (i.e., hemolytic anemia) and transient immunosuppression. B. bacilliformis is considered the most deadly species to date, with a death rate of up to 90% during the acute phase, which typically lasts two to four weeks."
Sudden Cardiac Death in the Elderly,"Precordial discomfort, chest oppression, palpitations, shortness of breath, abnormal breathing, loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest","It remains a difficult medical challenge to prevent the sudden cardiac death of athletes, typically defined as natural, unexpected death from cardiac arrest within one hour of the onset of collapse symptoms, excluding additional time on mechanical life support. (Wider definitions of sudden death are also in use, but not usually applied to the athletic situation.) Most causes relate to congenital or acquired cardiovascular disease with no symptoms noted before the fatal event. The prevalence of any single, associated condition is low, probably less than 0.3% of the population in the athletes' age group, and the sensitivity and specificity of common screening tests leave much to be desired. The single most important predictor is fainting or near-fainting during exercise, which should require detailed explanation and investigation. The victims include many well-known names, especially in professional association football, and close relatives are often at risk for similar cardiac problems."
Acute Mixed Lineage Leukemia,"Hepatomegaly, anemia, recurrent high fever, sustained remittent fever, lymphadenopathy, non-infectious fever, axillary lymph node enlargement, splenomegaly, easy bruising","Acute leukemia or acute leukaemia is a family of serious medical conditions relating to an original diagnosis of leukemia. In most cases, these can be classified according to the lineage, myeloid or lymphoid, of the malignant cells that grow uncontrolled, but some are mixed and for those such an assignment is not possible.
Forms of acute leukemia include:

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a rare form of which is acute erythroid leukemia.
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Types of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia include adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and (precursor) T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma."
Coronary Heart Disease,"Angina, chest pain or discomfort that occurs behind the sternum or precordial area upon exertion or emotional stress, and chest tightness during physical activities","Coronary artery disease (CAD), also called coronary heart disease (CHD), or ischemic heart disease (IHD), is a type of heart disease involving the reduction of blood flow to the cardiac muscle due to a build-up of atheromatous plaque in the arteries of the heart. It is the most common of the cardiovascular diseases. CAD can cause stable angina, unstable angina, myocardial ischemia, and myocardial infarction.
A common symptom is angina, which is chest pain or discomfort that may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Occasionally it may feel like heartburn."
Hemoglobin D Disease,"Splenomegaly, Anemia","Hemoglobin D (HbD) is a variant of hemoglobin, a protein complex that makes up red blood cells. Based on the locations of the original identification, it has been known by several names such as hemoglobin D-Los Angeles, hemoglobin D-Punjab, D-North Carolina, D-Portugal, D-Oak Ridge, and D-Chicago. Hemoglobin D-Los Angeles was the first type identified by Harvey Itano in 1951, and was subsequently discovered that hemoglobin D-Punjab is the most abundant type that is common in the Sikhs of Punjab (of both Pakistan and India) and of Gujarat.
Unlike normal adult human hemoglobin (HbA) which has glutamic acid at its 121 amino acid position, it has glutamine instead. The single amino acid substitution can cause various blood diseases, from fatal genetic anemia to mild hemolytic anemia, an abnormal destruction of red blood cells."
Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia,"Rapid heartbeat, palpitations, chest tightness, dizziness, fainting, convulsions, shortness of breath, sudden death","Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach or VT) is a cardiovascular disorder in which fast heart rate occurs in the ventricles of the heart. Although a few seconds of VT may not result in permanent problems, longer periods are dangerous; and multiple episodes over a short period of time are referred to as an electrical storm. Short periods may occur without symptoms, or present with lightheadedness, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, and decreased level of consciousness. Ventricular tachycardia may lead to coma and persistent vegetative state due to lack of blood and oxygen to the brain. Ventricular tachycardia may result in ventricular fibrillation (VF) and turn into cardiac arrest."
Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding (DUB),"Irregular vaginal bleeding, anemia, irregular menstrual cycle","Abnormal uterine bleeding is vaginal bleeding from the uterus that is abnormally frequent, lasts excessively long, is heavier than normal, or is irregular. The term ""dysfunctional uterine bleeding"" was used when no underlying cause was present. Quality of life may be negatively affected.
The underlying causes may be structural or non-structural and are classified in accordance with the FIGO system 1 & 2. Common causes include: Ovulation problems, fibroids, the lining of the uterus growing into the uterine wall, uterine polyps, underlying bleeding problems, side effects from birth control, or cancer."
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS),"Orthopneic breathing, cyanosis, chest deformity, diminished breath sounds, wheezing, abnormal sweating","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a type of respiratory failure characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs. Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnea), rapid breathing (tachypnea), and bluish skin coloration (cyanosis). For those who survive, a decreased quality of life is common.
Causes may include sepsis, pancreatitis, trauma, pneumonia, and aspiration. The underlying mechanism involves diffuse injury to cells which form the barrier of the microscopic air sacs of the lungs, surfactant dysfunction, activation of the immune system, and dysfunction of the body's regulation of blood clotting."
Chromoblastomycosis,"Nodules, papules, large patches on the chest","Chromoblastomycosis  is a long-term fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (a chronic subcutaneous mycosis).
It can be caused by many different types of fungi which become implanted under the skin, often by thorns or splinters. Chromoblastomycosis spreads very slowly.
It is rarely fatal and usually has a good prognosis, but it can be very difficult to cure. Several treatment options exist, including medication and surgery."
Drug-induced Peripheral Neuropathy,"Sensory disturbances, rough skin, malnutrition, myasthenic muscle weakness, formication, numbness","Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a nerve-damaging side effect of antineoplastic agents in the common cancer treatment, chemotherapy. CIPN afflicts between 30% and 40% of patients undergoing chemotherapy. Antineoplastic agents in chemotherapy are designed to eliminate rapidly dividing cancer cells, but they can also damage healthy structures, including the peripheral nervous system. CIPN involves various symptoms such as tingling, pain, and numbness in the hands and feet. These symptoms can impair activities of daily living, such as typing or dressing, reduce balance, and increase risk of falls and hospitalizations."
Purpura Fulminans,"Perineal prolapse, vaginal prolapsed mass, difficulty in urination, menstrual changes, increased vaginal discharge, difficult labor","Purpura fulminans is an acute, often fatal, thrombotic disorder which manifests as blood spots, bruising and discolouration of the skin resulting from coagulation in small blood vessels within the skin and rapidly leads to skin necrosis and disseminated intravascular coagulation.


== Causes ==

Purpura fulminans is caused by defects in the protein C anticoagulant pathway. Identification of the cause of purpura fulminans often depends on the patient's age and circumstances of presentation.


=== Congenital protein C deficiency ===
Congenital (inherited) defects in protein C activity are autosomal dominant and may be partial or severe loss of function. Hundreds of natural mutations of the protein C gene (PROC) have been identified."
Spontaneous Angina,"excessive sweating, pain, fear","Angina, also known as angina pectoris, is chest pain or pressure, usually caused by insufficient blood flow to the heart muscle (myocardium). It is most commonly a symptom of coronary artery disease.
Angina is typically the result of partial obstruction or spasm of the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. The main mechanism of coronary artery obstruction is atherosclerosis as part of coronary artery disease. Other causes of angina include abnormal heart rhythms, heart failure and, less commonly, anemia."
Acquired Perforating Dermatosis,"Papules, epidermal keratinization, dental anomalies","Acquired perforating dermatosis is clinically and histopathologically similar to perforating folliculitis, also associated with chronic kidney failure, with or without hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, and/or diabetes mellitus, but not identical to Kyrle disease.:1462


== Signs and symptoms ==
On the hair-bearing limbs of adults, acquired perforating dermatosis typically manifests as extremely itchy follicular hyperkeratotic papules, which can occasionally become umbilicated. There may also be widespread papules.


== Causes ==
It is common for acquired perforating dermatosis to be linked to either renal failure, diabetes mellitus, or both. Ten percent or so of dialysis patients develop acquired perforating dermatosis. Additionally, it is sporadically linked to HIV, malignancy, hypothyroidism, and liver disease."
Rectal Prolapse,"Rectal prolapse, sensation of incomplete evacuation, anal heaviness, urgency followed by relief after defecation, anal pain, rectal bleeding","A rectal prolapse occurs when walls of the rectum have prolapsed to such a degree that they protrude out of the anus and are visible outside the body. However, most researchers agree that there are 3 to 5 different types of rectal prolapse, depending on whether the prolapsed section is visible externally, and whether the full or only partial thickness of the rectal wall is involved.
Rectal prolapse may occur without any symptoms, but depending upon the nature of the prolapse there may be mucous discharge (mucus coming from the anus), rectal bleeding, degrees of fecal incontinence, and obstructed defecation symptoms.
Rectal prolapse is generally more common in elderly women, although it may occur at any age and in either sex. It is very rarely life-threatening, but the symptoms can be debilitating if left untreated."
Traumatic Biliary Injury,"Often overshadowed by symptoms of shock, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, peritonitis, or obvious signs of fractures, jaundice","Biliary injury (bile duct injury) is the traumatic damage of the bile ducts. It is most commonly an iatrogenic complication of cholecystectomy (surgical removal of the gallbladder), but can also be caused by other operations or by major trauma. The risk of biliary injury is higher during laparoscopic cholecystectomy than during open cholecystectomy. Biliary injury may lead to several complications and may even cause death if not diagnosed in time and managed properly. Ideally biliary injury should be managed at a center with facilities and expertise in endoscopy, radiology and surgery."
Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma,"Fever, fatigue, hematuria, renal pain, mass","Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a kidney cancer that originates in the lining of the proximal convoluted tubule, a part of the very small tubes in the kidney that transport primary urine. RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, responsible for approximately 9095% of cases. It is more common in men (with a male-to-female ratio of up to 2:1). It is most commonly diagnosed in the elderly (especially in people over 75 years of age).
Initial treatment is most commonly either partial or complete removal of the affected kidney(s)."
Cervical Fracture,"Neck pain, restricted movement, neck muscle spasm, widespread tenderness in the neck, numbness, swelling, and severe localized symptoms","A cervical fracture, commonly called a broken neck, is a fracture of any of the seven cervical vertebrae in the neck. Examples of common causes in humans are traffic collisions and diving into shallow water. Abnormal movement of neck bones or pieces of bone can cause a spinal cord injury, resulting in loss of sensation, paralysis, or usually death soon thereafter (~1 min.), primarily via compromising neurological supply to the respiratory muscles and innervation to the heart.


== Causes ==

Considerable force is needed to cause a cervical fracture. Vehicle collisions and falls are common causes."
Tuberculosis,"Cough, hemoptysis, fever, night sweats, and gradual weight loss, etc.","Tuberculosis (TB), also known colloquially as the ""white death"", or historically as consumption, is a contagious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteria. Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections show no symptoms, in which case it is known as inactive or latent tuberculosis. A small proportion of latent infections progress to active disease that, if left untreated, can be fatal. Typical symptoms of active TB are chronic cough with blood-containing mucus, fever, night sweats, and weight loss."
Colon Injury,"Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, hematochezia, abdominal tenderness, abdominal muscle tension, and disappearance of bowel sounds","Prichard Coln Melndez (born September 19, 1992) is an American-Puerto Rican former professional boxer, honorary WBC World Champion, and gold medal winner at the 2010 Pan American Youth Championship in the 64 kg (141 pounds) category. After a 2015 match with Terrel Williams, in which he was repeatedly struck in the back of his head, Coln collapsed in the dressing room and remained in a coma for 221 days due to a brain hemorrhage. He was then in a persistent vegetative state and unable to speak. He was eventually released from the hospital, and is currently receiving physiotherapy and is now able to talk through the use of a computer.


== Early years and amateur career ==
Prichard Coln was born in Maitland, Florida."
Anterior Spinal Artery Syndrome,"Lower back pain, sensory disturbances, gastrointestinal bloating, paralysis, persistent dull pain in the lower back","Anterior spinal artery syndrome (also known as ""anterior spinal cord syndrome"") is syndrome caused by ischemia of the area supplied by the  anterior spinal artery, resulting in loss of function of the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord. The region affected includes the descending  corticospinal tract, ascending spinothalamic tract, and autonomic fibers. It is characterized by a corresponding loss of motor function, loss of pain and temperature sensation, and hypotension.
Anterior spinal artery syndrome is the most common form of spinal cord infarction. The anterior spinal cord is at increased risk for infarction because it is supplied by the single anterior spinal artery and has little collateral circulation, unlike the posterior spinal cord which is supplied by two posterior spinal arteries."
Alcoholic Cardiomyopathy,"Alcohol craving, arrhythmia, cardiac enlargement, chest pain, pleural effusion, frequent ventricular premature contractions, conduction block, holiday heart syndrome, ventricular fibrillation, atypical chest pain, angina, orthostatic hypertension","Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (ACM) is a disease in which the long-term consumption of alcohol leads to heart failure. ACM is a type of dilated cardiomyopathy. The heart is unable to pump blood efficiently, leading to heart failure. It can affect other parts of the body if the heart failure is severe. It is most common in males between the ages of 35 and 50."
Ovarian Small Cell Carcinoma,"Abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, lower abdominal mass, ascites, hypercalcemia","Small-cell carcinoma, also known as oat cell carcinoma, is a type of highly malignant cancer that most commonly arises within the lung, although it can occasionally arise in other body sites, such as the cervix, prostate, and gastrointestinal tract. Compared to non-small cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma is more aggressive, with a shorter doubling time, higher growth fraction, and earlier development of metastases.
Extensive stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is classified as a rare disorder. Ten-year relative survival rate (combined limited and extensive SCLC) is 3.5% (4.3% for women, 2.8% for men). Survival can be higher or lower based on a combination of factors including stage, age, sex and race."
Edema,"Capillary rupture, skin congestion, pain","Edema (American English), also spelled oedema (British English), and also known as fluid retention, swelling, dropsy and hydropsy, is the build-up of fluid in the body's tissue. Most commonly, the legs or arms are affected. Symptoms may include skin that feels tight, the area feeling heavy, and joint stiffness. Other symptoms depend on the underlying cause.
Causes may include venous insufficiency, heart failure, kidney problems, low protein levels, liver problems, deep vein thrombosis, infections, kwashiorkor, angioedema, certain medications, and lymphedema."
Polycythemia Vera in the Elderly,"Dizziness, headache, head distension, fatigue, vertigo, tinnitus, palpitations, blurred vision, shortness of breath, heat intolerance, sweating, upper abdominal fullness, difficulty breathing, numbness of limbs, etc.","In oncology, polycythemia vera (PV) is an uncommon myeloproliferative neoplasm in which the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells.  The majority of cases are caused by mutations in the JAK2 gene, most commonly resulting in a single amino acid change in its protein product from valine to phenylalanine at position 617.
Most of the health concerns associated with polycythemia vera are caused by the blood being thicker as a result of the increased red blood cells.  It is more common in the elderly and may be symptomatic or asymptomatic.  Common signs and symptoms include itching (pruritus), and severe burning pain in the hands or feet that is usually accompanied by a reddish or bluish coloration of the skin."
Secondary Cutaneous Follicle Center Cell Lymphoma,"Hepatomegaly, Anemia, Splenomegaly","Lymphoma is a group of blood and lymph tumors that develop from lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). The name typically refers to just the cancerous versions rather than all such tumours. Signs and symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, drenching sweats, unintended weight loss, itching, and constantly feeling tired. The enlarged lymph nodes are usually painless. The sweats are most common at night."
Myopia Surgery,"Blurry objects, vision impairment, abnormal photosensitivity","Myopia, also known as near-sightedness and short-sightedness, is an eye condition where light from distant objects focuses in front of, instead of on, the retina. As a result, distant objects appear blurry, while close objects appear normal. Other symptoms may include headaches and eye strain. Severe myopia is associated with an increased risk of macular degeneration, retinal detachment, cataracts, and glaucoma.
Myopia results from the length of the eyeball growing too long or less commonly the lens being too strong."
Gastric Benign Tumor,Discomfort and pain in the gastric region,"A benign tumor is a mass of cells (tumor) that does not invade neighboring tissue or metastasize (spread throughout the body). Compared to malignant (cancerous) tumors, benign tumors generally have a slower growth rate. Benign tumors have relatively well differentiated cells. They are often surrounded by an outer surface (fibrous sheath of connective tissue) or stay contained within the epithelium. Common examples of benign tumors include moles and uterine fibroids."
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL),"Fever, gum bleeding, nosebleeds, petechiae, vaginal bleeding, pelvic mass, menstrual disorders, pleural effusion, purpura, anemia, joint pain, sternal tenderness","Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a cancer of the lymphoid line of blood cells characterized by the development of large numbers of immature lymphocytes. Symptoms may include feeling tired, pale skin color, fever, easy bleeding or bruising, enlarged lymph nodes, or bone pain. As an acute leukemia, ALL progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.
In most cases, the cause is unknown. Genetic risk factors may include Down syndrome, LiFraumeni syndrome, or neurofibromatosis type 1."
Dedifferentiated Chondrosarcoma,"Rapid, progressive pain and swelling","Chondrosarcoma is a bone sarcoma, a primary cancer composed of cells derived from transformed cells that produce cartilage. A chondrosarcoma is a member of a category of tumors of bone and soft tissue known as sarcomas.  About 30% of bone sarcomas are chondrosarcomas. It is resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Unlike other primary bone sarcomas that mainly affect children and adolescents, a chondrosarcoma can present at any age."
Acute Glomerulonephritis in Children,"Edema, oliguria, hematuria, hypertension, syncope, headache, cough, cyanosis, purpura, rales, nausea and vomiting, convulsions","Acute proliferative glomerulonephritis is a disorder of the small blood vessels of the kidney. It is a common complication of bacterial infections, typically skin infection by Streptococcus bacteria types 12, 4 and 1 (impetigo) but also after streptococcal pharyngitis, for which it is also known as postinfectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN) or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). It can be a risk factor for future albuminuria. In adults, the signs and symptoms of infection may still be present at the time when the kidney problems develop, and the terms infection-related glomerulonephritis or bacterial infection-related glomerulonephritis are also used. Acute glomerulonephritis resulted in 19,000 deaths in 2013, down from 24,000 deaths in 1990 worldwide."
Pregnancy-associated Pulmonary Embolism,"Dyspnea, pallor, cold sweat, acute pain, right heart failure, cerebral hypoxia, chest pain during pregnancy, shock, coughing, syncope","An amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a life-threatening childbirth (obstetric) emergency in which amniotic fluid enters the blood stream of the mother, triggering a serious reaction which results in cardiorespiratory (heart and lung) collapse and massive bleeding (coagulopathy). The rate at which it occurs is 1 instance per 20,000 births and it comprises 10% of all maternal deaths.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Amniotic fluid embolism is suspected when a woman giving birth experiences very sudden insufficient oxygen to body tissues, low blood pressure, and profuse bleeding due to defects in blood coagulation.
The signs and symptoms of amniotic fluid embolism can vary from one individual to another but involve systemic involvement of multiple organ systems. Often, a patient may present with a cough due to the release of bradykinin, an inflammatory marker released during times of pain and which causes an anaphylactoid reaction."
Spinal Nerve Sheath Tumors,"Headache, spinal cord compression, fever, lymphadenopathy, involuntary movements, seizures and seizure-like episodes, thoracolumbar spine injury, transverse myelitis, sensory disturbances, upper cervical spinal cord lesions, neuralgia, gait abnormalities","A nerve sheath tumor is a type of tumor of the nervous system (nervous system neoplasm) which is made up primarily of the myelin surrounding nerves. Nerve sheath tumors can be benign or malignant, and may affect both the peripheral and central nervous systems. There are three main types of nerve sheath tumors: schwannomas, neurofibromas, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.


== Classification of nerve sheath tumors ==


=== Spinal nerve sheath tumors ===
Spinal nerve sheath tumors are typically intradural, meaning that they arise inside the dura mater surrounding the spinal cord (thecal sac), but may also be found in other areas of the spine. Spinal nerve sheath tumors generally arise as single lesions."
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD),"Neurasthenia syndrome, memory disorders, limb weakness, unsteady gait, lack of concentration, joint rigidity, progressive muscular paralysis, tremors, irritability, headache, dizziness, fatigue","CreutzfeldtJakob disease (CJD) is an incurable, always fatal neurodegenerative disease belonging to the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) group. Early symptoms include memory problems, behavioral changes, poor coordination, and visual and/or auditory disturbances. Later symptoms include dementia, involuntary movements, blindness and/or deafness, weakness, and coma. About 70% of people die within a year of diagnosis. The name ""CreutzfeldtJakob disease"" was introduced by Walther Spielmeyer in 1922, after the German neurologists Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt and Alfons Maria Jakob."
Idiopathic Ventricular Tachycardia,"Palpitations, chest tightness, dizziness, tachycardia, syncope, nausea, decreased blood pressure","Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach or VT) is a cardiovascular disorder in which fast heart rate occurs in the ventricles of the heart. Although a few seconds of VT may not result in permanent problems, longer periods are dangerous; and multiple episodes over a short period of time are referred to as an electrical storm. Short periods may occur without symptoms, or present with lightheadedness, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, and decreased level of consciousness. Ventricular tachycardia may lead to coma and persistent vegetative state due to lack of blood and oxygen to the brain. Ventricular tachycardia may result in ventricular fibrillation (VF) and turn into cardiac arrest."
Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection,"Fever, relapsing fever, remittent fever, abscess, soft tissue infection, pustule, cellulitis, ulcer, subcutaneous nodule, neonatal diarrhea, cough with sputum, purulent sputum","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common encapsulated, Gram-negative, aerobicfacultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium that can cause disease in plants and animals, including humans. A species of considerable medical importance, P. aeruginosa is a multidrug resistant pathogen recognized for its ubiquity, its intrinsically advanced antibiotic resistance mechanisms, and its association with serious illnesses  hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and various sepsis syndromes. P. aeruginosa is able to selectively inhibit various antibiotics from penetrating its outer membrane - and has high resistance to several antibiotics. According to the World Health Organization P. aeruginosa poses one of the greatest threats to humans in terms of antibiotic resistance.
The organism is considered opportunistic insofar as serious infection often occurs during existing diseases or conditions  most notably cystic fibrosis and traumatic burns."
Adult-onset Still's Disease,"Joint pain, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, papules, leukocytosis, pruritus, myalgia, pharyngeal congestion, hepatosplenomegaly, liver dysfunction, jaundice, palpitations","Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a form of Still's disease, a rare systemic autoinflammatory disease characterized by the classic triad of fevers, joint pain, and a distinctive salmon-colored bumpy rash. The disease is considered a diagnosis of exclusion. Levels of the iron-binding protein ferritin may be extremely elevated with this disorder. AOSD may present in a similar manner to other inflammatory diseases and to autoimmune diseases, which must be ruled out before making the diagnosis.
Prognosis is usually favorable but manifestations of the disease affecting the lungs, heart, or kidneys may occasionally cause severe life-threatening complications."
Breast Disease,"Breast enlargement, chest pain, breast distention","Breast diseases make up a number of conditions. The most common symptoms are a breast mass, breast pain, and nipple discharge.
A majority of breast diseases are noncancerous.
Although breast disease may be benign, or non-life threatening there remains an associated risk with potentially a higher risk of developing breast cancer later on.


== Tumor ==

A breast tumor is an abnormal mass of tissue in the breast as a result of neoplasia."
Germ Cell Tumor,"Polydipsia, somnolence, obesity, headache, vomiting, polyuria, precocious puberty","A germ cell tumor (GCT) is a neoplasm derived from primordial germ cells. Germ-cell tumors can be cancerous or benign. Germ cell tumors typically originate from  the gonads (ovary and testis), but can arise in other areas of the body. Extragonadal GCTs are thought to result from abnormal migration of germ cell precursors during development of the embryo.


== Classification ==

GCTs are classified by their histology, regardless of location in the body."
Gynecomastia,"Obesity, Enlarged Breasts, Increased Vocal Pitch","Gynecomastia (also spelled gynaecomastia) is the non-cancerous enlargement of one or both breasts in men due to the growth of breast tissue as a result of a hormone imbalance between estrogens and androgens. Physically speaking, gynecomastia is completely benign, but it is associated with significant psychological distress, social stigma, and dysphoria.
Gynecomastia can be normal in newborn male babies due to exposure to estrogen from the mother, in adolescent boys going through puberty, in older men over the age of 50, and in obese men. Most occurrences of gynecomastia do not require diagnostic tests. Gynecomastia may be caused by abnormal hormone changes, any condition that leads to an increase in the ratio of estrogens/androgens such as liver disease, kidney failure, thyroid disease and some non-breast tumors."
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Children,"Anemia, pallor, hematuria, irregular fever, pale skin, pale lips, shortness of breath after activity, palpitations, edema, skin purpura, ecchymosis","Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a cancer of the lymphoid line of blood cells characterized by the development of large numbers of immature lymphocytes. Symptoms may include feeling tired, pale skin color, fever, easy bleeding or bruising, enlarged lymph nodes, or bone pain. As an acute leukemia, ALL progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.
In most cases, the cause is unknown. Genetic risk factors may include Down syndrome, LiFraumeni syndrome, or neurofibromatosis type 1."
Retropharyngeal abscess,"Laryngeal edema, drooling","Retropharyngeal abscess (RPA) is an abscess located in the tissues in the back of the throat behind the posterior pharyngeal wall (the retropharyngeal space).  Because RPAs typically occur in deep tissue, they are difficult to diagnose by physical examination alone. RPA is a relatively uncommon illness, and therefore may not receive early diagnosis in children presenting with stiff neck, malaise, difficulty swallowing, or other symptoms listed below. Early diagnosis is key, while a delay in diagnosis and treatment may lead to death. Parapharyngeal space communicates with retropharyngeal space and an infection of retropharyngeal space can pass down behind the esophagus into the mediastinum."
Infantile Amaurotic Familial Idiocy,"Delayed mental development, diminished vision, decreased muscle tone, ataxia","TaySachs disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disease that results in the destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The most common form is infantile TaySachs disease, which becomes apparent around the age of three to six months of age, with the infant losing the ability to turn over, sit, or crawl. This is then followed by seizures, hearing loss, and inability to move, with death usually occurring by the age of three to five. Less commonly, the disease may occur later in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood (juvenile or late-onset). These forms tend to be less severe, but the juvenile form typically results in death by the age of 15."
Myasthenic Syndrome,"Severe myasthenia, ptosis, fatigue, muscle atrophy, peripheral paralysis of the upper limbs, facial muscle weakness, disruption of the reflex arc, muscle soreness, myasthenic crisis, bulbar paralysis, cholinergic crisis, ophthalmoplegia","LambertEaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness of the limbs. It is also known as myasthenic syndrome, EatonLambert syndrome, and when related to cancer, carcinomatous myopathy. 
Around 60% of those with LEMS have an underlying malignancy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer (SCLC); it is therefore regarded as a paraneoplastic syndrome (a condition that arises as a result of cancer elsewhere in the body). It is the result of antibodies against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, and likely other nerve terminal proteins, in the neuromuscular junction (the connection between nerves and the muscle that they supply). The diagnosis is usually confirmed with electromyography and blood tests; these also distinguish it from myasthenia gravis, a related autoimmune neuromuscular disease."
Lafora Disease,"Seizures, ataxia, hallucinations, myoclonus, bedridden, irritability, loss of consciousness, progressive cognitive decline","Lafora disease is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disorder which results in myoclonus epilepsy and usually results in death several years after the onset of symptoms. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of inclusion bodies, known as Lafora bodies, within the cytoplasm of the cells. The Lafora bodies are in the heart, liver, muscle, and skin.:545 Lafora disease is also a neurodegenerative disease that causes impairment in the development of brain (cerebral) cortical neurons and is a glycogen metabolism disorder.
Lafora disease (LD) was described by the Spanish neuropathologist Gonzalo Rodrguez Lafora (18861971) in 1911, while directing the Neuropathology Section at the Government Hospital for Mental Insane (current NIH, US).
Lafora disease is rare, meaning it is very rare in children, adolescents and adults worldwide."
Staphylococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome,"Fever, sore throat, scarlatiniform rash, conjunctival congestion, hypotension, shock, diarrhea, elevated red blood cell hematocrit, reduced effective blood volume, faint heart sounds, signs of cardiac tamponade, syncope","Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a condition caused by bacterial toxins. Symptoms may include fever, rash, skin peeling, and low blood pressure. There may also be symptoms related to the specific underlying infection such as mastitis, osteomyelitis, necrotising fasciitis, or pneumonia.
TSS is typically caused by bacteria of the Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus type, though others may also be involved. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is sometimes referred to as toxic-shock-like syndrome (TSLS)."
Pregnancy Complicated by Rheumatoid Arthritis,"Fatigue, decreased appetite, joint stiffness, joint swelling, migratory joint pain, joint swelling, joint pain, joint rigidity, subcutaneous nodules, hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation, increased skin fragility, cough with dyspnea, and scleral congestion","Tocilizumab, sold under the brand name Actemra among others, is an immunosuppressive drug, used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, giant cell arteritis, cytokine release syndrome, COVID19, and systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD). It is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin IgG1 subclass against the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R). Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a cytokine that plays an important role in immune response and is implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, multiple myeloma and prostate cancer. Tocilizumab was jointly developed by Osaka University and Chugai, and was licensed in 2003 by Hoffmann-La Roche.
Tocilizumab was approved for medical use in the European Union in January 2009, and in the United States in January 2010."
Diabetes Mellitus in the Elderly,"Fatigue, weight loss, polyuria","Diabetes, also known as diabetes  mellitus, is a group of common endocrine diseases characterized by sustained high blood sugar levels. Diabetes is due to either the pancreas not producing enough of the hormone insulin, or the cells of the body becoming unresponsive to insulin's effects. Classic symptoms include polydipsia (excessive thirst), polyuria (excessive urination), polyphagia (excessive hunger), weight loss, and blurred vision. If left untreated, the disease can lead to various health complications, including disorders of the cardiovascular system, eye, kidney, and nerves. Diabetes accounts for approximately 4.2 million deaths every year, with an estimated 1.5 million caused by either untreated or poorly treated diabetes."
Aspergillosis,"Fever, lung infection, difficulty breathing, keratitis, fungemia, cough, productive cough, hemoptysis","Aspergillosis is a fungal infection of usually the lungs, caused by the genus Aspergillus, a common mold that is breathed in frequently from the air, but does not usually affect most people. It generally occurs in people with lung diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis or tuberculosis, or those who are immunocompromised such as those who have had a stem cell or organ transplant or those who take medications such as steroids and some cancer treatments which suppress the immune system. Rarely, it can affect skin.
Aspergillosis occurs in humans, birds and other animals. Aspergillosis occurs in chronic or acute forms which are clinically very distinct."
Carbamate Pesticide Poisoning,"Dizziness, drooling, nausea and vomiting, headache, coma, urinary and fecal incontinence, confusion, fatigue","Carbamate poisoning is poisoning due to exposure to carbamates, which are commonly sold as pesticides around the world. In most respects, it is similar to organophosphate poisoning, though typically less severe or requiring a larger amount of the chemical before symptoms appear.


== Symptoms ==
The array of symptoms typically seen in carbamate poisoning include both muscarinic and nicotinic symptoms. Muscarinic receptor effects include:

Bradycardia, or reduced heart rate
Bronchospasm, or tightening of the bronchioles of the lungs
Miosis, or constriction of the pupils
Vomiting and abdominal pain
Diarrhea
Excessive sweating and salivation
Bronchospasm is a potential life threat, especially when combined with nicotinic effects on the respiratory muscles. Bradycardia can be life-threatening in people with preexisting heart conditions."
Osteogenesis Imperfecta in Children,"Generalized floppiness, inability to stand erect normally","Osteogenesis imperfecta (IPA: ; OI), colloquially known as brittle bone disease, is a group of genetic disorders that all result in bones that break easily.:85 The range of symptomson the skeleton as well as on the body's other organsmay be mild to severe.:1512 Symptoms found in various types of OI include whites of the eye (sclerae) that are blue instead, short stature, loose joints, hearing loss, breathing problems and problems with the teeth (dentinogenesis imperfecta). Potentially life-threatening complications, all of which become more common in more severe OI, include: tearing (dissection) of the major arteries, such as the aorta;:333 pulmonary valve insufficiency secondary to distortion of the ribcage;:335341 and basilar invagination.:106107
The underlying mechanism is usually a problem with connective tissue due to a lack of, or poorly formed, type I collagen.:1513 In more than 90% of cases, OI occurs due to mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes. These mutations may be hereditary in an autosomal dominant manner but may also occur spontaneously (de novo). There are four clinically defined types: type I, the least severe; type IV, moderately severe; type III, severe and progressively deforming; and type II, perinatally lethal. As of September 2021, 19 different genes are known to cause the 21 documented genetically defined types of OI, many of which are extremely rare and have only been documented in a few individuals."
Female Urethral Cancer,"Symptoms include urethral bleeding and hematuria. Other symptoms are frequent urination, painful urination, burning sensation during urination, difficulty urinating, pain, itching, and discomfort during intercourse.","Urethral cancer is a rare cancer originating from the urethra. The disease has been classified by the TNM staging system and the World Health Organization.
Symptoms include blood in the urine, lump at end of penis, or bloody penile discharge.
Diagnosis is established by transurethral biopsy.
The most common type is papillary urothelial carcinoma."
Malignant Melanoma of the Skin,"Dark moles, skin infiltration, nodules, ulcers","Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer; it develops from the  melanin-producing cells known as melanocytes. It typically occurs in the skin, but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye (uveal melanoma). In very rare cases melanoma can also happen in the lung which is known as primary pulmonary melanoma and only happens in 0.01% of primary lung tumors.
In women, melanomas most commonly occur on the legs; while in men, on the back. Melanoma is frequently referred to as malignant melanoma."
Familial Myxovascular Fibroma,Multiple verrucous papules,"A sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that arises from cells of mesenchymal origin. Originating from mesenchymal cells means that sarcomas are cancers of connective tissues such as bone, cartilage, muscle, fat, or vascular tissues. 
Sarcomas are one of five different types of cancer, classified by the cell type from which they originate. While there are five types under this category, sarcomas are most frequently contrasted with carcinomas which are much more common. Sarcomas are quite rare, making up about 1% of all adult cancer diagnoses and 15% of childhood cancer diagnoses."
Intrauterine Fetal Death (IUFD),"Absence of fetal movements, vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain","Antithrombin III deficiency (abbreviated ATIII deficiency) is a deficiency of antithrombin III. This deficiency may be inherited or acquired. It is a rare hereditary disorder that generally comes to light when a patient suffers recurrent venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and repetitive intrauterine fetal death (IUFD). Hereditary antithrombin deficiency results in a state of increased coagulation which may lead to venous thrombosis. Inheritance is usually autosomal dominant, though a few recessive cases have been noted. The disorder was first described by Egeberg in 1965."
Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT),"Swelling, pain, cord-like structure, eczema, ulcers","Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a type of venous thrombosis involving the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein, most commonly in the legs or pelvis. A minority of DVTs occur in the arms. Symptoms can include pain, swelling, redness, and enlarged veins in the affected area, but some DVTs have no symptoms. 
The most common life-threatening concern with DVT is the potential for a clot to embolize (detach from the veins), travel as an embolus through the right side of the heart, and become lodged in a pulmonary artery that supplies blood to the lungs. This is called a pulmonary embolism (PE)."
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML),"Pale complexion, fever, fatigue, accompanied by palpitations, shortness of breath, chest and rib pain, joint pain, skin presenting with sparse, dense petechiae, lymph node enlargement.","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal cells that build up in the bone marrow and blood and interfere with normal blood cell production. Symptoms may include feeling tired, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. Occasionally, spread may occur to the brain, skin, or gums. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly, and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.
Risk factors include getting older, being male, smoking, previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy, myelodysplastic syndrome, and exposure to the chemical benzene."
Localized Pleural Mesothelioma,"Cough, Atelectasis, Heaviness in the chest, Shortness of breath, Unexplained fever, Joint stiffness, Joint pain","Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium). The area most commonly affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding each testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly."
Cystitis Glandularis,"Hematuria, urinary frequency with urgency and dysuria, prostate hypertrophy, mucoid urine","Cystitis glandularis is the transformation of mucosal cells lining the urinary bladder. They undergo glandular metaplasia, a process in which irritated tissues take on a different form, in this case that of a gland. The main importance is in the findings of test results, in this case histopathology.  They must distinguish a benign metaplastic change from the cancerous condition urothelial cell carcinoma. It is a very common finding in bladder biopsies and cystectomies, and most often found in the trigone area."
Pediatric Acute Renal Failure,"Oliguria or Anuria, Decreased Appetite, Abnormal Heartbeat","Acute kidney injury (AKI), previously called acute renal failure (ARF), is a sudden decrease in kidney function that develops within seven days, as shown by an increase in serum creatinine or a decrease in urine output, or both.
Causes of AKI are classified as either prerenal (due to decreased blood flow to the kidney), intrinsic renal (due to damage to the kidney itself), or postrenal (due to blockage of urine flow). Prerenal causes of AKI include sepsis, dehydration, excessive blood loss, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, cirrhosis, and certain medications like ACE inhibitors or NSAIDs. Intrinsic renal causes of AKI include glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, certain antibiotics, and chemotherapeutic agents. Postrenal causes of AKI include kidney stones, bladder cancer, neurogenic bladder, enlargement of the prostate, narrowing of the urethra, and certain medications like anticholinergics."
Open Head Injury,"Scalp laceration, bleeding, coma","A head injury is any injury that results in trauma to the skull or brain. The terms traumatic brain injury and head injury are often used interchangeably in the medical literature. Because head injuries cover such a broad scope of injuries, there are many causesincluding accidents, falls, physical assault, or traffic accidentsthat can cause head injuries.
The number of new cases is 1.7 million in the United States each year, with about 3% of these incidents leading to death. Adults have head injuries more frequently than any age group resulting from falls, motor vehicle crashes, colliding or being struck by an object, or assaults."
Bone Tumor,"Pain, vascular murmur, anemia, lung metastasis","A bone tumor is an abnormal growth of tissue in bone, traditionally classified as noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). Cancerous bone tumors usually originate from a cancer in another part of the body such as from lung, breast, thyroid, kidney and prostate.  There may be a lump, pain, or neurological signs from pressure. A bone tumor might present with a pathologic fracture. Other symptoms may include fatigue, fever, weight loss, anemia and nausea."
Uterine Sarcoma,"Abdominal pain, menstrual disorders, abnormal vaginal bleeding, abdominal mass, increased vaginal discharge, weight loss, anemia, fever, general debility, pelvic mass infiltrating the pelvic wall","The uterine sarcomas form a group of malignant tumors that arises from the smooth muscle or connective tissue of the uterus. They can be difficult to detect, as symptoms are common to other uterine conditions and no specific screening test has been developed. This presents an issue for treatment, as the cancer spreads quickly.
Uterine sarcoma is rare and mostly occurs in post-menopausal women. The most common type, leiomyosarcoma, is twice as common in Black women as it is in white women."
Recurrent Aseptic Meningitis,"Signs of meningeal irritation, nausea and vomiting, headache, myalgia, irregular breathing, coma, febrile illness","Mollaret's meningitis is a recurrent or chronic inflammation of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known collectively as the meninges. Since Mollaret's meningitis is a recurrent, benign (non-cancerous), aseptic meningitis, it is also referred to as benign recurrent lymphocytic meningitis. It was named for Pierre Mollaret, the French neurologist who first described it in 1944.
Although chronic meningitis has been defined as ""irritation and inflammation of the meninges persisting for more than 4 weeks being associated with pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid"", cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities may not be detectable for the entire time.  Diagnosis can be elusive, as Helbok et al."
Giant Hypertrophic Gastritis,"Upper abdominal pain, decreased appetite, nausea and vomiting, weight loss, steatorrhea, edema, weakness, cachexia, hypoproteinemia","Mntrier disease is a rare, acquired, premalignant disease of the stomach characterized by massive gastric folds, gastric hyperplasia, excessive mucus production with resultant protein loss, and little or no acid production (achlorhydria). The disorder is associated with excessive secretion of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-). It is named after French physician Pierre Eugne Mntrier (18591935).


== Signs and symptoms ==
Individuals with the disease present with upper abdominal (epigastric) pain, at times accompanied by nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, edema, weakness, and weight loss.  A small amount of gastrointestinal bleeding may occur, which is typically due to superficial mucosal erosions; large volume bleeding is rare."
Acute Orbital Cellulitis,"Axial proptosis, conjunctival edema, limitation of eye movement, severe pain and tenderness in the eye area","Orbital cellulitis  is inflammation of eye tissues behind the orbital septum. It is most commonly caused by an acute spread of infection into the eye socket from either the adjacent sinuses or through the blood. It may also occur after trauma.  When it affects the rear of the eye, it is known as retro-orbital cellulitis.
Without proper treatment, orbital cellulitis may lead to serious consequences, including permanent loss of vision or even death."
Necrobiosis Lipoidica,"Soft, yellow, slightly raised plaques, low fever, convulsions, drowsiness, severe anemia, hepatomegaly, enlarged liver, bilateral renal enlargement, and reduced kidney function","Necrobiosis Lipoidica is a rare, chronic skin condition predominantly associated with diabetes mellitus (known as necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum or NLD). It can occur in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis or without any underlying conditions (idiopathic) and can also be displayed in patients with obesity, hypertension, celiac disease, and metabolic syndrome. About a quarter of Necrobiosis Lipoidica is associated with diabetes mellitus.
The broader overarching definition of necrobiosis is a gradual physiological death of a cell. It can be caused by basophilia, erythema, or a tumor."
Ataxia-telangiectasia Type I in Children,"Ataxia, nystagmus, intention tremor, pigment loss, skin atrophy, hyperpigmentation","Ataxiatelangiectasia (AT or AT), also referred to as ataxiatelangiectasia syndrome or LouisBar syndrome, is a rare, neurodegenerative disease causing severe disability. Ataxia refers to poor coordination and telangiectasia to small dilated blood vessels, both of which are hallmarks of the disease. AT affects many parts of the body:

It impairs certain areas of the brain including the cerebellum, causing difficulty with movement and coordination.
It weakens the immune system, causing a predisposition to infection.
It prevents the repair of broken DNA, increasing the risk of cancer."
Heart Disease,"Tachycardia, cachexia, chest pain, syncope, nausea, transient loss of consciousness, cyanosis, suffocation, palpitations","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is any disease involving the heart or blood vessels. CVDs constitute a class of diseases that includes: coronary artery diseases (e.g. angina, heart attack), heart failure, hypertensive heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease, carditis, aortic aneurysms, peripheral artery disease, thromboembolic disease, and venous thrombosis.
The underlying mechanisms vary depending on the disease. It is estimated that dietary risk factors are associated with 53% of CVD deaths."

The course teaches healthcare providers how to assess injured and sick children and recognize and treat respiratory distress/failure, shock, cardiac arrest, and arrhythmias.


== Basic Life Support (BLS) ==

PALS builds upon AHA's Pediatric Basic Life Support (BLS). Providers should follow the AHA's Pediatric BLS Algorithms for single and  2 person rescuer. The most essential component of BLS and PALS cardiac arrest care is high quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)."
Dilated Cardiomyopathy,"Shortness of breath, fatigue, difficulty breathing","Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition in which the heart becomes enlarged and cannot pump blood effectively. Symptoms vary from none to feeling tired, leg swelling, and shortness of breath. It may also result in chest pain or fainting. Complications can include heart failure, heart valve disease, or an irregular heartbeat.
Causes include genetics, alcohol, cocaine, certain toxins, complications of pregnancy, and certain infections."
Sturge-Weber Syndrome,"Seizures, port-wine stains, hemiparesis, hemiatrophy, glaucoma, and proptosis with vision impairment.","SturgeWeber syndrome, sometimes referred to as encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis, is a rare congenital neurocutaneous disorder (also known as phakomatoses). It is often associated with port-wine stains of the face, glaucoma, seizures, intellectual disability, and ipsilateral leptomeningeal angioma (cerebral malformations and tumors). SturgeWeber syndrome can be classified into three different types. Type 1 includes facial and leptomeningeal angiomas as well as the possibility of glaucoma or choroidal lesions. Normally, only one side of the brain is affected."
Central Chondrosarcoma,"Extraosseous mass, deep non-intense and non-continuous pain","Chondrosarcoma is a bone sarcoma, a primary cancer composed of cells derived from transformed cells that produce cartilage. A chondrosarcoma is a member of a category of tumors of bone and soft tissue known as sarcomas.  About 30% of bone sarcomas are chondrosarcomas. It is resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Unlike other primary bone sarcomas that mainly affect children and adolescents, a chondrosarcoma can present at any age."
Vaginal Endometrial Stromal Sarcoma,"Vaginal bleeding, anal prolapse, increased vaginal discharge, lower abdominal distension, difficulty in defecation","Endometrial cancer is a cancer that arises from the endometrium (the lining of the uterus or womb). It is the result of the abnormal growth of cells that can invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause."
Acral lentiginous melanoma,"Skin darkening, Skin desquamation","Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is a type of skin cancer. It typically begins as a uniform brownish mark before becoming darker and wider with a blurred, irregular border. ALM is most frequently seen on the foot of a person with darker skin but can also be found in non-sun exposed areas such as the palms, soles, and under finger and toenails. It may become bumpy and ulcerate. When under the nail it typically appears as dark longitudinal streaks."
Pediatric Acute Hemiplegia,"Seizures, disturbance of consciousness, facial nerve paralysis, loss of tendon reflexes, dysphagia, abdominal pain accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fever with abdominal pain","Hemiparesis, also called unilateral paresis, is the weakness of one entire side of the body (hemi- means ""half""). Hemiplegia, in its most severe form, is the complete paralysis of one entire side of the body. Either hemiparesis or hemiplegia can result from a variety of medical causes, including congenital conditions, trauma, tumors, traumatic brain injury and stroke.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Different types of hemiparesis can impair different bodily functions.  Some effects, such as weakness or partial paralysis of a limb on the affected side, are generally always to be expected."
Endocardial Fibroelastosis in Children,"Irritability, pallor, coughing, shortness of breath in newborns, cyanosis, abnormal heart sounds, respiratory failure, hepatomegaly, vomiting, heart failure, cold sweats, refusal to eat","Endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) is a rare heart disorder usually occurring in children two years old and younger. It may also be considered a reaction to stress, not necessarily a specific disease.
It should not be confused with endomyocardial fibrosis.


== Signs and symptoms ==
EFE is characterized by a thickening of the innermost lining of the heart chambers (the endocardium) due to an increase in the amount of supporting connective tissue and elastic fibres. It is an uncommon cause of unexplained heart failure in infants and children, and is one component of HEC syndrome."
Chronic Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID),"Lower abdominal pain, a feeling of heaviness in the abdomen after defecation, increased vaginal discharge, back pain, abnormal urination, menstrual disorders","Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), also known as pelvic inflammatory disorder, is an infection of the upper part of the female reproductive system, mainly the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often, there may be no symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present, may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, bleeding after sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long-term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.
The disease is caused by bacteria that spread from the vagina and cervix."
Cerebral Hemorrhage in the Elderly,"Dizziness, headache, impaired limb mobility","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), also known as hemorrhagic stroke, is a sudden bleeding into the tissues of the brain (i.e. the parenchyma), into its ventricles, or into both. An ICH is a type of bleeding within the skull and one kind of stroke (ischemic stroke being the other). Symptoms can vary dramatically depending on the severity (how much blood), acuity (over what timeframe), and location (anatomically) but can include headache, one-sided weakness, numbness, tingling, or paralysis, speech problems, vision or hearing problems, memory loss, attention problems, coordination problems, balance problems, dizziness or lightheadedness or vertigo, nausea/vomiting, seizures, decreased level of consciousness or total loss of consciousness, neck stiffness, and fever.
Hemorrhagic stroke may occur on the background of alterations to the blood vessels in the brain, such as cerebral arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral arteriovenous malformation, brain trauma, brain tumors and an intracranial aneurysm, which can cause intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage."
Ectopic and Accessory Renal Vessels,"Hematuria, back pain, pyuria, nausea and vomiting","Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a kidney cancer that originates in the lining of the proximal convoluted tubule, a part of the very small tubes in the kidney that transport primary urine. RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, responsible for approximately 9095% of cases. It is more common in men (with a male-to-female ratio of up to 2:1). It is most commonly diagnosed in the elderly (especially in people over 75 years of age).
Initial treatment is most commonly either partial or complete removal of the affected kidney(s)."
Gynecomastia in Adolescent Males,"Palmar erythema, abdominal masses, spider nevi","Gynecomastia (also spelled gynaecomastia) is the non-cancerous enlargement of one or both breasts in men due to the growth of breast tissue as a result of a hormone imbalance between estrogens and androgens. Physically speaking, gynecomastia is completely benign, but it is associated with significant psychological distress, social stigma, and dysphoria.
Gynecomastia can be normal in newborn male babies due to exposure to estrogen from the mother, in adolescent boys going through puberty, in older men over the age of 50, and in obese men. Most occurrences of gynecomastia do not require diagnostic tests. Gynecomastia may be caused by abnormal hormone changes, any condition that leads to an increase in the ratio of estrogens/androgens such as liver disease, kidney failure, thyroid disease and some non-breast tumors."

Suicide attempts do not always result in death, and a non-fatal suicide attempt can leave the person with serious physical injuries, long-term health problems, or brain damage.
Worldwide, three suicide methods predominate, with the pattern varying in different countries: these are hanging, pesticides, and firearms. Some suicides may be preventable by removing the means. Making common suicide methods less accessible leads to an overall reduction in the number of suicides."
Arterial Embolism,"Intermittent claudication, lower back pain, buttock pain, iliac fossa pain, calf peroneal muscle pain and tenderness, skin thinning and shininess, osteoporosis, muscle atrophy, hair loss, resting pain, cyanosis, and leg ulcers.","Arterial embolism is a sudden interruption of blood flow to an organ or body part due to an embolus adhering to the wall of an artery blocking the flow of blood, the major type of embolus being a blood clot (thromboembolism). Sometimes, pulmonary embolism is classified as arterial embolism as well, in the sense that the clot follows the pulmonary artery carrying deoxygenated blood away from the heart. However, pulmonary embolism is generally classified as a form of venous embolism, because the embolus forms in veins. Arterial embolism is the major cause of infarction (which may also be caused by e.g. arterial compression, rupture or pathological vasoconstriction)."
Compartment Syndrome,"Deep subcutaneous fascial progressive necrotizing infection, body pain, neck and shoulder pain, joint pain, lower leg or forearm compartment syndrome, fascial pain","Compartment syndrome is a serious medical condition in which increased pressure within a body compartment compromises blood flow and tissue function, potentially leading to permanent damage if not promptly treated. There are two types: acute and chronic. Acute compartment syndrome can lead to a loss of the affected limb due to tissue death.
Symptoms of acute compartment syndrome (ACS) include severe pain, decreased blood flow, decreased movement, numbness, and a pale limb. It is most often due to physical trauma, like a bone fracture (up to 75% of cases) or a crush injury."
Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis,"fever, fatigue, depression, poor appetite, weight loss, joint pain, night sweats, urine color change","Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), after Nazi German physician Friedrich Wegener, is a rare, long-term, systemic disorder that involves the formation of granulomas and inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis). It is an autoimmune disease and a form of vasculitis that affects small- and medium-sized vessels in many organs, but most commonly affects the upper respiratory tract, lungs, and kidneys. The signs and symptoms of GPA are highly varied and reflect which organs are supplied by the affected blood vessels. Typical signs and symptoms include nosebleeds, stuffy nose and crustiness of nasal secretions, and inflammation of the uveal layer of the eye.  Damage to the heart, lungs, and kidneys can be fatal."
Tuberculosis,"Cough, hemoptysis, fever, night sweats, and gradual weight loss, etc.","Tuberculosis (TB), also known colloquially as the ""white death"", or historically as consumption, is a contagious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteria. Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections show no symptoms, in which case it is known as inactive or latent tuberculosis. A small proportion of latent infections progress to active disease that, if left untreated, can be fatal. Typical symptoms of active TB are chronic cough with blood-containing mucus, fever, night sweats, and weight loss."
Keratosis Pilaris,"Papules, itching, severe pain","Keratosis pilaris  (KP; also follicular keratosis, lichen pilaris, or colloquially chicken skin.) is a common, autosomal-dominant, genetic condition of the skin's hair follicles characterized by the appearance of possibly itchy, small, gooseflesh-like bumps, with varying degrees of reddening or inflammation. It most often appears on the outer sides of the upper arms (the forearms can also be affected), thighs, face, back, and buttocks; KP can also occur on the hands, and tops of legs, sides, or any body part except glabrous (hairless) skin (like the palms or soles of feet). Often the lesions can appear on the face, which may be mistaken for acne or folliculitis.
The several types of KP have been associated with pregnancy, type 1 diabetes mellitus, obesity, dry skin, allergic diseases (e.g., atopic dermatitis), and rarely cancer. Many rarer types of the disorder are part of inherited genetic syndromes."

A small proportion of latent infections progress to active disease that, if left untreated, can be fatal. Typical symptoms of active TB are chronic cough with blood-containing mucus, fever, night sweats, and weight loss."
Anterior Vaginal Wall Prolapse,"Frequent urination, protrusion in the vaginal wall, and a feeling of heaviness in the lower abdomen","Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is characterized by descent of pelvic organs from their normal positions into the vagina. In women, the condition usually occurs when the pelvic floor collapses after gynecological cancer treatment, childbirth or heavy lifting. Injury incurred to fascia membranes and other connective structures can result in cystocele, rectocele or both. Treatment can involve dietary and lifestyle changes, physical therapy, or surgery.

There are multiple types of neurogenic bladder depending on the underlying cause and the symptoms. Symptoms include overactive bladder, urinary urgency, frequency, incontinence or difficulty passing urine. A range of diseases or conditions can cause neurogenic bladder including spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, stroke, brain injury, spina bifida, peripheral nerve damage, Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy or other neurodegenerative diseases. Neurogenic bladder can be diagnosed through a history and physical as well as imaging and more specialized testing."
Esophageal Mucosal Injury,"Foreign body sensation in the throat, cough, difficulty swallowing, odynophagia (painful swallowing), nausea and vomiting, pain behind the sternum, burning pain behind the sternum, vomiting, high fever","Esophageal cancer (American English) or oesophageal cancer (British English) is cancer arising from the esophagusthe food pipe that runs between the throat and the stomach. Symptoms often include difficulty in swallowing and weight loss. Other symptoms may include pain when swallowing, a hoarse voice, enlarged lymph nodes (""glands"") around the collarbone, a dry cough, and possibly coughing up or vomiting blood.
The two main sub-types of the disease are esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (often abbreviated to ESCC), which is more common in the developing world, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which is more common in the developed world. A number of less common types also occur."
Firearm-related Cranial Injury,"Headache, bleeding, dizziness, vomiting","A gunshot wound (GSW) is a penetrating injury caused by a projectile (e.g. a bullet) shot from a gun (typically a firearm). Damage may include bleeding, bone fractures, organ damage, wound infection, and loss of the ability to move part of the body. Damage depends on the part of the body hit, the path the bullet follows through (or into) the body, and the type and speed of the bullet. In severe cases, although not uncommon, the injury is fatal."
Pediatric Intestinal Malrotation,"Sepsis, Hematochezia, Peritonitis, Abdominal Pain, Diarrhea, Abdominal Distension, Melena, Chronic Abdominal Pain","Intestinal malrotation is a congenital anomaly of rotation of the midgut. It occurs during the first trimester as the fetal gut undergoes a complex series of growth and development. Malrotation can lead to a dangerous complication called volvulus, in which cases emergency surgery is indicated. Malrotation can refer to a spectrum of abnormal intestinal positioning, often including:

The small intestine found predominantly on the right side of the abdomen
The cecum displaced from its usual position in the right lower quadrant into the epigastrium or right hypochondrium
An absent or displaced ligament of Treitz
Fibrous peritoneal bands called bands of Ladd running across the vertical portion of the duodenum
An unusually narrow, stalk-like mesentery
The position of the intestines, narrow mesentery and Ladd's bands can contribute to several severe gastrointestinal conditions. The narrow mesentery predisposes some cases of malrotation to midgut volvulus, a twisting of the entire small bowel that can obstruct the mesenteric blood vessels leading to intestinal ischemia, necrosis, and death if not promptly treated."
Fulminant Hepatic Failure,"Hepatic facies, palmar erythema, spider angiomas, progressive hepatic shrinkage, hiccups, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, irritability, epistaxis, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, ascites, tendency to bleed","Acute liver failure is the appearance of severe complications rapidly after the first signs (such as jaundice) of liver disease, and indicates that the liver has sustained severe damage (loss of function of 8090% of liver cells). The complications are hepatic encephalopathy and impaired protein synthesis (as measured by the levels of serum albumin and the prothrombin time in the blood). The 1993 classification defines hyperacute as within 1 week, acute as 828 days, and subacute as 412 weeks; both the speed with which the disease develops and the underlying cause strongly affect outcomes.


== Signs and symptoms ==
The main features of acute liver failure are rapid-onset jaundice, weakness, and eventually, changes in mental status that can begin as mild confusion but progress to coma, known as hepatic encephalopathy.


=== Encephalopathy and cerebral edema ===
In ALF, hepatic encephalopathy leads to cerebral edema, coma, brain herniation, and eventually death."
Acute Right-Sided Heart Failure,"Hypotension, tachycardia, shock, extremities that are cold and damp, diaphoresis, distension of the jugular veins, hepatic congestion, pain in the right upper quadrant, cyanosis, positive hepatojugular reflux, reduced cardiac reserve, abdominal pain","Heart failure (HF), also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), is a syndrome caused by an impairment in the heart's ability to fill with and pump blood.
Although symptoms vary based on which side of the heart is affected, HF typically presents with shortness of breath, excessive fatigue, and bilateral leg swelling. The severity of the heart failure is mainly decided based on ejection fraction and also measured by the severity of symptoms. Other conditions that have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver disease, anemia, and thyroid disease.
Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excessive alcohol consumption, infection, and cardiomyopathy."
Cervical Carcinoma In Situ,"Irregular vaginal bleeding, increased vaginal discharge, backache, persistent pain in the sacral and iliac areas","Carcinoma in situ (CIS) is a group of abnormal cells. While they are a form of neoplasm, there is disagreement over whether CIS should be classified as cancer. This controversy also depends on the exact CIS in question (e.g., cervical, skin, breast). Some authors do not classify them as cancer, however, recognizing that they can potentially become cancer. Others classify certain types as a non-invasive form of cancer."
Diabetes Mellitus,"Weight loss, urine as dark as strong tea, dribbling urination, cloudy urine, thick gelatinous substances in urine","Diabetes, also known as diabetes  mellitus, is a group of common endocrine diseases characterized by sustained high blood sugar levels. Diabetes is due to either the pancreas not producing enough of the hormone insulin, or the cells of the body becoming unresponsive to insulin's effects. Classic symptoms include polydipsia (excessive thirst), polyuria (excessive urination), polyphagia (excessive hunger), weight loss, and blurred vision. If left untreated, the disease can lead to various health complications, including disorders of the cardiovascular system, eye, kidney, and nerves. Diabetes accounts for approximately 4.2 million deaths every year, with an estimated 1.5 million caused by either untreated or poorly treated diabetes."
Salivary Gland Tumor,"Mass, localized pain, facial paralysis, tongue numbness, hypoglossal nerve paralysis","Salivary gland tumours, or neoplasms, are tumours that form in the tissues of salivary glands. The salivary glands are classified as major or minor. The major salivary glands consist of the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. The minor salivary glands consist of 800 to 1000 small mucus-secreting glands located throughout the lining of the oral cavity. People with these types of tumours may be asymptomatic."
Neonatal Hepatitis Syndrome,"Jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, dark yellow urine similar to strong tea, pale stools, vomiting, anorexia in infants, slow weight gain in infants","Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue. Some people or animals with hepatitis have no symptoms, whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hepatitis is acute if it resolves within six months, and chronic if it lasts longer than six months. Acute hepatitis can resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or (rarely) result in acute liver failure. Chronic hepatitis may progress to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer."
Breast Cancer Skin Metastasis,"Red patches on the breast skin and adjacent skin, hardening, elevated local temperature, vesicles, asymptomatic nodules, which may form ulcers, pigmentation","Metastasis is a pathogenic agent's spreading from an initial or primary site to a different or secondary site within the host's body; the term is typically used when referring to metastasis by a cancerous tumor.  The newly pathological sites, then, are metastases (mets). It is generally distinguished from cancer invasion, which is the direct extension and penetration by cancer cells into neighboring tissues.
Cancer occurs after cells are genetically altered to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. This uncontrolled proliferation by mitosis produces a primary heterogeneic tumour."
Gastric Sarcoma,"Stomach pain, abdominal discomfort, bloating, rectal bleeding, vomiting blood, weight loss, anemia, fatigue","The following is a list of cancer types. Cancer is a group of diseases that involve abnormal increases in the number of cells, with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors or lumps are cancerous; benign tumors are not classified as being cancer because they do not spread to other parts of the body. There are over 100 different known cancers that affect humans.
Cancers are often described by the body part that they originated in."
Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"Cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, cachexia, poor appetite, listlessness","Squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung is a histologic type of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). It is the second most prevalent type of lung cancer after lung adenocarcinoma and it originates in the bronchi. Its tumor cells are characterized by a squamous appearance, similar to the one observed in epidermal cells. Squamous-cell carcinoma of the lung is strongly associated with tobacco smoking, more than any other forms of NSCLC.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Squamous-cell lung carcinoma share most of the signs and symptoms with other forms of lung cancer. These include worsening cough, including hemoptysis, chest pain, shortness of breath and weight loss."
Congenital Giant Pigmented Nevus,"The nevus often appears darker in color, typically brown-black or black, with a palpable infiltration above the skin surface. The surface may contain small papillary nodules, exhibiting verrucous proliferation. The hair growing from the nevus is usually coarser, darker, and more abundant than normal.","A melanocytic nevus (also known as nevocytic nevus, nevus-cell nevus, and commonly as a mole) is usually a noncancerous condition of pigment-producing skin cells. It is a type of melanocytic tumor that contains nevus cells. A mole can be either subdermal (under the skin) or a pigmented growth on the skin, formed mostly of a type of cell known as a melanocyte. The high concentration of the body's pigmenting agent, melanin, is responsible for their dark color. Moles are a member of the family of skin lesions known as nevi (singular ""nevus""), occurring commonly in humans."
Leukemoid Reaction,"Enlargement of liver, spleen, lymph nodes and bleeding symptoms such as skin petechiae","The term leukemoid reaction describes an increased
white blood cell count (> 50,000 cells/L), which is a physiological response to stress or infection (as opposed to a primary blood malignancy, such as leukemia). It often describes the presence of immature cells such as myeloblasts or red blood cells with nuclei in the peripheral blood.
It may be lymphoid or myeloid.


== Causes ==
As noted above, a leukemoid reaction is typically a response to an underlying medical issue. Causes of leukemoid reactions include:

Severe hemorrhage (retroperitoneal hemorrhage)
Drugs
Use of sulfa drugs
Use of dapsone
Use of glucocorticoids
Use of G-CSF or related growth factors
All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)
Ethylene glycol intoxication
Infections
Clostridioides difficile
Tuberculosis
Pertussis
Infectious mononucleosis (lymphocyte predominant)
Visceral larva migrans (eosinophil predominant)
Asplenia
Diabetic ketoacidosis
Organ necrosis
Hepatic necrosis
Ischemic colitis
As a feature of trisomy 21 in infancy (incidence of ~10%)
As a paraneoplastic phenomenon (rare)


== Diagnosis ==
Conventionally, a leukocytosis exceeding 50,000 WBC/mm3 with a significant increase in early neutrophil precursors is referred to as a leukemoid reaction."
Pediatric Adult-type Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia,"Severe bone and joint pain, bleeding, unexplained high fever","Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), also known as chronic myeloid leukemia, is a cancer of the white blood cells. It is a form of leukemia characterized by the increased and unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of these cells in the blood. CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) and their precursors is found; characteristic increase in basophils is clinically relevant. It is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome.
CML is largely treated with targeted drugs called tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which have led to dramatically improved long-term survival rates since 2001."
Aspergillosis,"Fever, lung infection, difficulty breathing, keratitis, fungemia, cough, productive cough, hemoptysis","Aspergillosis is a fungal infection of usually the lungs, caused by the genus Aspergillus, a common mold that is breathed in frequently from the air, but does not usually affect most people. It generally occurs in people with lung diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis or tuberculosis, or those who are immunocompromised such as those who have had a stem cell or organ transplant or those who take medications such as steroids and some cancer treatments which suppress the immune system. Rarely, it can affect skin.
Aspergillosis occurs in humans, birds and other animals. Aspergillosis occurs in chronic or acute forms which are clinically very distinct."
Kidney Deficiency,"Soreness and weakness of the waist and knees, fatigue, shortness of breath, reluctance to speak, aversion to cold with cold limbs, premature ejaculation","Magnesium deficiency is an electrolyte disturbance in which there is a low level of magnesium in the body. Symptoms include tremor, poor coordination, muscle spasms, loss of appetite, personality changes, and nystagmus. Complications may include seizures or cardiac arrest such as from torsade de pointes. Those with low magnesium often have low potassium.
Causes include low dietary intake, alcoholism, diarrhea, increased urinary loss, and poor absorption from the intestines."
Retinoblastoma,"Visual impairment, eye pain, increased intraocular pressure, strabismus, fundus changes, headache, conjunctival congestion, pale yellow pupil reflex","Retinoblastoma (Rb) is a rare form of cancer that rapidly develops from the immature cells of a retina, the light-detecting tissue of the eye. It is the most common primary malignant intraocular cancer in children, and 80% of retinoblastoma cases are first detected in those under 3 years old.
Though most children in high income countries survive this cancer, they may lose their vision in the affected eye(s) or need to have the eye removed.
Almost half of children with retinoblastoma have a hereditary genetic defect associated with it. In other cases, retinoblastoma is caused by a congenital mutation in the chromosome 13 gene 13q14 (retinoblastoma protein)."
Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,"Frequent urination, difficulty urinating, urinary retention, thinning or interruption of urine stream, dysuria with hematuria, urinary incontinence, enlarged prostate, post-micturition dribble, acute urinary retention, incomplete bladder emptying, increased post-void residual urine, and lingering dribble.","Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also called prostate enlargement, is a noncancerous increase in size of the prostate gland. Symptoms may include frequent urination, trouble starting to urinate, weak stream, inability to urinate, or loss of bladder control. Complications can include urinary tract infections, bladder stones, and chronic kidney problems.
The cause is unclear. Risk factors include a family history, obesity, type 2 diabetes, not enough exercise, and erectile dysfunction."
Cerebral Venous Malformation,"Epilepsy and epileptic seizures, sensory disturbances, chronic headaches, intracranial hemorrhage, hemiplegia, coma, unstable gait, ventricular hemorrhage, mild paralysis, severe headaches","Cavernous hemangioma, also called cavernous angioma, venous malformation, or cavernoma, is a type of venous malformation due to endothelial dysmorphogenesis from a lesion which is present at birth. A cavernoma in the brain is called a cerebral cavernous malformation or CCM.  Despite its designation as a hemangioma, a cavernous hemangioma is a benign (but not harmless) condition, not a malignant tumor, as it does not display endothelial hyperplasia. The abnormal tissue causes a slowing of blood flow through the cavities, or ""caverns"". The blood vessels do not form the necessary junctions with surrounding cells, and the structural support from the smooth muscle is hindered, causing leakage into the surrounding tissue. It is the leakage of blood (hemorrhage) that causes a variety of symptoms known to be associated with the condition."
Acute Granulocytic Leukemia,"Anemia, fever, bleeding in the skin, gingiva, oral cavity, and nasal mucosa, tenderness under the sternum, greenish masses in the orbit, headache, vomiting, seizures, blurred vision, papilledema","Myeloid leukemia is a type of leukemia affecting myeloid tissue.
Types include:

Acute myeloid leukemia: A cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, characterized by the rapid growth of myeloblasts that build up in the bone marrow and blood and interfere with normal blood cell production.
Chronic myelogenous leukemia: A cancer of the white blood cells.
Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia: A life-threatening leukemia in which malignant megakaryoblasts proliferate abnormally and injure various tissues.
Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm: A rare hematologic malignancy which is a malignancy of plasmacytoid dendritic cells."
Acute Hydrogen Sulfide Poisoning,"Tearing, eye pain, sore throat, headache, upper respiratory tract mucosa irritation symptoms, rales, nausea and vomiting, dry throat and burning sensation, conjunctival edema and corneal ulcer, dizziness, fatigue, conjunctival congestion","Hydrogen sulfide is a chemical compound with the formula H2S. It is a colorless chalcogen-hydride gas, and is toxic, corrosive, and flammable. Trace amounts in ambient atmosphere have a characteristic foul odor of rotten eggs.  Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele is credited with having discovered the chemical composition of purified hydrogen sulfide in 1777.
Hydrogen sulfide is toxic to humans and most other animals by inhibiting cellular respiration in a manner similar to hydrogen cyanide. When it is inhaled or its salts are ingested in high amounts, damage to organs occurs rapidly with symptoms ranging from breathing difficulties to convulsions and death."
Anaphylactic Shock,"Fear, palpitations, restlessness, hypotension, nausea and vomiting, abnormal sweating, itching, wheal-like lesions at the scratched areas, vesicles, abnormal breathing, systemic allergic reactions, diarrhea","Anaphylaxis (Greek: ana- 'up' + phylaxis 'guarding') is a serious, potentially fatal allergic reaction and medical emergency that is rapid in onset and requires immediate medical attention regardless of the use of emergency medication on site. It typically causes more than one of the following: an itchy rash, throat closing due to swelling that can obstruct or stop breathing; severe tongue swelling that can also interfere with or stop breathing; shortness of breath, vomiting, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, low blood pressure, and medical shock. 
These symptoms typically start in minutes to hours and then increase very rapidly to life-threatening levels. Urgent medical treatment is required to prevent serious harm and death, even if the patient has used an epinephrine autoinjector or has taken other medications in response, and even if symptoms appear to be improving.


== Cause, mechanism, and diagnosis ==
Common causes include allergies to insect bites and stings, allergies to foodsincluding nuts, milk, fish, shellfish, eggs and some fresh fruits or dried fruits; allergies to sulfitesa class of food preservatives and a byproduct in some fermented foods like vinegar; allergies to medications  including some antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin; allergy to general anaesthetic (used to make people sleep during surgery); allergy to contrast agents  dyes used in some medical tests to help certain areas of the body show up better on scans; allergy to latex  a type of rubber found in some rubber gloves and condoms."
Micrognathia Syndrome,"Difficulty in breathing, malnutrition, cyanosis, cachexia, mandibular protrusion deformity, abnormal respiration, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), neonatal cyanosis, neonatal stridor, micrognathia, 'fan-shaped' bone destruction in the jaw, sound when opening the mouth due to jaw bone","Splenogonadal fusion-limb defects-micrognathia syndrome, also known by its abbreviation, SGFLD syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal fusion of the spleen and the gonad (splenogonadal fusion) alongside limb defects and orofacial anomalies. It is a type of syndromic dysostosis.
Children with this condition typically have abnormal fusion of the spleen and the gonad, amelia (or any kind of severe shortening of a limb), microglossia, cleft palate, bifid uvula, micrognathia. Additional symptoms include cryptorchidism, anal stenosis, anal atresia, pulmonary hypoplasia, and congenital heart defects.
This condition is highly fatal, fetuses/children with this condition are more likely to either be stillborn or die in infancy."
Traumatic pneumothorax,"Dyspnea, pneumothorax, shock, cyanosis, multiple rib fractures, rapid thin pulse","A pneumothorax is collection of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. In a minority of cases, a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, and the amount of air in the space between chest wall and lungs increases; this is called a tension pneumothorax. This can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. This leads to a type of shock called obstructive shock, which can be fatal unless reversed."
Ovarian Clear Cell Carcinoma,"Abdominal mass, bloating, infertility history in half of the patients, menstrual irregularity or postmenopausal bleeding","Ovarian clear-cell carcinoma, or clear-cell carcinoma of the ovary, also called ovarian clear-cell adenocarcinoma, is one of several subtypes of ovarian carcinoma  a subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer, in contrast to non-epithelial cancers. According to research, most ovarian cancers start at the epithelial layer which is the lining of the ovary. Within this epithelial group ovarian clear-cell carcinoma makes up 510%. 
It was recognized as a separate category of ovarian cancer by the World Health Organization in 1973. Its incidence rate differs across various ethnic groups."
Hypertensive Intracerebral Hemorrhage,"Sudden headache, vertigo, vomiting, hemiplegia, aphasia, and disturbances in consciousness","Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), also known as intracranial bleed, is bleeding within the skull. Subtypes are intracerebral bleeds (intraventricular bleeds and intraparenchymal bleeds), subarachnoid bleeds, epidural bleeds, and subdural bleeds.
Intracerebral bleeding affects 2.5 per 10,000 people each year.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Intracranial hemorrhage is a serious medical emergency because the buildup of blood within the skull can lead to increases in intracranial pressure, which can crush delicate brain tissue or limit its blood supply.  Severe increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) can cause brain herniation, in which parts of the brain are squeezed past structures in the skull."
Neglect Syndrome,"Hemispatial neglect, Vertical neglect, Sensory disturbances, Spatial neglect, Hemianopia, Motor neglect","Hemispatial neglect is a neuropsychological condition in which, after damage to one hemisphere of the brain (e.g. after a stroke), a deficit in attention and awareness towards the side of space opposite brain damage (contralesional space) is observed. It is defined by the inability of a person to process and perceive stimuli towards the contralesional side of the body or environment. Hemispatial neglect is very commonly contralateral to the damaged hemisphere, but instances of ipsilesional neglect (on the same side as the lesion) have been reported.


== Presentation ==
Hemispatial neglect results most commonly from strokes and brain unilateral injury to the right cerebral hemisphere, with rates in the critical stage of up to 80% causing visual neglect of the left-hand side of space."
Alcoholic Liver Disease (ALD),"Terry's nails, hepatomegaly, liver disease content","Fatty liver disease (FLD), also known as hepatic steatosis and steatotic liver disease (SLD), is a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver. Often there are no or few symptoms. Occasionally there may be tiredness or pain in the upper right side of the abdomen. Complications may include cirrhosis, liver cancer, and esophageal varices.
The main subtypes of fatty liver disease are metabolic dysfunctionassociated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, formerly ""non-alcoholic fatty liver disease"" (NAFLD)) and alcoholic liver disease (ALD), with the category ""metabolic and alcohol associated liver disease"" (metALD) describing an overlap of the two."
Staphylococcus Infection,"Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, high fever, pustules, pleural effusion, skin and soft tissue infections, proptosis, ascites, foci, nausea","A staphylococcal infection or staph infection is an infection caused by members of the Staphylococcus genus of bacteria.
These bacteria commonly inhabit the skin and nose where they are innocuous, but may enter the body through cuts or abrasions which may be nearly invisible.  Once inside the body, the bacteria may spread to a number of body systems and organs, including the heart, where the toxins produced by the bacteria may cause cardiac arrest.  Once the bacterium has been identified as the cause of the illness, treatment is often in the form of antibiotics and, where possible, drainage of the infected area.  However, many strains of this bacterium have become antibiotic resistant; for those with these kinds of infection, the body's own immune system is the only defense against the disease."
Vesicointestinal Fistula,"Fecal leakage, urinary tract flatulence, abdominal muscle tension","A vesicointestinal fistula (or intestinovesical fistula) is a form of fistula between the bladder and the bowel.


== Types ==
A fistula involving the bladder can have one of many specific names, describing the specific location of its outlet:

Bladder and intestine: ""vesicoenteric"", ""enterovesical"", or ""vesicointestinal""
Bladder and colon: ""vesicocolic"" or ""colovesical""
Bladder and rectum: ""vesicorectal"" or ""rectovesical""


== Symptoms and signs ==
If fecal matter passes through the fistula into the bladder, the existence of the fistula may be revealed by pneumaturia, fecaluria, or recurrent urinary tract infection. Migration of urine through the fistula into the bowel may cause rectal passage of urine.


== Causes ==
Many causes exist including:

diverticulitis : most common ~ 60%
colorectal cancer (CRC) : ~ 20%
Crohn's disease : ~ 10%
radiotherapy
appendicitis
trauma


== Diagnosis ==
Various modalities of diagnosis are available:

Cystoscopy
Colonoscopy
Poppy seed test
Transabdominal ultrasonography
Abdominopelvic CT
MRI
Barium enema
Bourne test
Cystogram
A definite algorithm of tests is followed for making the diagnosis."
Pediatric Guillain-Barr Syndrome,"Distal numbness, pain or abnormal sensations in the limbs, proximal muscle and respiratory paralysis, sensory disturbances, and loss of tendon reflexes.","GuillainBarr syndrome (GBS) is a rapid-onset muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. Typically, both sides of the body are involved, and the initial symptoms are changes in sensation or pain often in the back along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands, often spreading to the arms and upper body. The symptoms may develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening, with about 15% of people developing respiratory muscle weakness requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in the function of the autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure."
Uterine Cancer,"Irregular vaginal bleeding, increased discharge, lower abdominal pain, back pain","Uterine cancer, also known as womb cancer, includes two types of cancer that develop from the tissues of the uterus. Endometrial cancer forms from the lining of the uterus, and uterine sarcoma forms from the muscles or support tissue of the uterus. Endometrial cancer accounts for approximately 90% of all uterine cancers in the United States. Symptoms of endometrial cancer include changes in vaginal bleeding or pain in the pelvis. Symptoms of uterine sarcoma include unusual vaginal bleeding or a mass in the vagina."
Chronic Renal Failure,"Loss of appetite, vomiting, weakness, deep and long breathing","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a type of long-term kidney disease, defined by the sustained presence of abnormal kidney function and/or abnormal kidney structure. To meet criteria for CKD, the abnormalities must be present for at least three months. Early in the course of CKD, patients are usually asymptomatic, but later symptoms may include leg swelling, feeling tired, vomiting, loss of appetite, and confusion. Complications can relate to hormonal dysfunction of the kidneys and include (in chronological order) high blood pressure (often related to activation of the reninangiotensin system), bone disease, and anemia. Additionally CKD patients have markedly increased cardiovascular complications with increased risks of death and hospitalization."
Stranguria,"Distension pain, lower abdominal distension pain, frequent urination accompanied by urgency and pain, low fever, low back pain, fatigue","Strangury (or stranguria) is the symptom characterized by painful, frequent urination of small volumes that are expelled slowly only by straining and despite a severe sense of urgency, usually with the residual feeling of incomplete emptying. The origin of the term is late 14th-century Middle English from Latin strangria, from Greek, from stranx, 'a drop squeezed out' and ouron 'urine.' These 'drops' of urine are 'squeezed out' in what patients describe as painful 'wrenching' spasms. The pain is felt to arise in the suprapubic region and extends up to the root of the genitalia and, in male patients, to the tip of the penis.
This distressing desire to fully void despite its impossibility is attributed to the irritation of urothelium (epithelium lining the urinary tract), especially of the trigone, and subsequent spasm of muscles. It is seen in numerous urological conditions including kidney stones (especially when a stone is impacted at the vesicourethral junction), bladder stones, bladder inflammation (cystitis), and bladder cancer."
Pediatric Anterior Spinal Artery Syndrome,"Neural root irritation, paralysis, paraplegia, urinary retention, sensory disturbances, abnormal sweating, and defecation disorders","Spinal cord stroke is a rare type of stroke with compromised blood flow to any region of spinal cord owing to occlusion or bleeding, leading to irreversible neuronal death. It can be classified into two types, ischaemia and haemorrhage, in which the former accounts for 86% of all cases, a pattern similar to cerebral stroke. The disease is either arisen spontaneously from aortic illnesses or postoperatively. It deprives patients of motor function or sensory function, and sometimes both. Infarction usually occurs in regions perfused by anterior spinal artery, which spans the anterior two-thirds of spinal cord."
Hemorrhagic Septicemia Pasteurella Infection,"Rapid expansion of redness and swelling around the wound, rupture, grey-yellow bloody pus, significant tenderness, osteomyelitis","Haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) is one of the most economically important pasteurelloses. Haemorrhagic septicaemia in cattle and buffaloes was previously known to be associated with one of two serotypes of P. multocida: Asian B:2 and African E:2 according to the Carter-Heddleston system, or 6:B and 6:E using the Namioka-Carter system.
The disease occurs mainly in cattle and buffaloes, but has also been reported in goats (Capra aegagrus hircus), African buffalo (Syncerus nanus), camels, horses and donkeys (Equus africanus asinus), in pigs infected by serogroup B, and in wild elephants (Elephas maximus). Serotypes B:1 and B:3,4 have caused septicaemic disease in antelope (Antilocapra americana) and elk (Cervus canadensis), respectively. Serotype B:4 was associated with the disease in bison (Bison bison)."
Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome,"Vomiting, loss of appetite, weight loss, bloating, colic, malnutrition, anemia, abdominal pain","Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome is a gastro-vascular disorder in which the third and final portion of the duodenum is compressed between the abdominal aorta (AA) and the overlying superior mesenteric artery.  This rare, potentially life-threatening syndrome is typically caused by an angle of 625 between the AA and the SMA, in comparison to the normal range of 3856, due to a lack of retroperitoneal and visceral fat (mesenteric fat). In addition, the aortomesenteric distance is 28 millimeters, as opposed to the typical 1020. However, a narrow SMA angle alone is not enough to make a diagnosis, because patients with a low BMI, most notably children, have been known to have a narrow SMA angle with no symptoms of SMA syndrome.
SMA syndrome is also known as Wilkie's syndrome, cast syndrome, mesenteric root syndrome, chronic duodenal ileus and intermittent arterio-mesenteric occlusion."
Nasal Polyps,"Headache, polyps, frog-like nose, sensation of unblowable nasal mucus, nasal congestion","Nasal polyps are noncancerous growths within the nose or sinuses. Symptoms include trouble breathing through the nose, loss of smell, decreased taste, post nasal drip, and a runny nose. The growths are sac-like, movable, and nontender, though face pain may occasionally occur. They typically occur in both nostrils in those who are affected. Complications may include sinusitis and broadening of the nose."
Adolescent and Pediatric Vaginal Clear Cell Carcinoma,"acute abdomen, nodules, polyps, enuresis, abnormal bleeding, irregular vaginal bleeding, vaginal bleeding, purulent bloody discharge","Ovarian cancer is a cancerous tumor of an ovary. It may originate from the ovary itself or more commonly from communicating nearby structures such as fallopian tubes or the inner lining of the abdomen. The ovary is made up of three different cell types including epithelial cells, germ cells, and stromal cells. When these cells become abnormal, they have the ability to divide and form tumors. These cells can also invade or spread to other parts of the body."
Band Keratopathy,"Corneal opacity, visual impairment, photophobia, and tearing","Band keratopathy is a corneal disease derived from the appearance of calcium on the central cornea. This is an example of metastatic calcification, which by definition, occurs in the presence of hypercalcemia.


== Signs and symptoms ==

Signs and symptoms of band keratopathy include eye pain and decreased visual acuity.


== Causes ==
Band keratopathy has several causes. These causes include uveitis, interstitial keratitis, superficial keratitis, phthisis, sarcoidosis, trauma, intraocular silicone oil, systemic diseases (high levels of calcium in the blood, vitamin D intoxication, Fanconi's Syndrome, low levels of phosphorus in the blood, gout, milk-alkali syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, and chronic mercury exposure)."
Wound Botulism,"Diplopia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, high fever, difficulty breathing, paralysis, ptosis, and photophobia","Botulism is a rare and potentially fatal illness caused by botulinum toxin, which is produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The disease begins with weakness, blurred vision, feeling tired, and trouble speaking. This may then be followed by weakness of the arms, chest muscles, and legs. Vomiting, swelling of the abdomen, and diarrhea may also occur. The disease does not usually affect consciousness or cause a fever."
Acute Tracheobronchitis,"Nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, cough with expectoration, frothy sputum, and difficulty breathing","Bordetella bronchiseptica is a small, gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium of the genus Bordetella. It can cause infectious bronchitis in dogs and other animals, but rarely infects humans. Closely related to B. pertussisthe obligate human pathogen that causes pertussis (whooping cough); B. bronchiseptica can persist in the environment for extended periods.


== Pathogenesis ==
Humans are not natural carriers of B. bronchiseptica, which typically infects the respiratory tracts of smaller mammals (cats, dogs, rabbits, etc.). People are more likely to be infected by B. pertussis or B. parapertussis."
Small Intestinal Fibroma,"Emaciation, abdominal pain, bloody stool, abdominal mass, bloating, fresh red blood in stool","Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, abdominal distension, and weight loss. Complications outside of the gastrointestinal tract may include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and fatigue. The skin rashes may be due to infections, as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction may occur as a complication of chronic inflammation, and those with the disease are at greater risk of colon cancer and small bowel cancer."
Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus,"Grouped vesicles not exceeding the midline of the face, photophobia, tearing, vesicles of various sizes arranged in a band-like pattern appearing prior to the rash.","Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO), also known as ophthalmic zoster, is shingles involving the eye or the surrounding area. Common signs include a rash of the forehead with swelling of the eyelid. There may also be eye pain and redness, inflammation of the conjunctiva, cornea or uvea, and sensitivity to light. Fever and tingling of the skin and allodynia near the eye may precede the rash. Complications may include visual impairment, increased pressure within the eye, chronic pain, and stroke."
Pilar Cyst,"Cystic nodules on the scalp, mostly solitary, more common in females","A trichilemmal cyst (or pilar cyst) is a common cyst that forms from a hair follicle, most often on the scalp, and is smooth, mobile, and filled with keratin, a protein component found in hair, nails, skin, and horns. Trichilemmal cysts are clinically and histologically distinct from trichilemmal horns, hard tissue that is much rarer and not limited to the scalp. Rarely, these cysts may grow more extensively and form rapidly multiplying trichilemmal tumors, also called proliferating trichilemmal cysts, which are benign, but may grow aggressively at the cyst site. Very rarely, trichilemmal cysts can become cancerous.


== Classification ==
Trichilemmal cysts may be classified as sebaceous cysts, although technically speaking are not sebaceous."
Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA),"Muscular atrophy of spinal origin, difficulty in swallowing, muscular weakness, abnormal tendon reflex, poor sucking, disappearance of tendon reflex, atrophy of the tongue muscles, muscle atrophy","Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare neuromuscular disorder that results in the loss of motor neurons and progressive muscle wasting. It is usually diagnosed in infancy or early childhood and if left untreated it is the most common genetic cause of infant death. It may also appear later in life and then have a milder course of the disease. The common feature is the progressive weakness of voluntary muscles, with the arm, leg, and respiratory muscles being affected first. Associated problems may include poor head control, difficulties swallowing, scoliosis, and joint contractures."
Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis,"Coma, headache, edema, nausea and vomiting, visual impairment, systemic infection and toxemia, exophthalmos, mastoid edema behind the ear, retinal vein tortuosity and anger expansion, retinal edema, retinal hemorrhage, optic disc edema","Cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is the formation of a blood clot within the cavernous sinus, a cavity at the base of the brain which drains deoxygenated blood from the brain back to the heart. This is a rare disorder and can be of two typesseptic cavernous thrombosis and aseptic cavernous thrombosis. The most common form is septic cavernous sinus thrombosis. The cause is usually from a spreading infection in the nose, sinuses, ears, or teeth. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus are often the associated bacteria."
Ovarian Sclerosing Stromal Tumor,"Menstrual irregularities due to hormonal disturbances, primary or secondary infertility, postmenopausal bleeding, virilization","Ovarian tumors, or ovarian neoplasms, are tumors in the ovary. Not all are ovarian cancer. They consist of mainly solid tissue, while ovarian cysts contain fluid.
In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) divided ovarian tumours as 90% epithelial, 3% germ cell, and 2% sex cord-stromal types.


== Histopathologic classification ==

Tumor of the ovary vary remarkably as they may arise from any of the 3 cell types of the normal ovary."
Benign Tumor of the Pharynx,"Difficulty breathing, foreign body sensation in the throat, difficulty swallowing","Otorhinolaryngology ( oh-toh-RY-noh-LARR-in-GOL--jee, abbreviated ORL and also known as otolaryngology, otolaryngology  head and neck surgery (ORLH&N or OHNS), or ear, nose, and throat (ENT)) is a surgical subspecialty within medicine that deals with the surgical and medical management of conditions of the head and neck. Doctors who specialize in this area are called otorhinolaryngologists, otolaryngologists, head and neck surgeons, or ENT surgeons or physicians.
Patients seek treatment from an otorhinolaryngologist for diseases of the ear, nose, throat, base of the skull, head, and neck. These commonly include functional diseases that affect the senses and activities of eating, drinking, speaking, breathing, swallowing, and hearing. In addition, ENT surgery encompasses the surgical management of cancers and benign tumors and reconstruction of the head and neck as well as plastic surgery of the face, scalp, and neck."
Blood Syndrome,"Acute anemia, severe anemia, iron deficiency anemia, chronic anemia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, hemolytic anemia, physiological anemia in children, astringent pulse, absence of lunula in fingernails, deficiency in both qi and blood, facial pain, deficiency in essence and blood","Bloom syndrome (often abbreviated as BS in literature) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by short stature, predisposition to the development of cancer, and genomic instability. BS is caused by mutations in the BLM gene which is a member of the RecQ DNA helicase family. Mutations in genes encoding other members of this family, namely WRN and RECQL4, are associated with the clinical entities Werner syndrome and RothmundThomson syndrome, respectively. More broadly, Bloom syndrome is a member of a class of clinical entities that are characterized by chromosomal instability, genomic instability, or both, and cancer predisposition.
Cells from a person with Bloom syndrome exhibit a striking genomic instability that includes excessive crossovers between homologous chromosomes and sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs)."
Primary Myelofibrosis,"Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, ascites, portal hypertension, fatigue, weight loss, anemia, bone pain","Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a rare bone marrow blood cancer. It is classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm, a group of cancers in which there is activation and growth of mutated cells in the bone marrow. This is most often associated with a somatic mutation in the JAK2, CALR, or MPL genes. In PMF, the bony aspects of bone marrow are remodeled in a process called osteosclerosis; in addition, fibroblasts secrete collagen and reticulin proteins that are collectively referred to as fibrosis. These two pathological processes compromise the normal function of bone marrow, resulting in decreased production of blood cells such as erythrocytes (red cells), granulocytes, and megakaryocytes."
Wegener's Granulomatosis,"Fever, weight loss, fatigue, joint pain, myalgia, purpura, hemorrhagic vesicles, nodules, cough, and hemoptysis","Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), after Nazi German physician Friedrich Wegener, is a rare, long-term, systemic disorder that involves the formation of granulomas and inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis). It is an autoimmune disease and a form of vasculitis that affects small- and medium-sized vessels in many organs, but most commonly affects the upper respiratory tract, lungs, and kidneys. The signs and symptoms of GPA are highly varied and reflect which organs are supplied by the affected blood vessels. Typical signs and symptoms include nosebleeds, stuffy nose and crustiness of nasal secretions, and inflammation of the uveal layer of the eye.  Damage to the heart, lungs, and kidneys can be fatal."
Cardiac Metastatic Malignant Melanoma,"Dyspnea, Tachycardia, Cardiogenic Edema, Congestive Heart Failure, Angina, Arrhythmias, Pericardial Effusion","Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium). The area most commonly affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding each testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly."
Pregnancy Complicated by Viral Hepatitis,"Nausea, vomiting, fatigue, jaundice, aversion to greasy food, dull pain in the upper right abdomen, bloating","Caesarean section, also known as C-section, cesarean, or caesarean delivery, is the surgical procedure by which one or more babies are delivered through an incision in the mother's abdomen. It is often performed because vaginal delivery would put the mother or child at risk (of paralysis or even death). Reasons for the operation include, but are not limited to, obstructed labor, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, shoulder presentation, and problems with the placenta or umbilical cord. A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section. A trial of vaginal birth after C-section may be possible."
Osteofibrosarcoma,"Joint swelling, pain, loss of mobility, persistent pain without injury, swelling, night pain, weight-bearing pain, relief after rest","The International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) is a domain-specific extension of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems for tumor diseases. This classification is widely used by cancer registries.
It is currently in its third revision (ICD-O-3). ICD-10 includes a list of morphology codes. They stem from ICD-O second edition (ICD-O-2) that was valid at the time of publication."
Vaginal Prolapse,"Protrusion of the vagina, feeling of friction, discharge, bleeding, sensation of heaviness, lumbosacral pain, and difficulty urinating","Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is characterized by descent of pelvic organs from their normal positions into the vagina. In women, the condition usually occurs when the pelvic floor collapses after gynecological cancer treatment, childbirth or heavy lifting. Injury incurred to fascia membranes and other connective structures can result in cystocele, rectocele or both. Treatment can involve dietary and lifestyle changes, physical therapy, or surgery.


== Types ==

Anterior vaginal wall prolapse
Cystocele (bladder into vagina)
Urethrocele (urethra into vagina)
Cystourethrocele (both bladder and urethra)
Posterior vaginal wall prolapse
Enterocele (small intestine into vagina)
Rectocele (rectum into vagina)
Sigmoidocele
Apical vaginal prolapse
Uterine prolapse (uterus into vagina)
Vaginal vault prolapse (descent of the roof of vagina)  after surgical removal of the uterus hysterectomy


== Grading ==
Pelvic organ prolapses are graded either via the BadenWalker System, Shaw's System, or the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) System."
Pediatric Acute Cholecystitis,"Abdominal pain, jaundice, nausea, vomiting","Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. Symptoms commonly include right lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever and decreased appetite. However, approximately 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms. Severe complications of a ruptured appendix include widespread, painful inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall and sepsis.
Appendicitis is primarily caused by a blockage of the hollow portion in the appendix."
Hemorrhagic Cystitis,"Hematuria, urinary urgency, urinary pain, anemia","Hemorrhagic cystitis or haemorrhagic cystitis is an inflammation of the bladder defined by lower urinary tract symptoms that include dysuria, hematuria, and hemorrhage. The disease can occur as a complication of cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide and radiation therapy. In addition to hemorrhagic cystitis, temporary hematuria can also be seen in bladder infection or in children as a result of viral infection.


== Signs and symptoms ==
The symptoms of hemorrhagic cystitis include pain or burning feeling while urinating, frequent need to urinate, loss of control of the bladder, blood or blood clots in the urine, inability to urinate, and fever.


== Causes ==
Causes of hemorrhagic cystitis include chemotherapy (e.g."
Zygomycosis,"Visual impairments, meningitis, encephalitis-like changes, cranial nerve damage, facial pain, paralysis","Zygomycosis is the broadest term to refer to infections caused by bread mold fungi of the zygomycota phylum. However, because zygomycota has been identified as polyphyletic, and is not included in modern fungal classification systems, the diseases that zygomycosis can refer to are better called by their specific names: mucormycosis (after Mucorales), phycomycosis (after Phycomycetes) and basidiobolomycosis (after Basidiobolus). These rare yet serious and potentially life-threatening fungal infections usually affect the face or oropharyngeal (nose and mouth) cavity. Zygomycosis type infections are most often caused by common fungi found in soil and decaying vegetation. While most individuals are exposed to the fungi on a regular basis, those with immune disorders (immunocompromised) are more prone to fungal infection."
Renal Failure,"Nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, restlessness, somnolence, oliguria, anuria, coma","Kidney failure, also known as renal failure or end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is a medical condition in which the kidneys can no longer adequately filter waste products from the blood, functioning at less than 15% of normal levels. Kidney failure is classified as either acute kidney failure, which develops rapidly and may resolve; and chronic kidney failure, which develops slowly and can often be irreversible. Symptoms may include leg swelling, feeling tired, vomiting, loss of appetite, and confusion. Complications of acute and chronic failure include uremia, hyperkalemia, and volume overload. Complications of chronic failure also include heart disease, high blood pressure, and anaemia."
Intussusception,"Abdominal pain, vomiting, bloody stool, abdominal mass, loss of appetite, fever","A rectal prolapse occurs when walls of the rectum have prolapsed to such a degree that they protrude out of the anus and are visible outside the body. However, most researchers agree that there are 3 to 5 different types of rectal prolapse, depending on whether the prolapsed section is visible externally, and whether the full or only partial thickness of the rectal wall is involved.
Rectal prolapse may occur without any symptoms, but depending upon the nature of the prolapse there may be mucous discharge (mucus coming from the anus), rectal bleeding, degrees of fecal incontinence, and obstructed defecation symptoms.
Rectal prolapse is generally more common in elderly women, although it may occur at any age and in either sex. It is very rarely life-threatening, but the symptoms can be debilitating if left untreated."
Primary Angle-Closure Glaucoma,"Mild eye pain, decreased vision, rainbow vision, migraine, nausea","Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can lead to damage of the optic nerve. The optic nerve transmits visual information from the eye to the brain. Glaucoma may cause vision loss if left untreated. It has been called the ""silent thief of sight"" because the loss of vision usually occurs slowly over a long period of time. A major risk factor for glaucoma is increased pressure within the eye, known as intraocular pressure (IOP)."
Pediatric Care,"Fever, abdominal pain, vomiting milk","A pediatric intensive care unit (also paediatric), usually abbreviated to PICU (), is an area within a hospital specializing in the care of critically ill infants, children, teenagers, and young adults aged 021. A PICU is typically directed by one or more pediatric intensivists or PICU consultants and staffed by doctors, nurses, and respiratory therapists who are specially trained and experienced in pediatric intensive care.  The unit may also have nurse practitioners, physician assistants, physiotherapists, social workers, child life specialists, and clerks on staff, although this varies widely depending on geographic location.  The ratio of professionals to patients is generally higher than in other areas of the hospital, reflecting the acuity of PICU patients and the risk of life-threatening complications.  Complex technology and equipment is often in use, particularly mechanical ventilators and patient monitoring systems."
Bone Injury,"Pain, swelling, difficulty walking","A bone fracture (abbreviated FRX or Fx, Fx, or #) is a medical condition in which there is a partial or complete break in the continuity of any bone in the body. In more severe cases, the bone may be broken into several fragments, known as a comminuted fracture. An open fracture (or compound fracture) is a bone fracture where the broken bone breaks through the skin. 
A bone fracture may be the result of high force impact or stress, or a minimal trauma injury as a result of certain medical conditions that weaken the bones, such as osteoporosis, osteopenia, bone cancer, or osteogenesis imperfecta, where the fracture is then properly termed a pathologic fracture. Most bone fractures require urgent medical attention to prevent further injury."
Anal Canal Cancer,"Increased frequency of defecation, often accompanied by mucous or purulent blood, sense of incomplete evacuation or urgent defecation, anal pain,","Anal cancer is a cancer which arises from the anus, the distal opening of the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms may include bleeding from the anus or a lump near the anus. Other symptoms may include pain, itchiness, or discharge from the anus. A change in bowel movements may also occur.
Risk factors include human papillomavirus (HPV), HIV/AIDS, receptive anal sex, smoking, and many sexual partners."
Pilomatricoma,"Single, isolated nodule","Pilomatricoma is a benign skin tumor derived from the hair matrix. These neoplasms are relatively uncommon and typically occur on the scalp, face, and upper extremities. Clinically, pilomatricomas present as a subcutaneous nodule or cyst with unremarkable overlying epidermis that can range in size from 0.5 to 3.0 cm, but the largest reported case was 24 cm.


== Presentation ==


=== Associations ===
Pilomatricomas have been observed in a variety of genetic disorders including Turner syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, RubinsteinTaybi syndrome, trisomy 9, and Gardner syndrome. It has been reported that the prevalence of pilomatricomas in Turner syndrome is 2.6%."
Spinal Hemorrhagic Disease,"Back pain, paraplegia, sphincter dysfunction, neck and back pain, signs of meningeal irritation","Spinal cord stroke is a rare type of stroke with compromised blood flow to any region of spinal cord owing to occlusion or bleeding, leading to irreversible neuronal death. It can be classified into two types, ischaemia and haemorrhage, in which the former accounts for 86% of all cases, a pattern similar to cerebral stroke. The disease is either arisen spontaneously from aortic illnesses or postoperatively. It deprives patients of motor function or sensory function, and sometimes both. Infarction usually occurs in regions perfused by anterior spinal artery, which spans the anterior two-thirds of spinal cord."
Chronic Pancreatitis,"Abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloating, nausea and vomiting, weight loss, weakness, malnutrition, decreased appetite, fatigue, steatorrhea","Chronic pancreatitis is a long-standing inflammation of the pancreas that alters the organ's normal structure and functions. It can present as episodes of acute inflammation in a previously injured pancreas, or as chronic damage with persistent pain or malabsorption. It is a disease process characterized by irreversible damage to the pancreas as distinct from reversible changes in acute pancreatitis. Tobacco smoke and alcohol misuse are two of the most frequently implicated causes, and the two risk factors are thought to have a synergistic effect with regards to the development of chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is a risk factor for the development of pancreatic cancer."
Infantile Amaurotic Idiocy,"Dementia, convulsions, ataxia, loss of light reflex, decreased muscle tone, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, seizures","TaySachs disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disease that results in the destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The most common form is infantile TaySachs disease, which becomes apparent around the age of three to six months of age, with the infant losing the ability to turn over, sit, or crawl. This is then followed by seizures, hearing loss, and inability to move, with death usually occurring by the age of three to five. Less commonly, the disease may occur later in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood (juvenile or late-onset). These forms tend to be less severe, but the juvenile form typically results in death by the age of 15."
Stillbirth,"Absence of fetal heart tones (no fetal heartbeat), decreased fetal movement, fatigue, loss of appetite","Stillbirth is typically defined as fetal death at or after 20 or 28 weeks of pregnancy, depending on the source.:Overview tab, It results in a baby born without signs of life. A stillbirth can often result in the feeling of guilt or grief in the mother. The term is in contrast to miscarriage, which is an early pregnancy loss, and sudden infant death syndrome, where the baby dies a short time after being born alive.
Often the cause is unknown. Causes may include pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia and birth complications, problems with the placenta or umbilical cord, birth defects, infections such as malaria and syphilis, and poor health in the mother.:Causes tab, Risk factors include a mother's age over 35, smoking, drug use, use of assisted reproductive technology, and first pregnancy."
Lung Cancer,"Irritative cough, blood in sputum","Lung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma, is a malignant tumor that begins in the lung. Lung cancer is caused by genetic damage to the DNA of cells in the airways, often caused by cigarette smoking or inhaling damaging chemicals. Damaged airway cells gain the ability to multiply unchecked, causing the growth of a tumor. Without treatment, tumors spread throughout the lung, damaging lung function. Eventually lung tumors metastasize, spreading to other parts of the body."
Cardiac Asthma,"Awakening at night due to shortness of breath, compelled to sit up to breathe, frequent coughing, dyspnea, cyanosis, profuse sweating, cold extremities, coughing up pink frothy sputum, palpitations, chest tightness","Cardiac asthma is the medical condition of intermittent wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath that is associated with underlying congestive heart failure (CHF). Symptoms of cardiac asthma are related to the heart's inability to effectively and efficiently pump blood in a CHF patient. This can lead to accumulation of fluid in and around the lungs (pulmonary congestion), disrupting the lung's ability to oxygenate blood.
Cardiac asthma carries similar symptoms to bronchial asthma, but is differentiated by lacking inflammatory origin. Because of the similarity in symptoms, diagnosis of cardiac versus bronchial asthma relies on full cardiac workup and pulmonary function testing."
Keratosis Pilaris,"Papules, itching, severe pain","Keratosis pilaris  (KP; also follicular keratosis, lichen pilaris, or colloquially chicken skin.) is a common, autosomal-dominant, genetic condition of the skin's hair follicles characterized by the appearance of possibly itchy, small, gooseflesh-like bumps, with varying degrees of reddening or inflammation. It most often appears on the outer sides of the upper arms (the forearms can also be affected), thighs, face, back, and buttocks; KP can also occur on the hands, and tops of legs, sides, or any body part except glabrous (hairless) skin (like the palms or soles of feet). Often the lesions can appear on the face, which may be mistaken for acne or folliculitis.
The several types of KP have been associated with pregnancy, type 1 diabetes mellitus, obesity, dry skin, allergic diseases (e.g., atopic dermatitis), and rarely cancer. Many rarer types of the disorder are part of inherited genetic syndromes."
Soft Tissue Sarcoma,"Pain, lymph node enlargement, dull ache","A soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) is a malignant tumor, a type of cancer, that develops in soft tissue. A soft-tissue sarcoma is often a painless mass that grows slowly over months or years. They may be superficial or deep-seated. Any such unexplained mass must be diagnosed by biopsy. Treatment may include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted drug therapy."
Pediatric Liver Failure,"Hepatic encephalopathy, raised intracranial pressure, bleeding","Metabolic dysfunctionassociated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a type of chronic liver disease. 
This condition is diagnosed when there is excessive fat build-up in the liver (hepatic steatosis), and at least one metabolic risk factor. When there is also increased alcohol intake, the term MetALD, or metabolic dysfunction and alcohol associated/related liver disease is used, and differentiated from alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) where alcohol is the predominant cause of the steatotic liver disease.  The terms non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, now MASH) have been used to describe different severities, the latter indicating the presence of further liver inflammation. NAFL is less dangerous than NASH and usually does not progress to it, but this progression may eventually lead to complications, such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, liver failure, and cardiovascular disease."
Periosteal Chondroma,A round or ovoid mass of varying sizes on the outer surface of the cortical bone.,"Chondrosarcoma is a bone sarcoma, a primary cancer composed of cells derived from transformed cells that produce cartilage. A chondrosarcoma is a member of a category of tumors of bone and soft tissue known as sarcomas.  About 30% of bone sarcomas are chondrosarcomas. It is resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Unlike other primary bone sarcomas that mainly affect children and adolescents, a chondrosarcoma can present at any age."
Heatstroke,"Hyperthermia, hypertension, respiratory failure, mental disorders, heat exhaustion, abnormal sweating, reduced or absent tear, saliva, and sweat secretion, persistent fever, general debilitation, heat cramps","Heat stroke or heatstroke, also known as sun-stroke, is a severe heat illness that results in a body temperature greater than 40.0 C (104.0 F), along with red skin, headache, dizziness, and confusion. Sweating is generally present in exertional heatstroke, but not in classic heatstroke. The start of heat stroke can be sudden or gradual. Heatstroke is a life-threatening condition due to the potential for multi-organ dysfunction, with typical complications including seizures, rhabdomyolysis, or kidney failure.
Heat stroke occurs because of high external temperatures and/or physical exertion."
Eyelid Basal Cell Carcinoma,"Refractory ulcers, erythema squamosum, crusts, nodules, plaques, scleroderma, milia-like cysts, disturbance in eye movement","Basal-cell carcinoma (BCC), also known as basal-cell cancer, basalioma or rodent ulcer, is the most common type of skin cancer. It often appears as a painless raised area of skin, which may be shiny with small blood vessels running over it. It may also present as a raised area with ulceration. Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it, but it is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death.
Risk factors include exposure to ultraviolet light, having lighter skin, radiation therapy, long-term exposure to arsenic and poor immune-system function."
Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma,"Nodules, Papules, Thermalgia","Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is a rare tumor, first characterized by Sharon Weiss and Franz Enzinger in 1982 that both clinically and histologically is intermediate between angiosarcoma and hemangioma. However, a distinct, disease-defining genetic alteration recently described for EHE indicates that it is an entirely separate entity from both angiosarcoma and hemangioma.
EHE is a soft tissue sarcoma and is generally considered a vascular cancer insofar as the lesional cells have surface markers typical of endothelial cells (cells lining the interior of blood vessels). EHE was originally described as occurring most commonly in the veins of the extremities (arms and legs) and two organs, the liver and lungs. It has since been described in organs throughout the body."
Aortic Stenosis,"Chest tightness, palpitations, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing","Aortic stenosis (AS or AoS) is the narrowing  of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aorta begins), such that problems result. It may occur at the aortic valve as well as above and below this level. It typically gets worse over time. Symptoms often come on gradually with a decreased ability to exercise often occurring first. If heart failure, loss of consciousness, or heart related chest pain occur due to AS the outcomes are worse."
Foreign Body in the Respiratory Tract,"Wheezing, rales, asphyxiation","Foreign body aspiration occurs when a foreign body enters the airway which can cause difficulty breathing or choking. Objects may reach the respiratory tract and the digestive tract from the mouth and nose, but when an object enters the respiratory tract it is termed aspiration. The foreign body can then become lodged in the trachea or further down the respiratory tract such as in a bronchus. Regardless of the type of object, any aspiration can be a life-threatening situation and requires timely recognition and action to minimize risk of complications. While advances have been made in management of this condition leading to significantly improved clinical outcomes, there were still 2,700 deaths resulting from foreign body aspiration in 2018."
Pulp Necrosis,"Toothache, loose teeth, bleeding gums","Pulp necrosis is a clinical diagnostic category indicating the death of cells and tissues in the pulp chamber of a tooth with or without bacterial invasion. It is often the result of many cases of dental trauma, caries and irreversible pulpitis.
In the initial stage of the infection, the pulp chamber is partially necrosed for a period of time and if left untreated, the area of cell death expands until the entire pulp necroses. The most common clinical signs present in a tooth with a necrosed pulp would be a grey discoloration of the crown and/or periapical radiolucency. This altered translucency in the tooth is due to disruption and cutting off of the apical neurovascular blood supply."
Acute Heart Failure,"Syncope, apnea, cyanosis, angina, shock, coma, palpitations, heart failure, reduced cardiac output, cerebral ischemia, loss of consciousness, orthopnea","Heart failure (HF), also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), is a syndrome caused by an impairment in the heart's ability to fill with and pump blood.
Although symptoms vary based on which side of the heart is affected, HF typically presents with shortness of breath, excessive fatigue, and bilateral leg swelling. The severity of the heart failure is mainly decided based on ejection fraction and also measured by the severity of symptoms. Other conditions that have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver disease, anemia, and thyroid disease.
Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excessive alcohol consumption, infection, and cardiomyopathy."
Spontaneous Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,"Shock, syncope, emotional apathy, delirium, catatonia, self-orientation disorder, nausea and vomiting, dementia, epilepsy and epileptiform seizures, general discomfort","Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is bleeding into the subarachnoid spacethe area between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain. Symptoms may include a severe headache of rapid onset, vomiting, decreased level of consciousness, fever, weakness, numbness, and sometimes seizures. Neck stiffness or neck pain are also relatively common. In about a quarter of people a small bleed with resolving symptoms occurs within a month of a larger bleed.
SAH may occur as a result of a head injury or spontaneously, usually from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm."
Urinary Tract Tumor,"Nodules, inflammatory cell infiltration, papules","Bladder cancer is the abnormal growth of cells in the bladder. These cells can grow to form a tumor, which eventually spreads, damaging the bladder and other organs. Most people with bladder cancer are diagnosed after noticing blood in their urine. Those suspected of having bladder cancer typically have their bladder inspected by a thin medical camera, a procedure called cystoscopy. Suspected tumors are removed and examined to determine if they are cancerous."
Ewing's Sarcoma in children,"Anemia, neuralgia, pleural effusion, accelerated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, tumor compression, defecation disorders","Ewing sarcoma is a type of pediatric cancer that forms in bone or soft tissue. Symptoms may include swelling and pain at the site of the tumor, fever, and a bone fracture. The most common areas where it begins are the legs, pelvis, and chest wall. In about 25% of cases, the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis. Complications may include a pleural effusion or paraplegia."
Pediatric Leukemia,"Anemia, recurrent high fever, persistent fever, fever, bleeding spots on mucous membranes, sternal tenderness, generalized weakness","Childhood leukemia is leukemia that occurs in a child and is a type of childhood cancer. Childhood leukemia is the most common childhood cancer, accounting for 29% of cancers in children aged 014 in 2018. There are multiple forms of leukemia that occur in children, the most common being acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) followed by acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Survival rates vary depending on the type of leukemia, but may be as high as 90% in ALL.
Leukemia is a hematological malignancy or a cancer of the blood. It develops in the bone marrow, the soft inner part of bones where new blood cells are made."
Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding,"Acute abdominal pain, ascites, gastrointestinal bleeding","Gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed), also called gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIB), is all forms of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the rectum. When there is significant blood loss over a short time, symptoms may include vomiting red blood, vomiting black blood, bloody stool, or black stool. Small amounts of bleeding over a long time may cause iron-deficiency anemia resulting in feeling tired or heart-related chest pain. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, shortness of breath, pale skin, or passing out. Sometimes in those with small amounts of bleeding no symptoms may be present."
Wilms' Tumor,"Fever, abdominal pain, abdominal swelling, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, abdominal mass, hypertension, hematuria","Wilms' tumor or Wilms tumor, also known as nephroblastoma, is a cancer of the kidneys that typically occurs in children (rarely in adults), and occurs most commonly as a renal tumor in child patients. It is named after Max Wilms, the German surgeon (18671918) who first described it.
Approximately 650 cases are diagnosed in the U.S. annually. The majority of cases occur in children with no associated genetic syndromes; however, a minority of children with Wilms' tumor have a congenital abnormality.  It is highly responsive to treatment, with about 90 percent of children being cured."
Renal Carbuncle,"Redness, swelling, heat, and pain in the kidney area, abdominal distension below the abdomen and ribs, alternating chills and fever","Stanley James Carroll Beck (21 February 1929  6 August 1973) was an English television actor.  He appeared in a number of programmes, but is best known for the role of Private Walker, a cockney spiv, in the BBC sitcom Dad's Army from the show's beginning in 1968 until his sudden death in 1973.


== Early life ==
Beck was born on 21 February 1929 in Islington, North London, and attended Popham Road Primary School.
After attending Saint Martin's School of Art and doing his national service as a physical training instructor in the British Army, Beck became an actor.


== Career ==


=== Theatre ===
In 1949, Beck made his career acting debut in Little Lambs Eat Ivy at the Granville Theatre, Ramsgate."
Hepatic Encephalopathy,"Headache, dizziness, memory impairment, consciousness disturbances, somnolence, stupor, increased intracranial pressure, myoclonus, increased speech, hallucinations, coma","Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is an altered level of consciousness as a result of liver failure. Its onset may be gradual or sudden. Other symptoms may include movement problems, changes in mood, or changes in personality. In the advanced stages, it can result in a coma.
Hepatic encephalopathy can occur in those with acute or chronic liver disease."
Orbital Fungal Disease,"Orbital abscess, decreased vision, eyelid ptosis, facial pain","Mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, is a severe fungal infection that comes under fulminant fungal sinusitis, usually in people who are immunocompromised. It is curable only when diagnosed early. Symptoms depend on where in the body the infection occurs. It most commonly infects the nose, sinuses, eyes and brain resulting in a runny nose, one-sided facial swelling and pain, headache, fever, blurred vision, bulging or displacement of the eye (proptosis), and tissue death. Other forms of disease may infect the lungs, stomach and intestines, and skin."
Ocular Trauma,"Eye pain, eyelid abrasions and bruising, eye muscle paralysis, subconjunctival hemorrhage, eye irritation or burns","Blast-related ocular trauma comprises a specialized subgroup blast injuries which cause penetrating and blunt force injuries to the eye and its structure. The incidence of ocular trauma due to blast forces has increased dramatically with the introduction of new explosives technology into modern warfare. The availability of these volatile materials, coupled with the tactics of contemporary terrorism, has caused a rise in the number of homemade bombs capable of extreme physical harm.


== Military classification of improvised explosive devices ==
The United States Department of Defense classifies IEDs as explosive machines that are constructed exclusively (i.e., without mass production) and result in the direct physical harm of surrounding individuals. The use of these bombs by insurgents has been the number one cause of death and injury among Coalition soldiers since the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom in April 2003."
Vitreous Hemorrhage,"Floating dark shadows in front of the eyes, floaters, and decreased vision","Vitreous hemorrhage is the extravasation, or leakage, of blood into the areas in and around the vitreous humor of the eye. The vitreous humor is the clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina of the eye. A variety of conditions can result in blood leaking into the vitreous humor, which can cause impaired vision, floaters, and photopsia.


== Symptoms ==
Common symptoms of vitreous hemorrhage include:

Blurred vision
Floaters  faint cobweb-like apparitions floating through the field of vision
Reddish tint to vision
Photopsia  brief flashes of light in the peripheral vision
Small vitreous hemorrhage often manifests itself as ""floaters."" A moderate case will often result in dark streaks in the vision, while dense vitreous hemorrhage can significantly inhibit vision.


== Causes ==
There are many factors known to cause vitreous hemorrhage."
Superior Vena Cava Syndrome (SVCS),"Edema, difficulty swallowing, chest pain, cough, cyanosis, dyspnea, hoarseness, ascites, jaundice, hepatomegaly","Superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS), is a group of symptoms caused by obstruction of the superior vena cava (""SVC""), a short, wide vessel carrying circulating blood into the heart. The majority of cases are caused by malignant tumors within the mediastinum, most commonly lung cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, directly compressing or invading the SVC wall.  Non-malignant causes are increasing in prevalence due to expanding use of intravascular devices (such as permanent central venous catheters and leads for pacemakers and defibrillators), which can result in thrombosis.  Other non-malignant causes include benign mediastinal tumors, aortic aneurysm, infections, and fibrosing mediastinitis.
Characteristic features are edema (swelling due to excess fluid) of the face and arms and development of swollen collateral veins on the front of the chest wall."
Non-gonococcal Prostatitis,"Urinary urgency, frequent urination, painful urination, incomplete urination, urethral burning, pain in the sacral and lower abdomen, perineum pain, decreased libido, impotence, premature ejaculation, pain during ejaculation","Neisseria gonorrhoeae, also known as gonococcus (singular) or gonococci (plural), is a species of Gram-negative diplococci bacteria first isolated by Albert Neisser in 1879. An  obligate human pathogen, it primarily colonizes the mucosal lining of the urogenital tract; however, it is also capable of adhering to the mucosa of the nose, pharynx, rectum, and conjunctiva. It causes the sexually transmitted genitourinary infection gonorrhea as well as other forms of gonococcal disease including disseminated gonococcemia, septic arthritis, and gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum.
N. gonorrhoeae is oxidase positive and a microaerophile that is capable of surviving phagocytosis and growing inside neutrophils. Culturing it requires carbon dioxide supplementation and enriched agar (chocolate agar) with various antibiotics (ThayerMartin)."
Fibroma,"Inflammation, perianal soft fibroma, papule, weight gain, perianal soft fibroma","Fibromas are benign tumors that are composed of fibrous or connective tissue. They can grow in all organs, arising from mesenchyme  tissue. The term ""fibroblastic"" or ""fibromatous"" is used to describe tumors of the fibrous connective tissue. When the term fibroma is used without modifier, it is usually considered benign, with the term fibrosarcoma reserved for malignant tumors.


== Types ==


=== Hard fibroma ===
The hard fibroma (fibroma durum) consists of many fibres and few cells, e.g."
Oral Leukoplakia,"Inflammatory cell infiltration, pale and swollen tongue, root of the tongue abscess, white patches, erosion, pain","Oral leukoplakia is a potentially malignant disorder affecting the oral mucosa. It is defined as ""essentially an oral mucosal white/gray lesion that cannot be considered as any other definable lesion."" Oral leukoplakia is a gray patch or plaque that develops in the oral cavity and is strongly associated with smoking. Leukoplakia is a firmly attached white patch on a mucous membrane which is associated with increased risk of cancer. The edges of the lesion are typically abrupt and the lesion changes with time. Advanced forms may develop red patches."
Orbital Venous Hemangioma,"Proptosis, limitation of downward gaze, arteriovenous shunting phenomena, vascular malformation, bloody otorrhea, eyelid swelling and pale green color, changes in visual acuity and field, local venous tenderness, birthmark, intraventricular hemorrhage, periorbital edema, extraocular metastasis","Cavernous hemangioma, also called cavernous angioma, venous malformation, or cavernoma, is a type of venous malformation due to endothelial dysmorphogenesis from a lesion which is present at birth. A cavernoma in the brain is called a cerebral cavernous malformation or CCM.  Despite its designation as a hemangioma, a cavernous hemangioma is a benign (but not harmless) condition, not a malignant tumor, as it does not display endothelial hyperplasia. The abnormal tissue causes a slowing of blood flow through the cavities, or ""caverns"". The blood vessels do not form the necessary junctions with surrounding cells, and the structural support from the smooth muscle is hindered, causing leakage into the surrounding tissue. It is the leakage of blood (hemorrhage) that causes a variety of symptoms known to be associated with the condition."
Ovarian Pregnancy,"Amenorrhea, abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, internal bleeding, ectopic pregnancy, cervical motion tenderness, tenderness in the posterior vaginal fornix, positive urine pregnancy test, abdominal tenderness, rebound tenderness in the lower abdomen","Ovarian pregnancy refers to an ectopic pregnancy that is located in the ovary. Typically the egg cell is not released or picked up at ovulation, but fertilized within the ovary where the pregnancy implants. Such a pregnancy usually does not proceed past the first four weeks of pregnancy. An untreated ovarian pregnancy causes potentially fatal intra-abdominal bleeding and thus may become a medical emergency.


== Cause and pathology ==
The cause of ovarian pregnancy is unknown, specifically as the usual causative factors  pelvic inflammatory disease and pelvic surgery  implicated in tubal ectopic pregnancy seem to be uninvolved."
Villonodular Synovitis,"Diffuse joint swelling, tenderness, and the presence of soft, flexible nodules can be palpated","Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) is a non-malignant tumor defined histologically as inclusions of osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells, hemosiderin, and macrophages. This histology can present one of 2 clinically distinct ways. Localized/nodular TGCT (L-TGCT), sometimes referred to as giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath;:100 is a common tumor that presents as a slow-growing, encapsulated, localized and limited bump, most frequently in the fingers.  Diffuse TGCT (D-TGCT)  also called pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a rare tumor that presents as a proliferative, destructive, intra-articular lesion, most commonly in the knee.:102  D-TGCT tumors often develop from the lining of joints (also known as synovial tissue).:100:245. Common symptoms of D-TGCT include swelling, pain, stiffness and reduced mobility in the affected joint or limb.:102


== Classification ==
Classification for TGCT encompasses two subtypes that can be divided according to site  within a joint (intra-articular) or outside of the joint (extra-articular)  and growth pattern (localized or diffuse) of the tumor(s).:100:361 Localized and diffuse subsets of TGCT differ in their prognosis, clinical presentation, and biological behavior, but share a similar manner of disease development.:100


=== Localized TGCT ===

Localized TGCT is sometimes referred to as localized pigmented villonodular synovitis (L-PVNS), giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath (GCT-TS), nodular tenosynovitis, localized nodular tenosynovitis, and L-TGCT.:1:100
The localized form of TGCT is more common.:100:245 Localized TGCT tumors are typically 0.5 cm-4 cm),:101 develop over years,:100 are benign and non-destructive to the surrounding tissue, and may reoccur in the affected area.:101 The most common symptom is painless swelling.:101 Localized TGCT most often occurs in fingers, but can also occur in other joints."
Intracranial Tumor-Related Hemorrhage,"Coma, strabismus, increased intracranial pressure, abnormal breathing, severe pain, headache, disappearance of the embracing reflex, increased tension in the anterior fontanel, visual agnosia, thalamic hemorrhage, precocious pubarche, pontine hemorrhage","Bleeding, hemorrhage, haemorrhage or blood loss, is blood escaping from the circulatory system from damaged blood vessels. Bleeding can occur internally, or externally either through a natural opening such as the mouth, nose, ear, urethra, vagina, or anus, or through a puncture in the skin.
Hypovolemia is a massive decrease in blood volume, and death by excessive loss of blood is referred to as exsanguination. Typically, a healthy person can endure a loss of 1015% of the total blood volume without serious medical difficulties (by comparison, blood donation typically takes 810% of the donor's blood volume). The stopping or controlling of bleeding is called hemostasis and is an important part of both first aid and surgery."
Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH),"Difficulty breathing, cyanosis, aggravated after feeding, vomiting","Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a birth defect of the diaphragm.  The most common type of CDH is a Bochdalek hernia;  other types include Morgagni hernia, diaphragm eventration and central tendon defects of the diaphragm.  Malformation of the diaphragm allows the abdominal organs to push into the chest cavity, hindering proper lung formation.
CDH is a life-threatening pathology in infants and a major cause of death due to two complications: pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension.  Experts disagree on the relative importance of these two conditions, with some focusing on hypoplasia, others on hypertension."
Pleomorphic Adenoma,"Firm swelling or nodules in the parotid region, slow growth, facial muscle weakness","Pleomorphic adenoma (or benign mixed tumor) is a common benign salivary gland neoplasm characterised by neoplastic proliferation of epithelial (ductal) cells along with myoepithelial components, having a malignant potentiality. It is the most common type of salivary gland tumor and the most common tumor of the parotid gland. It derives its name from the architectural Pleomorphism (variable appearance) seen by light microscopy. It is also known as ""Mixed tumor, salivary gland type"", which refers to its dual origin from epithelial and myoepithelial elements as opposed to its pleomorphic appearance.


== Clinical presentation ==
The tumor is usually solitary and presents as a slow growing, painless, firm single nodular mass."
Hypernatremia,"Fatigue, headache, irritability, tremors, convulsions, difficulty breathing, cough","Hyponatremia or hyponatraemia is a low concentration of sodium in the blood. It is generally defined as a sodium concentration of less than 135 mmol/L (135 mEq/L), with severe hyponatremia being below 120 mEq/L. Symptoms can be absent, mild or severe. Mild symptoms include a decreased ability to think, headaches, nausea, and poor balance. Severe symptoms include confusion, seizures, and coma; death can ensue.
The causes of hyponatremia are typically classified by a person's body fluid status into low volume, normal volume, or high volume."
Benign Duodenal Obstruction,"intestinal obstruction, abdominal pain, anemia, reduced appetite, weight loss, malnutrition, distension pain","Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) is a medical condition where there is an obstruction at the level of the pylorus, which is the outlet of the stomach.  Individuals with gastric outlet obstruction will often have recurrent vomiting of food that has accumulated in the stomach, but which cannot pass into the small intestine due to the obstruction.  The stomach often dilates to accommodate food intake and secretions.  Causes of gastric outlet obstruction include both benign causes, such as peptic ulcer disease affecting the area around the pylorus, and malignant causes, such as gastric cancer.
Causation related to ulcers may involve severe pain which the patient may interpret as a heart condition or attack."
Short P-R Syndrome,"Arrhythmia, palpitations, chest tightness, shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting","Short QT syndrome (SQT) is a very rare genetic disease of the electrical system of the heart, and is associated with an increased risk of abnormal heart rhythms and sudden cardiac death. The syndrome gets its name from a characteristic feature seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG)  a shortening of the QT interval.  It is caused by mutations in genes encoding ion channels that shorten the cardiac action potential, and appears to be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The condition is diagnosed using a 12-lead ECG.  Short QT syndrome can be treated using an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or medications including quinidine.  Short QT syndrome was first described in 2000, and the first genetic mutation associated with the condition was identified in 2004."
Crigler-Najjar Syndrome,"Jaundice, seizures, infantile spasms, opisthotonus, abdominal discomfort","CriglerNajjar syndrome is a rare inherited autosomal recessive  disorder affecting the metabolism of bilirubin, a chemical formed from the breakdown of the heme in red blood cells. The disorder results in a form of nonhemolytic jaundice, which results in high levels of unconjugated bilirubin and often leads to brain damage in infants. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The annual incidence is estimated at 0.6-1 in 1,000,000.
This syndrome is divided into types I and II, with the latter sometimes called Arias syndrome."
Pediatric Arsenic Poisoning,"Intense nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, insomnia, loss of appetite, indigestion, weight loss, polyneuritis","Arsenic poisoning (or arsenicosis) is a medical condition that occurs due to elevated levels of arsenic in the body. If arsenic poisoning occurs over a brief period of time, symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, encephalopathy, and watery diarrhea that contains blood. Long-term exposure can result in thickening of the skin, darker skin, abdominal pain, diarrhea, heart disease, numbness, and cancer.
The most common reason for long-term exposure is contaminated drinking water. Groundwater most often becomes contaminated naturally; however, contamination may also occur from mining or agriculture."
Degenerative Myopia with Choroidal Atrophy,"Decreased vision, poor corrected visual acuity, visual distortion, and floaters","Myopia, also known as near-sightedness and short-sightedness, is an eye condition where light from distant objects focuses in front of, instead of on, the retina. As a result, distant objects appear blurry, while close objects appear normal. Other symptoms may include headaches and eye strain. Severe myopia is associated with an increased risk of macular degeneration, retinal detachment, cataracts, and glaucoma.
Myopia results from the length of the eyeball growing too long or less commonly the lens being too strong."
Mediastinal Paraganglioma,"Constipation, hypotension, nausea, abdominal pain, hypertension, anxiety, tension, fear","A paraganglioma is a rare neuroendocrine neoplasm that may develop at various body sites (including the head, neck, thorax and abdomen). When the same type of tumor is found in the adrenal gland, they are referred to as a pheochromocytoma. They are rare tumors, with an overall estimated incidence of 1 in 300,000. There is no test that determines benign from malignant tumors; long-term follow-up is therefore recommended for all individuals with paraganglioma.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Most paragangliomas are asymptomatic, present as a painless mass, or create symptoms such as hypertension, tachycardia, headache, and palpitations."
Carotid Body Tumor Surgery,"Headache, difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, dizziness","A paraganglioma is a rare neuroendocrine neoplasm that may develop at various body sites (including the head, neck, thorax and abdomen).

== Signs and symptoms ==
Most paragangliomas are asymptomatic, present as a painless mass, or create symptoms such as hypertension, tachycardia, headache, and palpitations."
Clonorchiasis,"Recurrent infections, abnormal appetite, anorexia, malnutrition, obstructive jaundice, biliary colic, impaired memory, insomnia, listlessness, epigastric hidden pain, fullness after meals, fatigue","Clonorchiasis is an infectious disease caused by the Chinese liver fluke (Clonorchis sinensis) and two related species.
Clonorchiasis is a known risk factor for the development of cholangiocarcinoma, a neoplasm of the biliary system.
Symptoms of opisthorchiasis caused by Opisthorchis viverrini and by O. felineus are indistinguishable from clonorchiasis caused by Clonorchis sinensis, leading some to argue that the disease by these three parasites should be referred to collectively as clonorchiasis.


== Signs and symptoms ==


== Cause ==
Clonorchis sinensis is a trematode (fluke) which is part of the phylum Platyhelminthes. The parasitic worm is as long as 10 to 25 mm and lives in the bile ducts of the liver."
Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP),"Shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, cyanosis, cough, recurrent pneumonia, malnutrition, nodules, rales, pleural effusion, respiratory failure, chest pain, abnormal breathing","Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), also known as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), is a form of pneumonia that is caused by the yeast-like fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii.
Pneumocystis specimens are commonly found in the lungs of healthy people although it is usually not a cause for disease. However, they are a source of opportunistic infection and can cause lung infections in people with a weak immune system or other predisposing health conditions. PCP is seen in people with HIV/AIDS (who account for 30-40% of PCP cases), those using medications that suppress the immune system, and people with cancer, autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, and chronic lung disease.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms may develop over several days or weeks and may include: shortness of breath and/or difficulty breathing (of gradual onset), fever, dry/non-productive cough, weight loss, night sweats, chills, and fatigue."
Brain Tumor,"Severe headaches, projectile vomiting, vision disturbances","A brain tumor (sometimes referred more commonly as brain cancer) occurs when a group of cells within the brain turn cancerous and grow out of control, creating a mass. There are two main types of tumors: malignant (cancerous) tumors and benign (non-cancerous) tumors. These can be further classified as primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which most commonly have spread from tumors located outside the brain, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the size of the tumor and the part of the brain that is involved. Where symptoms exist, they may include headaches, seizures, problems with vision, vomiting and mental changes."
Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA),"Muscular atrophy of spinal origin, difficulty in swallowing, muscular weakness, abnormal tendon reflex, poor sucking, disappearance of tendon reflex, atrophy of the tongue muscles, muscle atrophy","Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare neuromuscular disorder that results in the loss of motor neurons and progressive muscle wasting. It is usually diagnosed in infancy or early childhood and if left untreated it is the most common genetic cause of infant death. It may also appear later in life and then have a milder course of the disease. The common feature is the progressive weakness of voluntary muscles, with the arm, leg, and respiratory muscles being affected first. Associated problems may include poor head control, difficulties swallowing, scoliosis, and joint contractures."
Uterine Leiomyosarcoma,"Abdominal pain, increased menstrual flow, prolonged menstrual period","A leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a rare malignant (cancerous) smooth muscle tumor. The word is from  leio- 'smooth'  myo- 'muscle' and  sarcoma 'tumor of connective tissue'. The stomach, bladder, uterus, blood vessels, and intestines are examples of hollow organs made up of smooth muscles where LMS can be located; however, the uterus and abdomen are the most common sites.
Although leiomyosarcomas are rare, they belong to the more common types of soft-tissue sarcoma, representing 1020% of new cases. This type of cancer is more frequently diagnosed in adults as compared to children."
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS),"Fever, myalgia, dry cough, chest tightness, headache, diarrhea, fatigue, inspiratory crackles, exertional dyspnea, sighing respiration, rales, and wheezing.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by the virus SARS-CoV-1, the first identified strain of the SARS-related coronavirus. The first known cases occurred in November 2002, and the syndrome caused the 20022004 SARS outbreak. In the 2010s, Chinese scientists traced the virus through the intermediary of Asian palm civets to cave-dwelling horseshoe bats in Xiyang Yi Ethnic Township, Yunnan.
SARS was a relatively rare disease; at the end of the epidemic in June 2003, the incidence was 8,422 cases with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 11%. No cases of SARS-CoV-1 have been reported worldwide since 2004."
Pneumoconiosis,"Shortness of breath, coughing, difficulty breathing, chest pain","Pneumoconiosis is the general term for a class of interstitial lung disease where inhalation of dust (for example, ash dust, lead particles, pollen grains etc) has caused interstitial fibrosis. The three most common types are asbestosis, silicosis, and coal miner's lung. Pneumoconiosis often causes restrictive impairment, although diagnosable pneumoconiosis can occur without measurable impairment of lung function. Depending on extent and severity, it may cause death within months or years, or it may never produce symptoms. It is usually an occupational lung disease, typically from years of dust exposure during work in mining; textile milling; shipbuilding, ship repairing, and/or shipbreaking; sandblasting; industrial tasks; rock drilling (subways or building pilings); or agriculture."
Hemorrhagic Shock,"Shock, cardiac failure, pallor, cold extremities, cold sweat, restlessness","Hypovolemic shock is a form of shock caused by severe hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume or extracellular fluid in the body). It can be caused by severe dehydration or blood loss. Hypovolemic shock is a medical emergency; if left untreated, the insufficient blood flow can cause damage to organs, leading to multiple organ failure.
In treating hypovolemic shock, it is important to determine the cause of the underlying hypovolemia, which may be the result of bleeding or other fluid losses. To minimize ischemic damage to tissues, treatment involves quickly replacing lost blood or fluids, with consideration of both rate and the type of fluids used."
Paraneoplastic Cerebellar Degeneration,"Dementia, diplopia, ataxia, dysarthria, memory impairment, hypothyroidism, psychiatric disorders, bedridden","Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) is a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with a broad variety of tumors including lung cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, Hodgkins lymphoma and others. PCD is a rare condition that occurs in less than 1% of cancer patients.
As is the case with other paraneoplastic syndromes, PCD is believed to be due to an autoimmune reaction targeted against components of the central nervous system, mostly to Purkinje cells.
It is thought to be triggered when tumor cells (in PCD, most commonly ovarian or breast cancer) ectopically express proteins normally expressed in the cerebellum. This is believed to trigger an anti-tumor immune response that may be clinically significant, but also an anti-neural immune response."
Dermatofibroma,"Papules, nodules","A dermatofibroma, or benign fibrous histiocytomas, is a benign nodule in the skin, typically on the legs, elbows or chest of an adult. It is usually painless.
It usually ranges from 0.2 to 2 cm in size but larger examples have been reported. It typically results from mild trauma such as an insect bite. Risk factors for developing multiple dermatofibromas include lupus, HIV, blood cancer and some medicines that weaken immunity."
Hepatitis B-related Nephritis,"Hematuria, Proteinuria, Turbid Urine","Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue. Some people or animals with hepatitis have no symptoms, whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hepatitis is acute if it resolves within six months, and chronic if it lasts longer than six months. Acute hepatitis can resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or (rarely) result in acute liver failure. Chronic hepatitis may progress to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer."
Thalassemia,"Jaundice, anemia, pale complexion, and poor development","Thalassemias are a group of inherited blood disorders that manifest as the production of reduced hemoglobin. Symptoms depend on the type of thalassemia and can vary from none to severe, including death. Often there is mild to severe anemia (low red blood cells or hemoglobin) as thalassemia can affect the production of red blood cells and also affect how long the red blood cells live. Symptoms include tiredness, pallor, bone problems, an enlarged spleen, jaundice, pulmonary hypertension, and dark urine. Children's' growth and development may be slower than normal."
Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL),"Limb weakness, splenomegaly, anemia, hepatomegaly, axillary lymphadenopathy, lymph node enlargement, leukocytosis, flaccidity in limbs","Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML, APL) is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a cancer of the white blood cells. In APL, there is an abnormal accumulation of immature granulocytes called promyelocytes.  The disease is characterized by a t(15;17) chromosomal translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene and is distinguished from other forms of AML by its responsiveness to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; also known as tretinoin) therapy. Acute promyelocytic leukemia was first characterized in 1957 by French and Norwegian physicians as a hyperacute fatal illness, with a median survival time of less than a week. Today, prognoses have drastically improved; 10-year survival rates are estimated to be approximately 80-90% according to one study."
Pyogenic Arthritis,"General malaise, loss of appetite, high fever, chills, rigors, joint pain, swelling, tenderness, deformity, stiffness","Acute septic arthritis, infectious arthritis, suppurative arthritis, pyogenic arthritis, osteomyelitis, or joint infection is the invasion of a joint by an infectious agent resulting in joint inflammation. Generally speaking, symptoms typically include redness, heat and pain in a single joint associated with a decreased ability to move the joint. Onset is usually rapid. Other symptoms may include fever, weakness and headache. Occasionally, more than one joint may be involved, especially in neonates, younger children and immunocompromised individuals."
Septic Shock,"Fever, drowsiness, coma, confusion, cyanosis of the lips, cold hands and feet","Septic shock is a potentially fatal medical condition that occurs when sepsis, which is organ injury or damage in response to infection, leads to dangerously low blood pressure and abnormalities in cellular metabolism. The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) defines septic shock as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Patients with septic shock can be clinically identified by requiring a vasopressor to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and having serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (>18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia. This combination is associated with hospital mortality rates greater than 40%.
The primary infection is most commonly caused by bacteria, but also may be by fungi, viruses or parasites."
Subcutaneous T-cell Lymphoma,"Fever, nodules, emaciation, weight loss","Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a class of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is a type of cancer of the immune system.  Unlike most non-Hodgkin lymphomas (which are generally B-cell-related), CTCL is caused by a mutation of T cells.  The cancerous T cells in the body initially migrate to the skin, causing various lesions to appear.  These lesions change shape as the disease progresses, typically beginning as what appears to be a rash which can be very itchy and eventually forming plaques and tumors before spreading to other parts of the body.


== Signs and symptoms ==
The presentation depends if it is mycosis fungoides or Szary syndrome, the most common, though not the only types."
Autoimmune Pancreatitis,"Abdominal pain, back pain, obstructive jaundice","Autoimmune Pancreatitis (AIP) is an increasingly recognized  type of chronic pancreatitis that can be difficult to distinguish from pancreatic carcinoma but which responds to treatment with corticosteroids, particularly prednisone. Although autoimmune pancreatitis is quite rare, it constitutes an important clinical problem for both patients and their clinicians: the disease commonly presents itself as a tumorous mass which is diagnostically indistinguishable from pancreatic cancer, a disease that is much more common in addition to being very dangerous. Hence, some patients undergo pancreatic surgery, which is associated to substantial  mortality and morbidity, out of the fear by patients and clinicians to undertreat a malignancy. However, surgery is not a good treatment for this condition as AIP responds well to immunosuppressive treatment. There are two categories of AIP: Type 1 and Type 2, each with distinct clinical profiles."
Cervical Trauma,"Cervical swelling, pain, and hemorrhage","A cervical fracture, commonly called a broken neck, is a fracture of any of the seven cervical vertebrae in the neck. Examples of common causes in humans are traffic collisions and diving into shallow water. Abnormal movement of neck bones or pieces of bone can cause a spinal cord injury, resulting in loss of sensation, paralysis, or usually death soon thereafter (~1 min.), primarily via compromising neurological supply to the respiratory muscles and innervation to the heart.


== Causes ==

Considerable force is needed to cause a cervical fracture. Vehicle collisions and falls are common causes."
Malignant Glaucoma,"Headache, eye pain, nausea, vomiting","Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can lead to damage of the optic nerve. The optic nerve transmits visual information from the eye to the brain. Glaucoma may cause vision loss if left untreated. It has been called the ""silent thief of sight"" because the loss of vision usually occurs slowly over a long period of time. A major risk factor for glaucoma is increased pressure within the eye, known as intraocular pressure (IOP)."
Intraventricular Hemorrhage,"Headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, consciousness disorder, epileptic seizures, high fever","Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), also known as intraventricular bleeding, is a bleeding into the brain's ventricular system, where the cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulates through towards the subarachnoid space.  It can result from physical trauma or from hemorrhagic stroke.
30% of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) are primary, confined to the ventricular system and typically caused by intraventricular trauma, aneurysm, vascular malformations, or tumors, particularly of the choroid plexus. However 70% of IVH are secondary in nature, resulting from an expansion of an existing intraparenchymal or subarachnoid  hemorrhage. Intraventricular hemorrhage has been found to occur in 35% of moderate to severe traumatic brain injuries."
Primary Myelofibrosis in the Elderly,"Significant splenomegaly, anemia, osteosclerosis, fatigue, low-grade fever, night sweats, weight loss, reduced appetite, fullness in the left upper or mid-upper abdomen","Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), also known as chronic myeloid leukemia, is a cancer of the white blood cells. It is a form of leukemia characterized by the increased and unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of these cells in the blood. CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) and their precursors is found; characteristic increase in basophils is clinically relevant. It is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome.
CML is largely treated with targeted drugs called tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which have led to dramatically improved long-term survival rates since 2001."
Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head (AVN),"Pain in the hip joint and groin, limping, worsening with activity and weight-bearing, reduced range of motion in the hip","Avascular necrosis (AVN), also called osteonecrosis or bone infarction, is death of bone tissue due to interruption of the blood supply. Early on, there may be no symptoms. Gradually joint pain may develop, which may limit the person's ability to move. Complications may include collapse of the bone or nearby joint surface.
Risk factors include bone fractures, joint dislocations, alcoholism, and the use of high-dose steroids."
Retinal Hemorrhage,"Floating dark shadows in front of the eyes, unclear vision in central area, vision loss","Retinal hemorrhage (UK English: retinal haemorrhage) is a disorder of the eye in which bleeding occurs in the retina, the light sensitive tissue located on the back wall of the eye.  There are photoreceptor cells in the retina called rods and cones, which transduce light energy into nerve signals that can be processed by the brain to form visual images. Retinal hemorrhage is strongly associated with child abuse in infants and young children and often leaves such abused infants permanently blind. In older children and adults, retinal hemorrhage can be caused by several medical conditions such as hypertension, retinal vein occlusion (a blockage of a retinal vein), anemia, leukemia or diabetes.


== Signs and symptoms ==
At the early stage, a retinal hemorrhage may not show any symptom at all."
Atherosclerosis,"Dizziness, angina pectoris, chest pain, headache, abnormal heart sounds, cardiac murmurs, vessel hardening, artery elongation and twisting, atherosclerotic plaque","Atherosclerosis is a pattern of the disease arteriosclerosis, characterized by development of abnormalities called lesions in walls of arteries. This is a chronic inflammatory disease involving many different cell types and is driven by elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood. These lesions may lead to narrowing of the arterial walls due to buildup of atheromatous plaques. At the onset there are usually no symptoms, but if they develop, symptoms generally begin around middle age. In severe cases, it can result in coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or kidney disorders, depending on which body part(s) the affected arteries are located in the body."
Ectopic Acute Appendicitis,"Abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting","Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. Symptoms commonly include right lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever and decreased appetite. However, approximately 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms. Severe complications of a ruptured appendix include widespread, painful inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall and sepsis.
Appendicitis is primarily caused by a blockage of the hollow portion in the appendix."
Rectal Cancer,"Changes in bowel habits, blood in stool, narrowing of stools","Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as bowel cancer, colon cancer, or rectal cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine). Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, abdominal pain and fatigue. Most colorectal cancers are due to lifestyle factors and genetic disorders. Risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red meat, processed meat, and alcohol."
Brainstem Glioma,"Headache, dizziness, vomiting, vision disorders, epilepsy, facial paralysis, limb paralysis","A brainstem glioma is a cancerous glioma tumor in the brainstem. Around 75% are diagnosed in children and young adults under the age of twenty, but have been known to affect older adults as well. Brainstem gliomas start in the brain or spinal cord tissue and typically spread throughout the nervous system.


== Classification ==
In children, brainsteam gliomas are classified as either diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) or as focal brain stem gliomas. The latter type are less aggressive and easier to treat."
Heart Failure in Elderly,"Fatigue, easy tiredness, mild chest discomfort after activities, difficulty breathing","Heart failure (HF), also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), is a syndrome caused by an impairment in the heart's ability to fill with and pump blood.
Although symptoms vary based on which side of the heart is affected, HF typically presents with shortness of breath, excessive fatigue, and bilateral leg swelling. The severity of the heart failure is mainly decided based on ejection fraction and also measured by the severity of symptoms. Other conditions that have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver disease, anemia, and thyroid disease.
Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excessive alcohol consumption, infection, and cardiomyopathy."
Anisakiasis,"Stomach pain, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, low-grade fever, diarrhea, itchy throat, cough, expectoration","Anisakis  ( a-n-SAH-keez) is a genus of parasitic nematodes that have life cycles involving fish and marine mammals. They are infective to humans and cause anisakiasis. People who produce immunoglobulin E in response to this parasite may subsequently have an allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, after eating fish infected with Anisakis species.


== Etymology ==
The genus Anisakis was defined in 1845 by Flix Dujardin as a subgenus of the genus Ascaris Linnaeus, 1758. Dujardin did not make explicit the etymology, but stated that the subgenus included the species in which the males have unequal spicules (""mles ayant des spicules ingaux""); thus, the name Anisakis is based on anis- (Greek prefix for different) and akis (Greek for spine or spicule)."
Rubber-induced Dermatosis,"Workers involved in rubber production may experience symptoms such as red maculopapular rash, itching, roughness, and fissuring on the face, neck, hands, forearms, and lower legs.","Contact dermatitis is a type of acute or chronic inflammation of the skin caused by exposure to chemical or physical agents. Symptoms of contact dermatitis can include itchy or dry skin, a red rash, bumps, blisters, or swelling. These rashes are not contagious or life-threatening, but can be very uncomfortable.
Contact dermatitis results from either exposure to allergens (allergic contact dermatitis), or irritants (irritant contact dermatitis). Allergic contact dermatitis involves a delayed type of hypersensitivity and previous exposure to an allergen to produce a reaction."
Intravascular Large B-cell Lymphoma,"Dementia, nodules, papules, reticulated purpura","Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a cancer of B cells, a type of lymphocyte that is responsible for producing antibodies. It is the most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma among adults, with an annual incidence of 78 cases per 100,000 people per year in the US and UK. This cancer occurs primarily in older individuals, with a median age of diagnosis at ~70 years, although it can occur in young adults and, in rare cases, children. DLBCL can arise in virtually any part of the body and, depending on various factors, is often a very aggressive malignancy. The first sign of this illness is typically the observation of a rapidly growing mass or tissue infiltration that is sometimes associated with systemic B symptoms, e.g. fever, weight loss, and night sweats."
Idiopathic Omental Infarction,"Constipation, low-grade fever, nausea, abdominal muscle tension, diarrhea, acute abdomen, lower abdominal pain, blood-stained exudate","Omental infarction, or omental torsion, is an acute vascular disorder which compromises tissue of the greater omentumthe largest peritoneal fold in the abdomen.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Patients will present with a sudden onset of cramps/abdominal pain or a 'stitch'. The pain localises in the area of the umbilicus and can radiate to the lumbar and surrounding regions.


== Causes ==
Omental infarction is a rare cause of acute abdomen pain with reported incidence being less than 4 per 1000 cases of appendicitis. Omental infarction usually presents as right-sided abdominal pain although seldom causing left-sided abdominal pain and even epigastric pain."
Malignant Bone Tumor,"nocturnal pain, fever, weight loss","A benign tumor is a mass of cells (tumor) that does not invade neighboring tissue or metastasize (spread throughout the body). Compared to malignant (cancerous) tumors, benign tumors generally have a slower growth rate. Benign tumors have relatively well differentiated cells. They are often surrounded by an outer surface (fibrous sheath of connective tissue) or stay contained within the epithelium. Common examples of benign tumors include moles and uterine fibroids."
Acute Abdomen,"Fever, nausea and vomiting, persistent sharp abdominal pain","An acute abdomen refers to a sudden, severe abdominal pain. It is in many cases a medical emergency, requiring urgent and specific diagnosis. Several causes need immediate surgical treatment.


== Differential diagnosis ==
Common causes of an acute abdomen include a gastrointestinal perforation, peptic ulcer disease, mesenteric ischemia, acute cholecystitis, appendicitis, diverticulitis, pancreatitis, and an abdominal hemorrhage. However, this is a non-exhaustive list and other less common causes may also lead to an acute abdomen."
Cardiac Arrest and Cardiopulmonary-Cerebral Resuscitation,"Cardiac arrest, dizziness, syncope, loss of consciousness, convulsions, cyanosis","The history of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can be traced as far back as the literary works of ancient Egypt (c.2686  c.2181 BC). However, it was not until the 18th century that credible reports of cardiopulmonary resuscitation began to appear in the medical literature.
Mouth-to-mouth ventilation has been used for centuries as an element of CPR, but it fell out of favor in the late 19th century with the widespread adoption of manual resuscitative techniques such as the Marshall Hall method, Silvester's method, the Shafer method and the Holger Nielsen technique. The technique of mouth-to-mouth ventilation would not come back into favor until the late 1950s, after its ""accidental rediscovery"" by James Elam.
The modern elements of resuscitation for sudden cardiac arrest include CPR (consisting of ventilation of the lungs and chest compressions), defibrillation and emergency medical services (the means to bring these techniques to the patient quickly)."
Gynecomastia,"Obesity, Enlarged Breasts, Increased Vocal Pitch","Gynecomastia (also spelled gynaecomastia) is the non-cancerous enlargement of one or both breasts in men due to the growth of breast tissue as a result of a hormone imbalance between estrogens and androgens. Physically speaking, gynecomastia is completely benign, but it is associated with significant psychological distress, social stigma, and dysphoria.
Gynecomastia can be normal in newborn male babies due to exposure to estrogen from the mother, in adolescent boys going through puberty, in older men over the age of 50, and in obese men. Most occurrences of gynecomastia do not require diagnostic tests. Gynecomastia may be caused by abnormal hormone changes, any condition that leads to an increase in the ratio of estrogens/androgens such as liver disease, kidney failure, thyroid disease and some non-breast tumors."
Coagulopathy,"Bleeding from gums or nose, subcutaneous bruising, heavy menstrual bleeding","Coagulopathy (also called a bleeding disorder) is a condition in which the blood's ability to coagulate (form clots) is impaired. This condition can cause a tendency toward prolonged or excessive bleeding (bleeding diathesis), which may occur spontaneously or following an injury or medical and dental procedures.
Coagulopathies are sometimes erroneously referred to as ""clotting disorders"", but a clotting disorder is the opposite, defined as a predisposition to excessive clot formation (thrombus), also known as a hypercoagulable state or thrombophilia.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Coagulopathy may cause uncontrolled internal or external bleeding. Left untreated, uncontrolled bleeding may cause damage to joints, muscles, or internal organs and may be life-threatening."
Secondary Pyogenic Peritonitis,"Abdominal pain, bloating, nausea and vomiting, signs of sepsis, acute abdominal pain, tympanic abdomen, forced supine position, flexion of the left abdomen, postpartum lower abdominal pain or a feeling of dragging in the vagina, reduced or absent abdominal wall reflexes, non-bloody ascites, gas passing disorder.","Peritonitis is inflammation of the localized or generalized peritoneum, the lining of the inner wall of the abdomen and covering of the abdominal organs. Symptoms may include severe pain, swelling of the abdomen, fever, or weight loss. One part or the entire abdomen may be tender. Complications may include shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Causes include perforation of the intestinal tract, pancreatitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, stomach ulcer, cirrhosis, a ruptured appendix or even a perforated gallbladder."
Noise-induced Hearing Loss,Auditory fatigue that gradually recovers after leaving the noisy environment,"Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a hearing impairment resulting from exposure to loud sound. People may have a loss of perception of a narrow range of frequencies or impaired perception of sound including sensitivity to sound or ringing in the ears. When exposure to hazards such as noise occur at work and is associated with hearing loss, it is referred to as occupational hearing loss.
Hearing may deteriorate gradually from chronic and repeated noise exposure (such as to loud music or background noise) or suddenly from exposure to impulse noise, which is a short high intensity noise (such as a gunshot or airhorn). In both types, loud sound overstimulates delicate hearing cells, leading to the permanent injury or death of the cells."
Medulloblastoma,"Headache, nausea, vomiting, disinterest, dementia, intellectual deterioration, hemiplegia, hemisensory disorders, aphasia, and hemianopia","Medulloblastoma is a common type of primary brain cancer in children. It originates in the part of the brain that is towards the back and the bottom, on the floor of the skull, in the cerebellum, or posterior fossa.
The brain is divided into two main parts, the larger cerebrum on top and the smaller cerebellum below towards the back. They are separated by a membrane called the tentorium. Tumors that originate in the cerebellum or the surrounding region below the tentorium are, therefore, called infratentorial."
Intestinal Amebiasis,"Bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, vomiting","Amoebiasis, or amoebic dysentery, is an infection of the intestines caused by a parasitic amoeba Entamoeba histolytica. Amoebiasis can be present with no, mild, or severe symptoms. Symptoms may include lethargy, loss of weight, colonic ulcerations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or bloody diarrhea. Complications can include inflammation and ulceration of the colon with tissue death or perforation, which may result in peritonitis. Anemia may develop due to prolonged gastric bleeding."
Renal Hamartoma,"Brain development disorders, gastrointestinal symptoms, lower back pain, intellectual impairment, epilepsy, facial sebaceous adenomas","A hamartoma is a mostly benign, local malformation of cells that resembles a neoplasm of local tissue but is usually due to an overgrowth of multiple aberrant cells, with a basis in a systemic genetic condition, rather than a growth descended from a single mutated cell (monoclonality), as would typically define a benign neoplasm/tumor. Despite this, many hamartomas are found to have clonal chromosomal aberrations that are acquired through somatic mutations, and on this basis the term hamartoma is sometimes considered synonymous with neoplasm. Hamartomas are by definition benign, slow-growing or self-limiting, though the underlying condition may still predispose the individual towards malignancies.
Hamartomas are usually caused by a genetic syndrome that affects the development cycle of all or at least multiple cells. Many of these conditions are classified as overgrowth syndromes or cancer syndromes."
Primary Effusion Lymphoma (PEL),"Ascites, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion","Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is classified as a diffuse large B cell lymphoma. It is a rare malignancy of plasmablastic cells that occurs in individuals that are infected with the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (i.e. KSHV/HHV8). Plasmablasts are immature plasma cells, i.e. lymphocytes of the B-cell type that have differentiated into plasmablasts but because of their malignant nature do not differentiate  into mature plasma cells but rather proliferate excessively and thereby cause life-threatening disease."
Chondromyxoid Fibroma,"Characterized by regular, hard bone expansion with clear boundaries.","Fibromas are benign tumors that are composed of fibrous or connective tissue. They can grow in all organs, arising from mesenchyme  tissue. The term ""fibroblastic"" or ""fibromatous"" is used to describe tumors of the fibrous connective tissue. When the term fibroma is used without modifier, it is usually considered benign, with the term fibrosarcoma reserved for malignant tumors.


== Types ==


=== Hard fibroma ===
The hard fibroma (fibroma durum) consists of many fibres and few cells, e.g."
Retroperitoneal Fluid Infiltration Disease,"Loss of psoas major shadow, shock, abdominal pain, diarrhea","ErdheimChester disease (ECD)  is an extremely rare disease classified as a non-Langerhans-cell histiocytic neoplasm. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined ECD as a slow-growing blood cancer that may originate in the bone marrow or precursor cells. Typical onset occurs in middle aged individuals, although pediatric cases have been documented. The exact cause of ECD remains unknown, though it is believed to be linked to an exaggerated TH1 immune response. The disease involves an infiltration of lipid-laden macrophages, multi-nucleated giant cells, an inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes and histiocytes in the bone marrow, and a generalized sclerosis of the long bones."
Cutaneous Horn,"The skin lesion manifests as a cutaneous-colored, yellow, or grayish-white keratinous protrusion, commonly occurring on the face and head.","Cutaneous horns, also known by the Latin name cornu cutaneum, are unusual keratinous skin tumors with the appearance of horns, or sometimes of wood or coral. Formally, this is a clinical diagnosis for a ""conical projection above the surface of the skin."" They are usually small and localized but can, in very rare cases, be much larger. Although often benign, they can also be malignant or premalignant.


== Signs and symptoms ==
The lesion at the base of the keratin mound is benign in the majority of cases. Malignancy is present in up to 20% of cases, with squamous-cell carcinoma being the most common type."
Hemoptysis,"Chest and back pain, coughing up blood, accompanied by chills and fever, cough, vomiting, shortness of breath","Hemoptysis or haemoptysis is the discharge of blood or blood-stained mucus through the mouth coming from the bronchi, larynx, trachea, or lungs. It does not necessarily involve coughing. In other words, it is the airway bleeding. This can occur with lung cancer, infections such as tuberculosis, bronchitis, or pneumonia, and certain cardiovascular conditions. Hemoptysis is considered massive at 300 mL (11 imp fl oz; 10 US fl oz)."
Pediatric Sarcoma Botryoides,"Vaginal bloody discharge, irregular vaginal bleeding","Sarcoma botryoides or botryoid sarcoma is a subtype of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, that can be observed in the walls of hollow, mucosa lined structures such as the nasopharynx, common bile duct, urinary bladder of infants and young children or the vagina in females, typically younger than age 8. The name comes from Ancient Greek  botryoid 'grape bunch' due to their gross appearance.


== Presentation ==
For botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma of the vagina, the most common clinical finding is vaginal bleeding but vaginal bleeding is not specific for sarcoma botryoides:  other vaginal cancers are possible. They may appear as a polypoid mass, somewhat yellow in color and are friable: thus, they (possibly) may break off, leading to vaginal bleeding or infections.


== Histology ==
Under the microscope one can see rhabdomyoblasts that may contain cross-striations."
Hypokalemia,"Muscular weakness, episodic paralysis, limb numbness, convulsions with weakness, thyrotoxic crisis, low blood potassium, heart failure, respiratory abnormalities, arrhythmias, metabolic hypokalemia, decreased intestinal motility, lack of appetite, abdominal distension, nausea, constipation","Hypokalemia is a low level of potassium (K+) in the blood serum. Mild low potassium does not typically cause symptoms. Symptoms may include feeling tired, leg cramps, weakness, and constipation. Low potassium also increases the risk of an abnormal heart rhythm, which is often too slow and can cause cardiac arrest.
Causes of hypokalemia include vomiting, diarrhea, medications like furosemide and steroids, dialysis, diabetes insipidus, hyperaldosteronism, hypomagnesemia, and not enough intake in the diet."
Lethal Midline Granuloma,"Ulcers, Nasal obstruction, Sneezing, Rhinorrhea, Mucosal dryness, Purulent or bloody nasal discharge","Lethal midline granuloma (LMG) is an historical term for a condition in which necrotic and highly destructive lesions develop progressively in the middle of the face, principally the nose and palate. Many cases presented with ulcerations in or perforations of the palate.
LMG was thought to be a manifestation of three or four different diseases: the well-characterized disease of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, the ill-defined disorders of polymorphic reticulosis or mid-line malignant reticulosis, and an incompletely defined form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Subsequent studies found that the cells infiltrating the midline tissues in cases of lethal midline granuloma that were not clearly diagnosed as granulomatosis with polyangiitis were: a) infected by the EpsteinBarr virus and b) consisted of malignant lymphocytes, usually NK cells or, rarely, cytotoxic T cells. The disease is therefore now regarded as a NK/T cell malignancy, is grouped with other EpsteinBarr virusassociated lymphoproliferative diseases and is classified by the World Health Organization (2017 update) as a manifestation of the well-defined disease, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTCL-NT)."
Pediatric Ventricular Tachycardia,"Palpitations, chest tightness, fatigue, shortness of breath, cyanosis, angina, shock, generalized sweating, rapid heartbeat, sudden death, respiratory failure, abnormal heart sounds","Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited genetic disorder that predisposes those affected to potentially life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms or arrhythmias. The arrhythmias seen in CPVT typically occur during exercise or at times of emotional stress, and classically take the form of bidirectional ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Those affected may be asymptomatic, but they may also experience blackouts or even sudden cardiac death.
CPVT is caused by genetic mutations affecting proteins that regulate the concentrations of calcium within cardiac muscle cells. The most commonly identified gene is RYR2, which encodes a protein included in an ion channel known as the ryanodine receptor; this channel releases calcium from a cell's internal calcium store, the sarcoplasmic reticulum, during every heartbeat."
Pediatric Diabetic Nephropathy,"High blood pressure, edema, blurry vision, urinary urgency, frequent urination","Diabetes, also known as diabetes  mellitus, is a group of common endocrine diseases characterized by sustained high blood sugar levels. Diabetes is due to either the pancreas not producing enough of the hormone insulin, or the cells of the body becoming unresponsive to insulin's effects. Classic symptoms include polydipsia (excessive thirst), polyuria (excessive urination), polyphagia (excessive hunger), weight loss, and blurred vision. If left untreated, the disease can lead to various health complications, including disorders of the cardiovascular system, eye, kidney, and nerves. Diabetes accounts for approximately 4.2 million deaths every year, with an estimated 1.5 million caused by either untreated or poorly treated diabetes."
Oral Cancer with Cutaneous Metastasis,"Multiple nodules, ulcers, skin metastases, solitary solid nodules, squamous cell carcinoma","Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (cSCC), also known as squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous-cell skin cancer, is one of the three principal types of skin cancer, alongside basal-cell carcinoma and melanoma. cSCC typically presents as a hard lump with a scaly surface, though it may also present as an ulcer. Onset and development often occurs over several months.
Compared to basal cell carcinoma, cSCC  is more likely to spread to distant areas. When confined to the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin, the pre-invasive or in situ form of cSCC is termed Bowen's disease."
Mucormycosis,"Fever, coughing, hemoptysis, dyspnea, subcutaneous nodules, ulcers, chest pain, headache, somnolence, orbital pain, ptosis, nodes","Mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, is a severe fungal infection that comes under fulminant fungal sinusitis, usually in people who are immunocompromised. It is curable only when diagnosed early. Symptoms depend on where in the body the infection occurs. It most commonly infects the nose, sinuses, eyes and brain resulting in a runny nose, one-sided facial swelling and pain, headache, fever, blurred vision, bulging or displacement of the eye (proptosis), and tissue death. Other forms of disease may infect the lungs, stomach and intestines, and skin."
Botulism,"Headache, nausea and vomiting, diplopia, dizziness, abnormal pupils, cyanosis of the skin and mucous membranes, eye pain, abnormal defecation frequency, paralysis, swallowing difficulties, sore throat, and 'pseudo paralysis' of the shoulder girdle","Botulism is a rare and potentially fatal illness caused by botulinum toxin, which is produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The disease begins with weakness, blurred vision, feeling tired, and trouble speaking. This may then be followed by weakness of the arms, chest muscles, and legs. Vomiting, swelling of the abdomen, and diarrhea may also occur. The disease does not usually affect consciousness or cause a fever."
Sepsis,"High fever, vomiting, skin petechiae, bruises, lethargy, coma","Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
This initial stage of sepsis is followed by suppression of the immune system. Common signs and symptoms include fever, increased heart rate, increased breathing rate, and confusion. There may also be symptoms related to a specific infection, such as a cough with pneumonia, or painful urination with a kidney infection. The very young, old, and people with a weakened immune system may not have any symptoms that are specific to their infection, and their body temperature may be low or normal instead of constituting a fever."
Inflammatory Glaucoma,"Heterochromia iridis, uveitis, photophobia, elevated intraocular pressure, iris inflammation, abnormal pupil, increased black spots in front of the eye","Secondary glaucoma is a collection of progressive optic nerve disorders associated with a rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) which results in the loss of vision. In clinical settings, it is defined as the occurrence of IOP above 21 mmHg requiring the prescription of IOP-managing drugs. It can be broadly divided into two subtypes: secondary open-angle glaucoma and secondary angle-closure glaucoma, depending on the closure of the angle between the cornea and the iris. Principal causes of secondary glaucoma include optic nerve trauma or damage, eye disease, surgery, neovascularization, tumours and use of steroid and sulfa drugs. Risk factors for secondary glaucoma include uveitis, cataract surgery and also intraocular tumours."
Geriatric Cerebral Embolism,"Hemianopia, hemisensory disturbances, disturbances of consciousness, hemiplegia, motor aphasia, sensory disturbances, chest oppression, hemoptysis, angina pectoris, dyspnea","Stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to a part of the brain causes cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. Both cause parts of the brain to stop functioning properly.
Signs and symptoms of stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, dizziness, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred."
Primary Bone Lymphoma,"Bone pain, fatigue, fever, muscle soreness","Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), also known as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, is a group of blood cancers that includes all types of lymphomas except Hodgkin lymphomas. Symptoms include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and tiredness. Other symptoms may include bone pain, chest pain, or itchiness. Some forms are slow-growing while others are fast-growing. Unlike Hodgkin lymphoma, which spreads contiguously, NHL is largely a systemic illness."
Cerebellar Tonsillar Herniation,"Facial numbness, diplopia, tinnitus, hearing impairment, difficulty in articulation and swallowing, pain in the suboccipital region","Brain herniation is a potentially deadly side effect of very high pressure within the skull that occurs when a part of the brain is squeezed across structures within the skull. The brain can shift across such structures as the falx cerebri, the tentorium cerebelli, and even through the foramen magnum (the hole in the base of the skull through which the spinal cord connects with the brain).  Herniation can be caused by a number of factors that cause a mass effect and increase intracranial pressure (ICP): these include traumatic brain injury, intracranial hemorrhage, or brain tumor.
Herniation can also occur in the absence of high ICP when mass lesions such as hematomas occur at the borders of brain compartments. In such cases local pressure is increased at the place where the herniation occurs, but this pressure is not transmitted to the rest of the brain, and therefore does not register as an increase in ICP.
Because herniation puts extreme pressure on parts of the brain and thereby cuts off the blood supply to various parts of the brain, it is often fatal."
Cholangiocarcinoma,"Jaundice, abdominal discomfort, loss of appetite, weight loss, itching","Cholangiocarcinoma, also known as bile duct cancer, is a type of cancer that forms in the bile ducts. Symptoms of cholangiocarcinoma may include abdominal pain, yellowish skin, weight loss, generalized itching, and fever. Light colored stool or dark urine may also occur. Other biliary tract cancers include gallbladder cancer and cancer of the ampulla of Vater.
Risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma include primary sclerosing cholangitis (an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts), ulcerative colitis, cirrhosis, hepatitis C, hepatitis B, infection with certain liver flukes, and some congenital liver malformations."
Arteriosclerotic Occlusive Disease,"Limb coldness, numbness in limbs or torso, intermittent claudication, absence of dorsalis pedis arterial pulse, weakened or absent popliteal artery pulse, decreased dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial artery pulse, and ischemia below the calf.","Atherosclerosis is a pattern of the disease arteriosclerosis, characterized by development of abnormalities called lesions in walls of arteries. This is a chronic inflammatory disease involving many different cell types and is driven by elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood. These lesions may lead to narrowing of the arterial walls due to buildup of atheromatous plaques. At the onset there are usually no symptoms, but if they develop, symptoms generally begin around middle age. In severe cases, it can result in coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or kidney disorders, depending on which body part(s) the affected arteries are located in the body."
Silent Myocardial Infarction,"Nausea, vomiting, palpitations, shortness of breath, hypotension, upper abdominal discomfort, shock, toothache, toe pain, disturbance of consciousness, chest tightness, abdominal discomfort, general malaise","A myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops in one of the coronary arteries of the heart, causing infarction (tissue death) to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is retrosternal chest pain or discomfort that classically radiates to the left shoulder, arm, or jaw. The pain may occasionally feel like heartburn. This is the dangerous type of acute coronary syndrome.
Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, feeling tired, and decreased level of consciousness."
Ocular Hypertension,"Eye pain, blurred vision, eye fatigue","Ocular hypertension is the presence of elevated fluid pressure inside the eye (intraocular pressure), usually with no optic nerve damage or visual field loss.
For most individuals, the normal range of intraocular pressure is between 10 mmHg and 21 mmHg. It is estimated that approximately 2-3% of people aged 52-89 years old have ocular hypertension of 25 mmHg and higher, and 3.5% of people 49 years and older have ocular hypertension of 21 mmHg and higher.
 Elevated intraocular pressure is an important risk factor and symptom of glaucoma. Accordingly, most individuals with consistently elevated intraocular pressures of greater than 21mmHg, particularly if they have other risk factors, are treated in an effort to prevent vision loss from glaucoma."
Renal Cyst,"Lower back pain, abdominal mass, hematuria","A renal cyst  is a fluid collection in or on the kidney. There are several types based on the Bosniak classification. The majority are benign, simple cysts that can be monitored and not intervened upon. However, some are cancerous or are suspicious for cancer and are commonly removed in a surgical procedure called nephrectomy.
Numerous renal cysts are seen in the cystic kidney diseases, which include polycystic kidney disease and medullary sponge kidney."
Pediatric Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency,"Diarrhea, meningitis, eversion of infant ribs, tremors, deafness, intellectual developmental delay","Deficiency of Adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2) is a monogenic disease associated with systemic inflammation and vasculopathy that affects a wide variety of organs in different patients.  As a result, it is hard to characterize a patient with this disorder. Manifestations of the disease  include but are not limited to recurrent fever, livedoid rash (reticularis or racemosa), various cytopenias, stroke, immunodeficiency, and bone marrow failure. Symptoms often onset during early childhood, but some cases have been discovered as late as 65 years old.
DADA2 is caused by mutations in the ADA2 gene, and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner."
Pediatric Adhesive Intestinal Obstruction,"Persistent or sporadic abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, cessation of bowel movements and gas passage","Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. Symptoms commonly include right lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever and decreased appetite. However, approximately 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms. Severe complications of a ruptured appendix include widespread, painful inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall and sepsis.
Appendicitis is primarily caused by a blockage of the hollow portion in the appendix."
Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN),"Oliguria or anuria, hematuria, heavy proteinuria, edema, purpura","Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is a syndrome of the kidney that is characterized by a rapid loss of kidney function, (usually a 50% decline in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) within 3 months) with glomerular crescent formation seen in at least 50% or 75% of glomeruli seen on kidney biopsies. If left untreated, it rapidly progresses into acute kidney failure and death within months. In 50% of cases, RPGN is associated with an underlying disease such as Goodpasture syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus or granulomatosis with polyangiitis; the remaining cases are idiopathic. Regardless of the underlying cause, RPGN involves severe injury to the kidneys' glomeruli, with many of the glomeruli containing characteristic glomerular crescents (crescent-shaped scars).


== Signs and symptoms ==
Most types of RPGN are characterized by severe and rapid loss of kidney function with marked hematuria; red blood cell casts in the urine; and proteinuria sometimes exceeding three grams in twenty-four hours, a range associated with nephrotic syndrome."
Neuroendocrine Tumor Skin Metastasis,"Metastases with unknown primary foci, nodules, acne during menstrual periods, inaccurate finger-to-nose coordination, black nails, overall lowered metabolism","Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous systems. They most commonly occur in the intestine, where they are often called carcinoid tumors, but they are also found in the pancreas, lung, and the rest of the body.
Although there are many kinds of NETs, they are treated as a group of tissue because the cells of these neoplasms share common features, including a similar histological appearance, having special secretory granules, and often producing biogenic amines and polypeptide hormones.
The term ""neuro"" refers to the dense core granules (DCGs), similar to the DCGs in the serotonergic neurons storing monoamines. The term ""endocrine"" refers to the synthesis and secretion of these monoamines."
Soft Tissue Sarcoma,"Pain, lymph node enlargement, dull ache","A soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) is a malignant tumor, a type of cancer, that develops in soft tissue. A soft-tissue sarcoma is often a painless mass that grows slowly over months or years. They may be superficial or deep-seated. Any such unexplained mass must be diagnosed by biopsy. Treatment may include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted drug therapy."
Hypotension,"Dizziness, fatigue, poor digestion, insufficient blood supply to the heart and brain, reduced endocrine function, chronic headache, precordial pain, lower extremity hypotension, and weak knees and back","Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms itself. It is, however, a major risk factor for stroke, coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, vision loss, chronic kidney disease, and dementia. Hypertension is a major cause of premature death worldwide.
High blood pressure is classified as primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension."
Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB),"Skin is extremely fragile, recurring blisters result from minor friction or trauma.",Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of rare medical conditions that result in easy blistering of the skin and mucous membranes. Blisters occur with minor trauma or friction and are painful. Its severity can range from mild to fatal. Inherited EB is a rare disease with a prevalence in the United States of 8.2 per million live births. Those with mild cases may not develop symptoms until they start to crawl or walk.
Elderly Bronchial Asthma,"Cough, expectoration of large amounts of white foamy sputum, wheezing, orthopnea, palpitations, and chest tightness","Cardiac asthma is the medical condition of intermittent wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath that is associated with underlying congestive heart failure (CHF). Symptoms of cardiac asthma are related to the heart's inability to effectively and efficiently pump blood in a CHF patient. This can lead to accumulation of fluid in and around the lungs (pulmonary congestion), disrupting the lung's ability to oxygenate blood.
Cardiac asthma carries similar symptoms to bronchial asthma, but is differentiated by lacking inflammatory origin. Because of the similarity in symptoms, diagnosis of cardiac versus bronchial asthma relies on full cardiac workup and pulmonary function testing."
Lymphoma,"Abnormal appetite, lymphadenopathy, localized lymph node enlargement","Lymphoma is a group of blood and lymph tumors that develop from lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). The name typically refers to just the cancerous versions rather than all such tumours. Signs and symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, drenching sweats, unintended weight loss, itching, and constantly feeling tired. The enlarged lymph nodes are usually painless. The sweats are most common at night."
Traumatic Hemothorax,"Shock, hemothorax, hemoperitoneum, dyspnea, shifting of trachea and mediastinum, high fever with chills, chest pain, empyema","A hemothorax (derived from hemo- [blood] + thorax [chest], plural hemothoraces) is an accumulation of blood within the pleural cavity. The symptoms of a hemothorax may include chest pain and difficulty breathing, while the clinical signs may include reduced breath sounds on the affected side and a rapid heart rate. Hemothoraces are usually caused by an injury, but they may occur spontaneously due to cancer invading the pleural cavity, as a result of a blood clotting disorder, as an unusual manifestation of endometriosis, in response to pneumothorax, or rarely in association with other conditions.
Hemothoraces are usually diagnosed using a chest X-ray, but they can be identified using other forms of imaging including ultrasound, a CT scan, or an MRI. They can be differentiated from other forms of fluid within the pleural cavity by analysing a sample of the fluid, and are defined as having a hematocrit of greater than 50% that of the person's blood. Hemothoraces may be treated by draining the blood using a chest tube."
Adolescent and Pediatric Vaginal Rhabdomyosarcoma,"The tumor has a smooth appearance, is fixed, and feels cystic upon palpation.","Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a highly aggressive form of cancer that develops from mesenchymal cells that have failed to fully differentiate into myocytes of skeletal muscle. Cells of the tumor are identified as rhabdomyoblasts.
The four subtypes are embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, and spindle-cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma. Embryonal and alveolar are the main groups, and these types are the most common soft tissue sarcomas of childhood and adolescence. The pleomorphic type is usually found in adults."
Spindle Cell Hemangioma,Subcutaneous nodules,"Hemangioendotheliomas are a family of vascular neoplasms of intermediate malignancy.


== Signs and symptoms ==
They have been described as masses that fall between a hemangioma and angiosarcoma.  They are vascular tumors that commonly present with an enlarging mass and most commonly involve the lungs, liver, and musculoskeletal system, although many other body sites have been reported, including the head and neck, intestines, lymph nodes, pleura, retroperitoneum, heel, stomach.


== Cause ==
Possibly Bartonella spp bacteraemia


== Diagnosis ==


=== Classification ===
Hemangioendotheliomas may be classified as:

Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is an uncommon vascular tumor of intermediate malignancy that was first described by Steven Billings, Andrew Folpe, and Sharon Weiss in 2003. These tumors are so named because their histologic appearance resembles a proliferation of epithelioid cells, with polygonal shape and eosinophilic cytoplasm."
Subungual Exostosis,"Symptoms of subungual exostosis include subungual hemorrhage, nodulation, wrinkling of skin lesions under cold stimulation, and the growth of knee-long bone spurs within the toe nails.","Subungual exostosis is a type of non-cancerous bone tumor of the chondrogenic type, and consists of bone and cartilage. It usually projects from the upper surface of the big toe underlying the nailbed, giving rise to a painful swelling that destroys the nail. Subsequent ulceration and infection may occur.
There is an association with trauma and infection. Diagnosis involves medical imaging to exclude other similar conditions, particularly osteochondroma."
Cerebral Edema,"Headache, worsening vomiting, restlessness, drowsiness or even coma, vision changes, papilledema","Cerebral edema is excess accumulation of fluid (edema) in the intracellular or extracellular spaces of the brain. This typically causes impaired nerve function, increased pressure within the skull, and can eventually lead to direct compression of brain tissue and blood vessels. Symptoms vary based on the location and extent of edema and generally include headaches, nausea, vomiting, seizures, drowsiness, visual disturbances, dizziness, and in severe cases, death.
Cerebral edema is commonly seen in a variety of brain injuries including ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, subdural, epidural, or intracerebral hematoma, hydrocephalus, brain cancer, brain infections, low blood sodium levels, high altitude, and acute liver failure. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and physical examination findings and confirmed by serial neuroimaging (computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging)."
Lead Poisoning-Induced Hemolytic Anemia,"Headache, dizziness, jaundice, abdominal pain, anemic appearance, vertigo, constipation, fatigue","Hemolytic anemia or haemolytic anaemia is a form of anemia due to hemolysis, the abnormal breakdown of red blood cells (RBCs), either in the blood vessels (intravascular hemolysis) or elsewhere in the human body (extravascular). This most commonly occurs within the spleen, but also can occur in the reticuloendothelial system or mechanically (prosthetic valve damage). Hemolytic anemia accounts for 5% of all existing anemias. It has numerous possible consequences, ranging from general symptoms to life-threatening systemic effects. The general classification of hemolytic anemia is either intrinsic or extrinsic."
Gastric Volvulus,"Hematemesis and melena, gastric and intestinal bloating, abdominal pain, tenderness, dyspnea, chest pain, indigestion, burning sensation, abdominal distension, borborygmi","Gastric volvulus or volvulus of stomach is a twisting of all or part of the stomach by more than 180 degrees with obstruction of the flow of material through the stomach, variable loss of blood supply and possible tissue death. The twisting can occur around the long axis of the stomach, called organoaxial, or around the axis perpendicular to this, called mesenteroaxial. Obstruction is more likely with organoaxial twisting than with mesenteroaxial, while the latter is more associated with ischemia. About one third of the cases are associated with a hiatal hernia. Treatment is surgical."
Lassa Fever,"Maculopapular rash, congestion, proteinuria, hypotension, tinnitus, abdominal tenderness, abdominal pain, diarrhea","Lassa fever, also known as Lassa hemorrhagic fever, is a type of viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus. Many of those infected by the virus do not develop symptoms. When symptoms occur they typically include fever, weakness, headaches, vomiting, and muscle pains. Less commonly there may be bleeding from the mouth or gastrointestinal tract. The risk of death once infected is about one percent and frequently occurs within two weeks of the onset of symptoms."
Magnesium Deficiency,"Anorexia, nausea and vomiting, weakness, involuntary movements","Magnesium deficiency is an electrolyte disturbance in which there is a low level of magnesium in the body. Symptoms include tremor, poor coordination, muscle spasms, loss of appetite, personality changes, and nystagmus. Complications may include seizures or cardiac arrest such as from torsade de pointes. Those with low magnesium often have low potassium.
Causes include low dietary intake, alcoholism, diarrhea, increased urinary loss, and poor absorption from the intestines."
Prostate Sarcoma,"Appearances are mostly oval in shape, with a soft and pliable texture.","A sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that arises from cells of mesenchymal origin. Originating from mesenchymal cells means that sarcomas are cancers of connective tissues such as bone, cartilage, muscle, fat, or vascular tissues. 
Sarcomas are one of five different types of cancer, classified by the cell type from which they originate. While there are five types under this category, sarcomas are most frequently contrasted with carcinomas which are much more common. Sarcomas are quite rare, making up about 1% of all adult cancer diagnoses and 15% of childhood cancer diagnoses."
Pediatric Soft Tissue Sarcoma,"Tumor compression, tumor traction, masses","A sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that arises from cells of mesenchymal origin. Originating from mesenchymal cells means that sarcomas are cancers of connective tissues such as bone, cartilage, muscle, fat, or vascular tissues. 
Sarcomas are one of five different types of cancer, classified by the cell type from which they originate. While there are five types under this category, sarcomas are most frequently contrasted with carcinomas which are much more common. Sarcomas are quite rare, making up about 1% of all adult cancer diagnoses and 15% of childhood cancer diagnoses."
Hepatorenal Syndrome,"Hematuria, jaundice, spider angiomas, palmar erythema, splenomegaly, ascites, edema of legs and feet, eyelid edema","Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a life-threatening medical condition that consists of rapid deterioration in kidney function in individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. HRS is usually fatal unless a liver transplant is performed, although various treatments, such as dialysis, can prevent advancement of the condition.
HRS can affect individuals with cirrhosis, severe alcoholic hepatitis, or liver failure, and usually occurs when liver function deteriorates rapidly because of a sudden insult such as an infection, bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, or overuse of diuretic medications.  HRS is a relatively common complication of cirrhosis, occurring in 18% of people within one year of their diagnosis, and in 39% within five years of their diagnosis. Deteriorating liver function is believed to cause changes in the circulation that supplies the intestines, altering blood flow and blood vessel tone in the kidneys."
Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR),"The uterus of the pregnant woman is significantly smaller than the gestational age, fetal survival, weak fetal movements, and growth retardation. Equivalent to fetal intrauterine growth retardation.","Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), or fetal growth restriction, is the poor growth of a fetus while in the womb during pregnancy. IUGR is defined by clinical features of malnutrition and evidence of reduced growth regardless of an infant's birth weight percentile. The causes of IUGR are broad and may involve maternal, fetal, or placental complications.
At least 60% of the 4 million neonatal deaths that occur worldwide every year are associated with low birth weight, caused by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm delivery, and genetic abnormalities, demonstrating that under-nutrition is already a leading health problem at birth.
Intrauterine growth restriction can result in a baby being small for gestational age (SGA), which is most commonly defined as a weight below the 10th percentile for the gestational age."
Aspergillosis,"Fever, lung infection, difficulty breathing, keratitis, fungemia, cough, productive cough, hemoptysis","Aspergillosis is a fungal infection of usually the lungs, caused by the genus Aspergillus, a common mold that is breathed in frequently from the air, but does not usually affect most people. It generally occurs in people with lung diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis or tuberculosis, or those who are immunocompromised such as those who have had a stem cell or organ transplant or those who take medications such as steroids and some cancer treatments which suppress the immune system. Rarely, it can affect skin.
Aspergillosis occurs in humans, birds and other animals. Aspergillosis occurs in chronic or acute forms which are clinically very distinct."
Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA),"Fever, cough, asthma, weight loss, muscular pain, subcutaneous nodules, purpura, ulcers","Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly known as  allergic granulomatosis, is an extremely rare autoimmune condition that causes inflammation of small and medium-sized blood vessels (vasculitis) in persons with a history of airway allergic hypersensitivity (atopy).
It usually manifests in three stages. The early (prodromal) stage is marked by airway inflammation; almost all patients experience asthma and/or allergic rhinitis. The second stage is characterized by abnormally high numbers of eosinophils (hypereosinophilia), which causes tissue damage, most commonly to the lungs and the digestive tract. The third stage consists of vasculitis, which can eventually lead to cell death and can be life-threatening."
Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC),"Microcirculation disorders, bleeding, hemolysis, acrocyanosis, cyanosis, oliguria, hypotension","Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a condition in which blood clots form throughout the body, blocking small blood vessels. Symptoms may include chest pain, shortness of breath, leg pain, problems speaking, or problems moving parts of the body. As clotting factors and platelets are used up, bleeding may occur. This may include blood in the urine, blood in the stool, or bleeding into the skin. Complications may include organ failure."
Pancreatic Cancer in the Elderly,"Abdominal pain, cachexia, jaundice, abdominal mass, steatorrhea, weight loss, visceral pain, neuralgia, distension, occult pain, dull pain, right upper quadrant pain","Gastrointestinal cancer refers to malignant conditions of the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and accessory organs of digestion, including the esophagus, stomach, biliary system, pancreas, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and anus. The symptoms relate to the organ affected and can include obstruction (leading to difficulty swallowing or defecating), abnormal bleeding or other associated problems. The diagnosis often requires endoscopy, followed by biopsy of suspicious tissue. The treatment depends on the location of the tumor, as well as the type of cancer cell and whether it has invaded other tissues or spread elsewhere. These factors also determine the prognosis."
Human Papillomavirus Infection,"Warts on the vulva, itching, and easy bleeding upon touch","Human papillomavirus infection (HPV infection) is caused by a DNA virus from the Papillomaviridae family. Many HPV infections cause no symptoms and 90% resolve spontaneously within two years. In some cases, an HPV infection persists and results in either warts or precancerous lesions. All warts are caused by HPV. These lesions, depending on the site affected, increase the risk of cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, mouth, tonsils, or throat. Nearly all cervical cancer is due to HPV, and two strains  HPV16 and HPV18  account for 70% of all cases."
Pulmonary Valve Stenosis,"Chest tightness, shortness of breath, suffocation","Pulmonary valve stenosis (PVS) is a heart valve disorder. Blood going from the heart to the lungs goes through the pulmonary valve, whose purpose is to prevent blood from flowing back to the heart. In pulmonary valve stenosis this opening is too narrow, leading to a reduction of flow of blood to the lungs.
While the most common cause of pulmonary valve stenosis is congenital heart disease, it may also be due to a malignant carcinoid tumor. Both stenosis of the pulmonary artery and pulmonary valve stenosis are forms of pulmonic stenosis (nonvalvular and valvular, respectively) but pulmonary valve stenosis accounts for 80% of pulmonic stenosis."
Primary Adrenal Insufficiency,"Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, memory decline, forgetfulness, depression, mental disorientation, decreased libido, loss of axillary and pubic hair, amenorrhea, and fatigue","Adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce adequate amounts of steroid hormones. The adrenal glandsalso referred to as the adrenal cortexnormally secrete glucocorticoids (primarily cortisol), mineralocorticoids (primarily aldosterone), and androgens. These hormones are important in regulating blood pressure, electrolytes, and metabolism as a whole. Deficiency of these hormones leads to symptoms ranging from abdominal pain, vomiting, muscle weakness and fatigue, low blood pressure, depression, mood and personality changes (in mild cases) to organ failure and shock (in severe cases). Adrenal crisis may occur if a person having adrenal insufficiency experiences stresses, such as an accident, injury, surgery, or severe infection; this is a life-threatening medical condition resulting from severe deficiency of cortisol in the body."
Cerebral Arteriosclerosis,"Headache, dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, hand tremors, limb numbness, poor sleep, and memory decline","Arteriosclerosis, literally meaning ""hardening of the arteries"", is an umbrella term for a vascular disorder characterized by abnormal thickening, hardening, and loss of elasticity of the walls of arteries; this process gradually restricts the blood flow to one's organs and tissues and can lead to severe health risks brought on by atherosclerosis, which is a specific form of arteriosclerosis caused by the buildup of fatty plaques, cholesterol, and some other substances in and on the artery walls (it can be brought on by smoking, a bad diet, or many genetic factors).
Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of coronary artery disease (CAD) and stroke, with multiple genetic and environmental contributions. Genetic-epidemiologic studies have identified a long list of genetic and non-genetic risk factors for CAD. However, such studies indicate that family history is the most significant independent risk factor.


== Signs and symptoms ==
The signs and symptoms of arteriosclerosis depend on the vessel affected by the disease. If affecting cerebral or ophthalmic vessels, as in cerebrovascular accidents or transient ischemic attacks, signs and symptoms may include sudden weakness, facial or lower limb numbness, confusion, difficulty understanding speech, and problems seeing."
Malignant Histiocytosis,"High fever, anemia, infections, bleeding, weight loss, loss of appetite, jaundice, abdominal pain, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy","Malignant histiocytosis  is a rare hereditary disease found in the Bernese Mountain Dog and humans, characterized by histiocytic infiltration of the lungs and lymph nodes.  The liver, spleen, and central nervous system can also be affected.  Histiocytes are a component of the immune system that proliferate abnormally in this disease.  In addition to its importance in veterinary medicine, the condition is also important in human pathology.


== Histiocytic disorders ==
A histiocyte is a differentiated tissue cell that has its origin in the bone marrow."
Skin Metastases from Lung Cancer,"Unexplained skin nodules, pain, ulceration","Bone metastasis, or osseous metastatic disease, is a category of cancer metastases that result from primary tumor invasions into bones. Bone-originating primary tumors such as osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma are rare; the most common bone tumor is a metastasis. Bone metastases can be classified as osteolytic, osteoblastic, or both. Unlike hematologic malignancies which originate in the blood and form non-solid tumors, bone metastases generally arise from epithelial tumors and form a solid mass inside the bone. Primary breast cancer patients are particularly vulnerable to develop bone metastases."
Immunodeficiency Pneumonia,"Vascular edema, facial deformity, nystagmus, thrombocytopenia, eczema, telangiectasia, photophobia","The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) are two species of Lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that infect humans. Over time, they cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a condition in which progressive failure of the immune system allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype.
In most cases, HIV is a sexually transmitted infection and occurs by contact with or transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, and vaginal fluids. Non-sexual transmission can occur from an infected mother to her infant during pregnancy, during childbirth by exposure to her blood or vaginal fluid, and through breast milk."
Melanocytic Nevus,"Black spots, itching, swelling and pain","A melanocytic nevus (also known as nevocytic nevus, nevus-cell nevus, and commonly as a mole) is usually a noncancerous condition of pigment-producing skin cells. It is a type of melanocytic tumor that contains nevus cells. A mole can be either subdermal (under the skin) or a pigmented growth on the skin, formed mostly of a type of cell known as a melanocyte. The high concentration of the body's pigmenting agent, melanin, is responsible for their dark color. Moles are a member of the family of skin lesions known as nevi (singular ""nevus""), occurring commonly in humans."
Primary Ovarian Choriocarcinoma,"Abdominal pain, abdominal mass, vaginal bleeding, fever, barrel-shaped nails, severe unilateral lower abdominal pain, polycystic ovaries, pelvic heaviness, pelvic mass","Choriocarcinoma is a trophoblastic cancer usually located on the placenta. It is characterized by early hematogenous spread to the lungs. It belongs to the malignant end of the spectrum in gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). It is also classified as a germ cell tumor and may arise in the testis or ovary.


== Signs and symptoms ==
increased quantitative chorionic gonadotropin (the ""pregnancy hormone"") levels
vaginal bleeding
shortness of breath
hemoptysis (coughing up blood)
chest pain
chest X-ray shows multiple infiltrates of various shapes in both lungs
presents in males as a testicular cancer, sometimes with skin hyperpigmentation (from excess chorionic gonadotropin cross-reacting with the alpha MSH receptor), gynecomastia, and weight loss (from excess chorionic gonadotropin cross-reacting with the LH, FSH, and TSH receptor) in males
can present with decreased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) due to hyperthyroidism."
Malignant Salivary Gland Tumor,Painless salivary gland mass,"Salivary gland tumours, or neoplasms, are tumours that form in the tissues of salivary glands. The salivary glands are classified as major or minor. The major salivary glands consist of the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. The minor salivary glands consist of 800 to 1000 small mucus-secreting glands located throughout the lining of the oral cavity. People with these types of tumours may be asymptomatic."
Mucinous Ovarian Tumor,"Lower abdominal mass, pain, and menstrual irregularity","Mucinous tumors are a type of ovarian tumor. They are typically large.
They are part of the surface epithelial-stromal tumor group of ovarian neoplasms, and account for approximately 36% of all ovarian tumors.
Approximately 75% are benign, 10% are borderline and 15% are malignant.
Rarely, the tumor is seen bilaterally; approximately 5% of primary mucinous tumors are bilateral."
Gastric Diaphragm,"Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, gastric duplication anomaly, abdominal distension","Gastric dilatation volvulus (GDV), also known as gastric dilation, twisted stomach, or gastric torsion, is a medical condition that affects dogs and rarely cats and guinea pigs, in which the stomach becomes overstretched and rotated by excessive gas content. The condition also involves compression of the  diaphragm and caudal vena cavae. The word bloat is often used as a general term to mean gas distension without stomach torsion (a normal change after eating), or to refer to GDV.
GDV is a life-threatening condition in dogs that requires prompt treatment. It is common in certain breeds; deep-chested and large dog breeds are especially at risk. Mortality rates in dogs range from 10 to 60%, even with treatment."
Familial Non-Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma,"Difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing, hoarseness, thyroid enlargement, thyroid nodules","Multiple endocrine neoplasia (abbreviated MEN) is a condition which encompasses several distinct syndromes featuring tumors of endocrine glands, each with its own characteristic pattern.  In some cases, the tumors are malignant, in others, benign. Benign or malignant tumors of nonendocrine tissues occur as components of some of these tumor syndromes.
MEN syndromes are inherited as autosomal dominant disorders.


== Presentation ==


=== Related conditions ===
Although not officially categorized as multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes, Von HippelLindau disease and Carney complex are two other autosomal dominant endocrine tumor syndromes with features that overlap the clinical features of the MEN syndromes."
Heart Failure,"Orthopnea, tachycardia, restlessness, pink frothy sputum, syncope, chest pain with tightness, palpitations, pitting edema in both lower limbs","Heart failure (HF), also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), is a syndrome caused by an impairment in the heart's ability to fill with and pump blood.
Although symptoms vary based on which side of the heart is affected, HF typically presents with shortness of breath, excessive fatigue, and bilateral leg swelling. The severity of the heart failure is mainly decided based on ejection fraction and also measured by the severity of symptoms. Other conditions that have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver disease, anemia, and thyroid disease.
Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excessive alcohol consumption, infection, and cardiomyopathy."
Papillary adenoma,"Dehydration, incomplete bowel evacuation, mucous discharge, feeling of incomplete defecation, circulatory failure, acidosis","Aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma, also known as digital papillary adenocarcinoma and papillary adenoma is a cutaneous condition characterized by an aggressive malignancy involving the digit between the nailbed and the distal interphalangeal  joint spaces.:670 Genetic studies reveal that human papilloma virus HPV42 is the likely driving virus in this cancer.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Aggressive digital papillary adenocarcinoma typically appears as a painless solitary mass on the plantar surface of the feet or palmer surface of the hands.


== Diagnosis ==
Histologically, the tumor exhibits a mixed tubuloalveolar and papillary pattern, focal squamous metaplasia, fibrocollagenous stroma, and a grenz zone. In situ hybridization for HPV42 DNA may help in differentiating this cancer from related tumors. 
The sweat gland adenoid cystic carcinoma, mucinous eccrine carcinoma, and apocrine adenocarcinoma are included in the differential diagnosis."
Drug-induced Glaucoma,"Unequal pupil size, juvenile cataract, abnormal pupil, cherry-red spot at the fundus, deformed pupil, eye pain, elevated intraocular pressure, foreign body sensation in the eye, narrowed visual field, increased eye pressure, sectoral iris atrophy, ulceration","Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can lead to damage of the optic nerve. The optic nerve transmits visual information from the eye to the brain. Glaucoma may cause vision loss if left untreated. It has been called the ""silent thief of sight"" because the loss of vision usually occurs slowly over a long period of time. A major risk factor for glaucoma is increased pressure within the eye, known as intraocular pressure (IOP)."
Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS),"Pallor, fatigue, palpitations after activity, shortness of breath, anemia in the elderly often exacerbates pre-existing chronic heart and lung diseases, fever","A myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is one of a group of cancers in which blood cells in the bone marrow do not mature, and as a result, do not develop into healthy blood cells. Early on, no symptoms typically are seen. Later, symptoms may include fatigue, shortness of breath, bleeding disorders, anemia, or frequent infections. Some types may develop into acute myeloid leukemia.
Risk factors include previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy, exposure to certain chemicals such as tobacco smoke, pesticides, and benzene, and exposure to heavy metals such as mercury or lead."
Epileptic Psychosis,"Persecutory delusion, derealization, unsteady gait, dementia, convulsions, sudden falls, neurosis with concurrent epilepsy, personality changes due to epilepsy","Anna Elisabeth ""Anneliese"" Michel (21 September 1952  1 July 1976) was a German woman who underwent 67 Catholic exorcism rites during the year before her death. She died of malnutrition, for which her parents and priest were convicted of negligent homicide. She was diagnosed with epileptic psychosis (temporal lobe epilepsy) and had a history of psychiatric treatment that proved ineffective.
When Michel was 16, she experienced a seizure and was diagnosed with psychosis caused by temporal lobe epilepsy. Shortly thereafter, she was diagnosed with depression and was treated by a psychiatric hospital."
Solar Lentigines,"Itching, pain, burning sensation","Liver spots (also known as age spot, solar lentigo, ""lentigo senilis"",:686 ""old age spot"", ""senile freckle"") are blemishes on the skin associated with aging and exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun. They range in color from light brown to red or black and are located in areas most often exposed to the sun, particularly the hands, face, shoulders, arms and forehead, and the scalp if bald.
The spots derive their name from the fact that they were once incorrectly believed to be caused by liver problems, but they are physiologically unrelated to the liver, save for a similar color. From the age of 40, the skin is less able to regenerate from sun exposure, and liver spots are very common in this age group, particularly in those who spend time in the sun.
In the overwhelming majority of cases, liver spots pose no threat and require no treatment, though they occasionally have been known to obscure the detection of skin cancer."
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning,"Headache, weakness, dizziness, cherry red color of lips with possible nausea, vomiting, confusion, collapse or coma, accompanied by high fever, increased muscle tone in the limbs, and episodic or tonic-clonic seizures","Carbon monoxide poisoning typically occurs from breathing in carbon monoxide (CO) at excessive levels. Symptoms are often described as ""flu-like"" and commonly include headache, dizziness, weakness, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. Large exposures can result in loss of consciousness, arrhythmias, seizures, or death. The classically described ""cherry red skin"" rarely occurs. Long-term complications may include chronic fatigue, trouble with memory, and movement problems."
Microscopic Polyangiitis,"Skin purpura, papules, livedo reticularis, hematuria with proteinuria, fever with arthralgia, heart failure, maculopapular rash, vasculitis, hypersensitivity angiitis, arrhythmias, systemic vasculitis","Microscopic polyangiitis is an autoimmune disease characterized by a systemic, pauci-immune, necrotizing, small-vessel vasculitis without clinical or pathological evidence of granulomatous inflammation.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Clinical features may include constitutional symptoms like fever, arthralgia, myalgia, loss of appetite, weight loss and fatigue. A variety of organs can be affected, which causes a wide range of symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis (coughing up of blood), symptoms of kidney failure, skin manifestations (palpable purpura and livedo racemosa), seizures or peripheral neuropathy, abdominal pain 
The kidneys are affected in up to 80% of cases with signs of blood and protein in the urine and the injury can lead to either rapidly or slowly progressive kidney failure. The lungs are affected in 20-50% of cases with findings of pulmonary hemorrhage, or chronic pulmonary fibrosis leading to respiratory failure.


== Causes ==
While the mechanism of the disease has yet to be fully elucidated, the leading hypothesis is that AAV (ANCA Associated Vasculitis) develops in patients with a genetic predisposition when an unknown cause triggers the production of p-ANCA. These antibodies will circulate at low levels until an environmental triggersuch as infection, malignancy, or drug therapy, causes the upregulation of neutrophils."
Crohn's Disease,"Nausea, vomiting, intermittent spasmodic abdominal pain, purulent bloody stool, tenesmus, progressive weight loss","Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, abdominal distension, and weight loss. Complications outside of the gastrointestinal tract may include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and fatigue. The skin rashes may be due to infections, as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction may occur as a complication of chronic inflammation, and those with the disease are at greater risk of colon cancer and small bowel cancer."
Prion Diseases,"Ataxia, dementia, insomnia, paraplegia, myoclonus, seizures, memory impairment, paralysis","Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), also known as prion diseases, are a group of progressive, incurable, and fatal conditions that are associated with the prion hypothesis and affect the brain and nervous system of many animals, including humans, cattle, and sheep. According to the most widespread hypothesis, they are transmitted by prions, though some other data suggest an involvement of a Spiroplasma infection. Mental and physical abilities deteriorate and many tiny holes appear in the cortex causing it to appear like a sponge when brain tissue obtained at autopsy is examined under a microscope. The disorders cause impairment of brain function which may result in memory loss, personality changes, and abnormal or impaired movement which worsen over time.
TSEs of humans include CreutzfeldtJakob disease, GerstmannStrusslerScheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia, and kuru, as well as the recently discovered variably protease-sensitive prionopathy and familial spongiform encephalopathy."
Acute Renal Failure in the Elderly,"Azotemia, mixed acid-base imbalance, reduced appetite, nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension, diarrhea, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, heart failure, arrhythmias, drowsiness, and disturbances in consciousness","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a type of long-term kidney disease, defined by the sustained presence of abnormal kidney function and/or abnormal kidney structure. To meet criteria for CKD, the abnormalities must be present for at least three months. Early in the course of CKD, patients are usually asymptomatic, but later symptoms may include leg swelling, feeling tired, vomiting, loss of appetite, and confusion. Complications can relate to hormonal dysfunction of the kidneys and include (in chronological order) high blood pressure (often related to activation of the reninangiotensin system), bone disease, and anemia. Additionally CKD patients have markedly increased cardiovascular complications with increased risks of death and hospitalization."
Esophageal Cancer,"Sense of choking when swallowing, burning behind the sternum, pinprick sensation, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss","Esophageal cancer (American English) or oesophageal cancer (British English) is cancer arising from the esophagusthe food pipe that runs between the throat and the stomach. Symptoms often include difficulty in swallowing and weight loss. Other symptoms may include pain when swallowing, a hoarse voice, enlarged lymph nodes (""glands"") around the collarbone, a dry cough, and possibly coughing up or vomiting blood.
The two main sub-types of the disease are esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (often abbreviated to ESCC), which is more common in the developing world, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which is more common in the developed world. A number of less common types also occur."
Aortic Dissection in the Elderly,"Chest pain, shock, syncope, clouding of consciousness, dyspnea, hoarseness, dizziness, confusion, widened pulse pressure, water-hammer pulse, cardiac murmurs, and blood in stools","Aortic dissection (AD) occurs when an injury to the innermost layer of the aorta allows blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall, forcing the layers apart. In most cases, this is associated with a sudden onset of agonizing chest or back pain, often described as ""tearing"" in character. Vomiting, sweating, and lightheadedness may also occur. Damage to other organs may result from the decreased blood supply, such as stroke, lower extremity ischemia, or mesenteric ischemia. Aortic dissection can quickly lead to death from insufficient blood flow to the heart or complete rupture of the aorta."
Intraocular Lesions,"Blurred vision, distortion, pain","SturgeWeber syndrome, sometimes referred to as encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis, is a rare congenital neurocutaneous disorder (also known as phakomatoses). It is often associated with port-wine stains of the face, glaucoma, seizures, intellectual disability, and ipsilateral leptomeningeal angioma (cerebral malformations and tumors). SturgeWeber syndrome can be classified into three different types. Type 1 includes facial and leptomeningeal angiomas as well as the possibility of glaucoma or choroidal lesions. Normally, only one side of the brain is affected."
Hepatocellular Carcinoma Intervention,"Pain in the liver area, jaundice, constipation, abdominal distension","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer in adults and is currently the most common cause of death in people with cirrhosis. HCC is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.
HCC most commonly occurs in those with chronic liver disease especially those with cirrhosis or fibrosis, which occur in the setting of chronic liver injury and inflammation. HCC is rare in those without chronic liver disease. Chronic liver diseases which greatly increase the risk of HCC include hepatitis infection such as (hepatitis B, C or D), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), alcoholic liver disease, or exposure to toxins such as aflatoxin, or pyrrolizidine alkaloids.:870873 Certain diseases, such as hemochromatosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, markedly increase the risk of developing HCC. The five-year survival in those with HCC is 18%."

Listed below are conditions that constitute a possible medical emergency and may require immediate first aid, emergency room care, surgery, or care by a physician or nurse. Not all medical emergencies are life-threatening; some conditions require medical attention in order to prevent significant and long-lasting effects on physical or mental health."
Blood Stasis,"Pain, ecchymosis, cyanosis","Blood stasis (also blood stagnation and blood stasis syndrome) (BS) is a concept in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), described as a slowing or pooling of the blood due to a disruption of heart qi. Blood stasis is also described by practitioners of TCM in terms of yin deficiency, qi deficiency and qi stagnation. For non-practitioners of TCM it is sometimes explained in terms of hematological disorders such as hemorrhage, congestion, thrombosis or local ischemia, and in terms of tissue changes. TCM practitioners believe it is an important underlying pathology of many disease processes despite the fact that objective, consistent methods for measuring the presence of blood stasis syndrome are not readily available. Blood stasis is associated with justifications for acupuncture and herbal treatments."
Atrial Flutter and Atrial Fibrillation,"Arrhythmia, palpitations, shortness of breath, abnormal heart sounds","Atrial fibrillation (AF, AFib or A-fib) is an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) characterized by rapid and irregular beating of the atrial chambers of the heart. It often begins as short periods of abnormal beating, which become longer or continuous over time.  It may also start as other forms of arrhythmia such as atrial flutter that then transform into AF.
Episodes can be asymptomatic. Symptomatic episodes may involve heart palpitations, fainting, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, or shortness of breath. Atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, dementia, and stroke."
Orbital Leiomyoma,"Blurred vision, visual impairment, exophthalmos","The following is a list of cancer types. Cancer is a group of diseases that involve abnormal increases in the number of cells, with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors or lumps are cancerous; benign tumors are not classified as being cancer because they do not spread to other parts of the body. There are over 100 different known cancers that affect humans.
Cancers are often described by the body part that they originated in."
Spinal Cord Cavernous Hemangioma,"Autonomic dysfunction, spinal hemorrhage, spinal cord lesions","Cavernous hemangioma, also called cavernous angioma, venous malformation, or cavernoma, is a type of venous malformation due to endothelial dysmorphogenesis from a lesion which is present at birth. A cavernoma in the brain is called a cerebral cavernous malformation or CCM.  Despite its designation as a hemangioma, a cavernous hemangioma is a benign (but not harmless) condition, not a malignant tumor, as it does not display endothelial hyperplasia. The abnormal tissue causes a slowing of blood flow through the cavities, or ""caverns"". The blood vessels do not form the necessary junctions with surrounding cells, and the structural support from the smooth muscle is hindered, causing leakage into the surrounding tissue. It is the leakage of blood (hemorrhage) that causes a variety of symptoms known to be associated with the condition."
Diffuse Infantile Fibromatosis,Calcification,"Diffuse infantile fibromatosis is a rare condition affecting infants during the first three years of life. This condition is a multicentric infiltration of muscle fibers with fibroblasts resembling those seen in aponeurotic fibromas, presenting as lesions and tumors confined usually to the muscles of the arms, neck, and shoulder area:607 Diffuse infantile fibromatosis is characterized by fast growing benign tumors. This disorder is known to be caused by mutations in germline variants, PDGFRB and NOTCH3, which may be generationally-inherited through autosomal dominant and recessive traits. Although diffuse infantile fibromatosis is classified as benign, it can still lead to life-threatening complications and damage other organs.


== Classification ==
Fibromatoses as are recurring non-metastasizing tumor growths."
Primary Cutaneous Immunocytoma,"Lymph node enlargement, nodules, splenomegaly","Primary cutaneous immunocytoma was initially regarded as a distinct type of the cutaneous lymphomas of the skin. (The ""primary"" used to designate cutaneous lymphomas indicates that the lymphoma was first diagnosed as limited to the skin and there was no evidence of spread to extracutaneous tissues for 6 months after the diagnosis was first made.) A 1997 review characterized 16 cases of primary cutaneious immunocytomo as skin lesions located on the arms and legs that in 15 of 16 cases had an excellent responses to, and prognoses after, purely local treatments. On microscopic histological examination, these lesions consisted of B cells (a type of lymphocyte) and nodular or diffuse infiltrates of lymphoplasmacytoid-like plasma cells located at the periphery of these infiltrates. In 2004, however, the World Health Organization (i.e., WHO) and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (i.e., EORTC) classified primary cutaneous immunocytoma as one form of the primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphomas or, as they are now termed, primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoproliferative disorders."
Binswanger's Disease,"Intellectual disabilities, speech disorders, weakness in both lower limbs accompanied by tremors in both hands","Binswanger's disease, also known as subcortical leukoencephalopathy and subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy, is a form of small-vessel vascular dementia caused by damage to the white brain matter. White matter atrophy can be caused by many circumstances including chronic hypertension as well as old age. This disease is characterized by loss of memory and intellectual function and by changes in mood. These changes encompass what are known as executive functions of the brain. It usually presents between 54 and 66 years of age,  and the first symptoms are usually mental deterioration or stroke."
Pulmonary Schistosomiasis,"Fever, cough, expectoration, hemoptysis, chest pain, asthma, difficulty breathing","Schistosomiasis, also known as snail fever, bilharzia, and Katayama fever is a disease caused by parasitic flatworms called schistosomes. It affects the urinary tract or the intestines. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, or blood in the urine. Those who have been infected for a long time may experience liver damage, kidney failure, infertility, or bladder cancer. In children, schistosomiasis may cause poor growth and learning difficulties."
Pulmonary Hyalohyphomycosis,"Cough, expectoration, fatigue, chest tightness, itching, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, blood streak in sputum, fever, difficulty breathing, moist rales","Aspergillosis is a fungal infection of usually the lungs, caused by the genus Aspergillus, a common mold that is breathed in frequently from the air, but does not usually affect most people. It generally occurs in people with lung diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis or tuberculosis, or those who are immunocompromised such as those who have had a stem cell or organ transplant or those who take medications such as steroids and some cancer treatments which suppress the immune system. Rarely, it can affect skin.
Aspergillosis occurs in humans, birds and other animals. Aspergillosis occurs in chronic or acute forms which are clinically very distinct."
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex in Children,"Facial angiofibromas, epilepsy, intellectual disability","Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare multisystem autosomal dominant genetic disease that causes non-cancerous tumours to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, liver, eyes, lungs and skin. A combination of symptoms may include seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delay, behavioral problems, skin abnormalities, lung disease, and kidney disease.
TSC is caused by a mutation of either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which code for the proteins hamartin and tuberin, respectively, with TSC2 mutations accounting for the majority and tending to cause more severe symptoms. These proteins act as tumor growth suppressors, agents that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation.
Prognosis is highly variable and depends on the symptoms, but life expectancy is normal for many."
Hypokalemia in the Elderly,"fatigue, difficulty breathing, palpitations, heart tiredness","Human nutrition deals with the provision of essential nutrients in food that are necessary to support human life and good health. Poor nutrition is a chronic problem often linked to poverty, food security, or a poor understanding of nutritional requirements. Malnutrition and its consequences are large contributors to deaths, physical deformities, and disabilities worldwide. Good nutrition is necessary for children to grow physically and mentally, and for normal human biological development.


== Recommended Dietary Allowances ==
The Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are scientifically determined levels of essential nutrient intake, deemed sufficient by the Food and Nutrition Board to meet the nutritional needs of nearly all healthy individuals."
Verrucous Carcinoma,"Nail in tube shape, squamous cell carcinoma, ulcer appears cauliflower-like, condyloma acuminatum","Verrucous carcinoma (VC) is an uncommon variant of squamous cell carcinoma.

Nasopharyngeal Sarcoma,"Nasal obstruction, Eustachian tube blockage","Evofosfamide, formerly known as TH-302 is an investigational new drug that is being evaluated for the treatment of multiple tumor types, including pancreatic cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, and multiple myeloma, often in combination with other therapies. It is a hypoxia-activated prodrug designed to target and kill hypoxic cells within tumors. It functions by releasing the DNA crosslinking agent bromo-isophosphoramide mustard under low oxygen conditions, making it potentially effective against tumor regions where standard chemotherapy and radiation therapies are less effective due to hypoxia.
Commercialization has not been pursued due to the failure of several clinical trials.


== Pharmacology ==
Evofosfamide is a 2-nitroimidazole prodrug of the cytotoxin bromo-isophosphoramide mustard (Br-IPM)."
Appendicitis Complicating Pregnancy,"Abdominal pain, fever, tenderness in the lower right abdomen, vomiting","Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is a rare life-threatening complication of pregnancy that occurs in the third trimester or the immediate period after delivery.  It is thought to be caused by a disordered metabolism of fatty acids by mitochondria in the fetus, caused by long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency. This leads to decreased metabolism of long-chain fatty acids by the fetoplacental unit, causing a subsequent rise in hepatotoxic fatty acids in maternal plasma. The condition was previously thought to be universally fatal, but aggressive treatment by stabilizing the mother with intravenous fluids and blood products in anticipation of early delivery has improved prognosis.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (or hepatic lipidosis of pregnancy) usually manifests in the third trimester of pregnancy, but may occur any time in the second half of pregnancy, or the puerperium, the period immediately after delivery."
Primary Splenic Lymphoma,"Upper left abdominal pain, abdominal mass, anemia, vomiting, weight loss","The large-cell lymphomas have large cells. One classification system for lymphomas divides the diseases according to the size of the white blood cells that have turned cancerous. A large cell, in this context, has a diameter of 17 to 20 m.  Other groups of lymphomas in this system are the small-cell lymphomas and mixed-cell lymphomas.

Pediatric Restrictive Cardiomyopathy,"Jugular vein distension, hepatomegaly, ascites, lower extremity edema, cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, chest pain, splenomegaly, diffuse apex beat, cyanosis, electrophysiological abnormalities","Cardiomyopathy is a group of primary diseases of the heart muscle. Early on there may be few or no symptoms. As the disease worsens, shortness of breath, feeling tired, and swelling of the legs may occur, due to the onset of heart failure. An irregular heart beat and fainting may occur. Those affected are at an increased risk of sudden cardiac death."
Chronic Pyelonephritis in the Elderly,"General malaise, weight loss, low-grade fever, urinary incontinence, difficulty in urination, urinary retention, polyuria, nocturia, etc. A minority of patients may present with back pain, dull abdominal pain, or renal colic.","Pyelonephritis  is inflammation of the kidney, typically due to a bacterial infection. Symptoms most often include fever and flank tenderness. Other symptoms may include nausea, burning with urination, and frequent urination. Complications may include pus around the kidney, sepsis, or kidney failure.
It is typically due to a bacterial infection, most commonly Escherichia coli."
Pediatric Autumn Diarrhea,,"Colchicine is a medication used to prevent and treat gout, to treat familial Mediterranean fever and Behet's disease, and to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction. The American College of Rheumatology recommends colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or steroids in the treatment of gout. Other uses for colchicine include the management of pericarditis. 
Colchicine is taken by mouth. The injectable route of administration for colchicine can be toxic."
Mucinous Eccrine Carcinoma,Nodules,"A mucinous neoplasm (also called colloid neoplasm) is an abnormal and excessive growth of tissue (neoplasia) with associated mucin (a fluid that sometimes resembles thyroid colloid). It arises from epithelial cells that line certain internal organs and skin, and produce mucin (the main component of mucus). A malignant mucinous neoplasm is called a mucinous carcinoma. For example, for ovarian mucinous tumors, approximately 75% are benign, 10% are borderline and 15% are malignant.


== Mucinous carcinoma ==
Over 40 percent of all mucinous carcinomas are colorectal."
Clear Cell Chondrosarcoma,"The tumor often appears red or sanguineous, located at the epiphyses or bone protuberance, with clear boundaries and osteolytic areas.","A bone sarcoma is a primary  malignant bone tumour, a type of sarcoma that starts in the bones. This is in contrast to most bone cancers that are  secondary having developed as a metastasis from another cancer. Bone sarcomas are rare, and mostly affect the legs. The other type of sarcoma is a soft-tissue sarcoma.
There are three main types of bone sarcoma based on tissue type  an osteosarcoma, a Ewing's sarcoma, and a chondrosarcoma."
Neurofibromatosis,"Presents with intellectual decline, memory disorders, epileptic seizures, limb weakness, numbness, and skin pigmentation spots, which appear light brown, dark brown, or coffee-colored","Neurofibromatosis (NF) refers to a group of three distinct genetic conditions in which tumors grow in the nervous system. The tumors are non-cancerous (benign) and often involve the skin or surrounding bone. Although symptoms are often mild, each condition presents differently. Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is typically characterized by caf au lait spots (light-brown flat patches of skin), neurofibromas (small bumps in or under the skin), scoliosis (side-way curvature of the back), and headaches. Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2), on the other hand, may present with early-onset hearing loss, cataracts, tinnitus, difficulty walking or maintaining balance, and muscle atrophy."
Burn Shock,"Increased pulse rate, decreased urine output, thirst, nausea, vomiting","An electrical injury (electric injury) or electrical shock (electric shock) is damage sustained to the skin or internal organs on direct contact with an electric current.
The injury depends on the density of the current, tissue resistance and duration of contact. Very small currents may be imperceptible or only produce a light tingling sensation. However, a shock caused by low and otherwise harmless current could startle an individual and cause injury due to jerking away or falling. A strong electric shock can often cause painful muscle spasms severe enough to dislocate joints or even to break bones."
Neonatal Necrotizing Enterocolitis,"Abdominal distension, absence of bowel sounds, diarrhea, lethargy, bloody stools, vomiting, feeding intolerance, shock","Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an intestinal disease that affects premature or very low birth weight infants. Symptoms may include poor feeding, bloating, decreased activity, blood in the stool, vomiting of bile, multi-organ failure, and potentially death.

=== Hard fibroma ===
The hard fibroma (fibroma durum) consists of many fibres and few cells, e.g."
Age Spots,"Pigmentation abnormalities, dark spots on the face, light brown pigmentation spots","Liver spots (also known as age spot, solar lentigo, ""lentigo senilis"",:686 ""old age spot"", ""senile freckle"") are blemishes on the skin associated with aging and exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun. They range in color from light brown to red or black and are located in areas most often exposed to the sun, particularly the hands, face, shoulders, arms and forehead, and the scalp if bald.
The spots derive their name from the fact that they were once incorrectly believed to be caused by liver problems, but they are physiologically unrelated to the liver, save for a similar color. From the age of 40, the skin is less able to regenerate from sun exposure, and liver spots are very common in this age group, particularly in those who spend time in the sun.
In the overwhelming majority of cases, liver spots pose no threat and require no treatment, though they occasionally have been known to obscure the detection of skin cancer."
Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis,"Influenza-like symptoms, headache, vomiting, muscle soreness, nausea and vomiting, body ache, fever, muscle weakness, irregular breathing","Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) is a rodent-borne viral infectious disease that presents as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis or meningoencephalitis. Its causative agent is lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a member of the family Arenaviridae. The name was coined by Charles Armstrong in 1934.
Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) is ""a viral infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord and of the cerebrospinal fluid"". The name is based on the tendency of an individual to have abnormally high levels of lymphocytes during infection."
Meibomian Gland Carcinoma,"Subcutaneous nodules that are hard and not adherent to the skin, resembling chalazion. As they grow larger, yellow nodules can be seen on the conjunctival surface, with an uneven surface, eventually forming ulcers, cauliflower-like tumors that bleed easily upon touch.","Sebaceous carcinoma, also known as sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGc), sebaceous cell carcinoma, and meibomian gland carcinoma, is an uncommon malignant cutaneous (skin) tumor. Most are typically about 1.4 cm at presentation. SGc originates from sebaceous glands in the skin and, therefore, may originate anywhere in the body where these glands are found. SGc can be divided into 2 types: periocular and extraocular. The periocular region is rich in sebaceous glands making it a common site of origin."
Osteomyelitis of the Jaw,"Weight loss, numbness of the lower lip, facial pain, toothache, radiating pain, facial swelling, gum swelling, tooth mobility and loss, difficulty in opening the mouth, difficulty in opening the eyes, sequestrum, purulent discharge from the gums","Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a severe bone disease (osteonecrosis) that affects the jaws (the maxilla and the mandible). Various forms of ONJ have been described since 1861, and a number of causes have been suggested in the literature.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw associated with bisphosphonate therapy, which is required by some cancer treatment regimens, has been identified and defined as a pathological entity (bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw) since 2003. The possible risk from lower oral doses of bisphosphonates, taken by patients to prevent or treat osteoporosis, remains uncertain.
Treatment options have been explored; however, severe cases of ONJ still require surgical removal of the affected bone."
Hereditary Fructose Intolerance in Children,"Cold sweats, tendency to bleed, hypoglycemia, ascites, abdominal pain, diarrhea, liver failure, jaundice","Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is an inborn error of fructose metabolism caused by a deficiency of the enzyme aldolase B. Individuals affected with HFI are asymptomatic until they ingest fructose, sucrose, or sorbitol. If fructose is ingested, the enzymatic block at aldolase B causes an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate which, over time, results in the death of liver cells. This accumulation has downstream effects on gluconeogenesis and regeneration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Symptoms of HFI include vomiting, convulsions, irritability, poor feeding as a baby, hypoglycemia, jaundice, hemorrhage, hepatomegaly, hyperuricemia and potentially kidney failure. There are reported deaths in infants and children as a result of the metabolic consequences of HFI. Death in HFI is always associated with problems in diagnosis."
Gallbladder Carcinoma,"Abnormal appetite, anorexia, biliary obstruction, jaundice","Gallbladder cancer is a relatively uncommon cancer, with an incidence of fewer than 2 cases per 100,000 people per year in the United States. It is particularly common in central and South America, central and eastern Europe, Japan and northern India; it is also common in certain ethnic groups e.g. Native American Indians and Hispanics. If it is diagnosed early enough, it can be cured by removing the gallbladder, part of the liver and associated lymph nodes. Most often it is found after symptoms such as abdominal pain, jaundice and vomiting occur, and it has spread to other organs such as the liver."
Oral Ulcer,"Localized ulcer burning pain, oral vesicles, halitosis, lymphadenopathy","A mouth ulcer (aphtha), or sometimes called a canker sore or salt blister, is an ulcer that occurs on the mucous membrane of the oral cavity. Mouth ulcers are very common, occurring in association with many diseases and by many different mechanisms, but usually there is no serious underlying cause. Rarely, a mouth ulcer that does not heal may be a sign of oral cancer. These ulcers may form individually or multiple ulcers may appear at once (i.e., a ""crop"" of ulcers). Once formed, an ulcer may be maintained by inflammation and/or secondary infection."
Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome,"Arrhythmia, Tachycardia","WolffParkinsonWhite syndrome (WPWS) is a disorder due to a specific type of problem with the electrical system of the heart involving an accessory pathway able to conduct electrical current between the atria and the ventricles, thus bypassing the atrioventricular node. About 60% of people with the electrical problem develop symptoms, which may include an abnormally fast heartbeat, palpitations, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or syncope. Rarely, cardiac arrest may occur. The most common type of irregular heartbeat that occurs is known as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
The cause of WPW is typically unknown and is likely due to a combination of chance and genetic factors."
Pulmonary and Pleural Amebiasis,"Diarrhea, fever, loss of appetite, hemoptysis, weight loss, cough, pneumothorax, shock, fatigue, coughing up chocolate-colored sputum, difficulty breathing, chest pain","Amoebiasis, or amoebic dysentery, is an infection of the intestines caused by a parasitic amoeba Entamoeba histolytica. Amoebiasis can be present with no, mild, or severe symptoms. Symptoms may include lethargy, loss of weight, colonic ulcerations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or bloody diarrhea. Complications can include inflammation and ulceration of the colon with tissue death or perforation, which may result in peritonitis. Anemia may develop due to prolonged gastric bleeding."
Gastric Lipoma,"Upper abdominal bloating and discomfort, pain, intermittent vomiting, hematemesis, and melena","A polyp is an abnormal growth of tissue projecting from a mucous membrane. If it is attached to the surface by a narrow elongated stalk, it is said to be pedunculated; if it is attached without a stalk, it is said to be sessile. 
Polyps are commonly found in the colon, stomach, nose, ear, sinus(es), urinary bladder, and uterus. They may also occur elsewhere in the body where there are mucous membranes, including the cervix, vocal folds, and small intestine. Some polyps are tumors (neoplasms) and others are non-neoplastic, for example hyperplastic or dysplastic, which are benign."
Ischemic Cardiomyopathy,"Angina, chest tightness, exertional dyspnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fatigue, loss of appetite, jugular venous distention, and jugular venous pulsation","Ischemic cardiomyopathy is a type of cardiomyopathy caused by a narrowing of the coronary arteries which supply blood to the heart. Typically, patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy have a history of acute myocardial infarction, however, it may occur in patients with coronary artery disease, but without a past history of acute myocardial infarction. This cardiomyopathy is one of the leading causes of sudden cardiac death. The adjective ischemic means characteristic of, or accompanied by, ischemia  local anemia due to mechanical obstruction of the blood supply.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms of ischemic cardiomyopathy include sudden fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, and palpitations."
Complex Congenital Heart Disease,"Chest tightness, palpitations, panic, shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing","A congenital heart defect (CHD), also known as a congenital heart anomaly, congenital cardiovascular malformation, and congenital heart disease, is a defect in the structure of the heart or great vessels that is present at birth. A congenital heart defect is classed as a cardiovascular disease. Signs and symptoms depend on the specific type of defect. Symptoms can vary from none to life-threatening. When present, symptoms are variable and may include rapid breathing, bluish skin (cyanosis), poor weight gain, and feeling tired."
Intracranial Tumor,"Recurrent headaches, diplopia, abdominal pain, functional headaches, secondary optic atrophy, increased intracranial pressure, cranial hypertension, paralysis.","A brain tumor (sometimes referred more commonly as brain cancer) occurs when a group of cells within the brain turn cancerous and grow out of control, creating a mass. There are two main types of tumors: malignant (cancerous) tumors and benign (non-cancerous) tumors. These can be further classified as primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which most commonly have spread from tumors located outside the brain, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the size of the tumor and the part of the brain that is involved. Where symptoms exist, they may include headaches, seizures, problems with vision, vomiting and mental changes."
Optic Atrophy,"Visual impairment, reduced visual field, concentric narrowing of the visual field, and decline in visual function","Optic neuropathy is damage to the optic nerve from any cause. The optic nerve is a bundle of millions of fibers in the retina that sends visual signals to the brain.
Damage and death of these nerve cells, or neurons, leads to characteristic features of optic neuropathy. The main symptom is loss of vision, with colors appearing subtly washed out in the affected eye. A pale disc is characteristic of long-standing optic neuropathy."
Facial Liposuction,,"Oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) is a surgical specialty focusing on reconstructive surgery of the face, facial trauma surgery, the mouth, head and neck, and jaws, as well as facial plastic surgery including cleft lip and cleft palate surgery.


== Specialty ==

Maxillofacial regeneration, which is re-formation of the facial region by advanced stem cell technique


=== United Kingdom and Europe ===
In countries such as the UK and most of Europe, it is recognised as a specialty of medicine with a degree in medicine and an additional degree in dentistry being compulsory. The scope of practice is mainly head and neck cancer, microvascular reconstruction, craniofacial surgery and cranio-maxillofacial trauma, skin cancer, facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, craniofacial surgery, TMJ surgery and cosmetic facial surgery."
Pediatric Glomerular Disease,"Edema, Hematuria, Oliguria, Hypertension","Hematuria or haematuria is defined as the presence of blood or red blood cells in the urine. ""Gross hematuria"" occurs when urine appears red, brown, or tea-colored due to the presence of blood. Hematuria may also be subtle and only detectable with a microscope or laboratory test. Blood that enters and mixes with the urine can come from any location within the urinary system, including the kidney, ureter, urinary bladder, urethra, and in men, the prostate. Common causes of hematuria include urinary tract infection (UTI), kidney stones, viral illness, trauma, bladder cancer, and exercise."
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma,"Enlarged lymph nodes, superficial lymph node swelling, weight loss, fever, chest tightness, chest pain, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, abdominal mass, anemia, weakness, night sweats","Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), also known as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, is a group of blood cancers that includes all types of lymphomas except Hodgkin lymphomas. Symptoms include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and tiredness. Other symptoms may include bone pain, chest pain, or itchiness. Some forms are slow-growing while others are fast-growing. Unlike Hodgkin lymphoma, which spreads contiguously, NHL is largely a systemic illness."
Cirrhosis in the Elderly,"Spider angiomas, palmar erythema, telangiectasia, jaundice, amenorrhea, decreased libido, testicular atrophy, metabolic disorders of glucose, splenomegaly, ascites, pleural effusion, fatigue","Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue. Some people or animals with hepatitis have no symptoms, whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hepatitis is acute if it resolves within six months, and chronic if it lasts longer than six months. Acute hepatitis can resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or (rarely) result in acute liver failure. Chronic hepatitis may progress to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer."
Pediatric Meningioma,"Seizures, secondary optic atrophy, increased intracranial pressure, hemianopsia, slow growth, headache","A brain tumor (sometimes referred more commonly as brain cancer) occurs when a group of cells within the brain turn cancerous and grow out of control, creating a mass. There are two main types of tumors: malignant (cancerous) tumors and benign (non-cancerous) tumors. These can be further classified as primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which most commonly have spread from tumors located outside the brain, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the size of the tumor and the part of the brain that is involved. Where symptoms exist, they may include headaches, seizures, problems with vision, vomiting and mental changes."
Congenital Aortic Sinus of Valsalva Aneurysm Rupture,"heart failure, rupture of aortic sinus, femoral artery gunshot sound, right heart failure, cardiac malformation, severe pain, chest tightness, dyspnea, pulsus bisferiens, trembling, jugular venous distension, ventricular hypertrophy","Aneurysm of the aortic sinus, also known as the sinus of Valsalva, is a rare abnormality of the aorta, the largest artery in the body.  The aorta normally has three small pouches that sit directly above the aortic valve (the sinuses of Valsalva), and an aneurysm of one of these sinuses is a thin-walled swelling.  Aneurysms may affect the right (6585%), non-coronary (1030%), or rarely the left (< 5%) coronary sinus. These aneurysms may not cause any symptoms but if large can cause shortness of breath, palpitations or blackouts. Aortic sinus aneurysms can burst or rupture into adjacent cardiac chambers, which can lead to heart failure if untreated."
Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,"Nasal congestion, sneezing, coughing, chills","An upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is an illness caused by an acute infection, which involves the upper respiratory tract, including the nose, sinuses, pharynx, larynx or trachea. This commonly includes nasal obstruction, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, sinusitis, otitis media, and the common cold.:28 Most infections are viral in nature, and in other instances, the cause is bacterial. URTIs can also be fungal or helminthic in origin, but these are less common.:443445
In 2015, 17.2 billion cases of URTIs are estimated to have occurred. As of 2016, they caused about 3,000 deaths, down from 4,000 in 1990.


== Signs and symptoms ==

In uncomplicated colds, coughing and nasal discharge may persist for 14 days or more even after other symptoms have resolved."
Syndrome of Artery of Adamkiewicz Ischemia Contributing to Spinal Cord Blood Supply in Cervical Segments,"Sensory disturbances, Paralysis","Spinal cord stroke is a rare type of stroke with compromised blood flow to any region of spinal cord owing to occlusion or bleeding, leading to irreversible neuronal death. It can be classified into two types, ischaemia and haemorrhage, in which the former accounts for 86% of all cases, a pattern similar to cerebral stroke. The disease is either arisen spontaneously from aortic illnesses or postoperatively. It deprives patients of motor function or sensory function, and sometimes both. Infarction usually occurs in regions perfused by anterior spinal artery, which spans the anterior two-thirds of spinal cord."
Dengue Fever,"Fever with chills, headache, back pain, joint pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, bleeding","Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease caused by dengue virus, prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas. Asymptomatic infections are uncommon, mild cases happen frequently; if symptoms appear, they typically begin 3 to 14 days after infection. These may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin itching and skin rash. Recovery generally takes two to seven days. In a small proportion of cases, the disease develops into severe dengue (previously known as dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome) with bleeding, low levels of blood platelets, blood plasma leakage, and dangerously low blood pressure."
Malignant Atrophic Papulosis,"Edema, papules, skin atrophy and hyperpigmentation, ulcers, constipation, leaf-like hypopigmentation patches, hemorrhagic papules, skin induration, cyanosis, wind papules, sensory disturbances, rectal bleeding","Degos disease, also known as Khlmeier-Degos disease or malignant atrophic papulosis, is an extremely rare condition caused by blockage of arteries and veins. Individuals with this condition will develop papules. Those diagnosed with this disease may also develop complications due to impairment of internal organs. The exact underlying mechanism is still unknown, and an effective treatment is still being developed. There are fewer than 50 living patients presently known worldwide, and fewer than 200 reported in medical literature."
Hypoglycemia,"Palpitations, cold sweats, pale complexion, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, visual disturbances, stiffness, coma, seizures, weakness, vertigo, hunger sensation","Hypoglycemia (American English), also spelled hypoglycaemia or hypoglycmia (British English), sometimes called low blood sugar, is a fall in blood sugar to levels below normal, typically below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). Whipple's triad is used to properly identify hypoglycemic episodes. It is defined as blood glucose below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), symptoms associated with hypoglycemia, and resolution of symptoms when blood sugar returns to normal. Hypoglycemia may result in headache, tiredness, clumsiness, trouble talking, confusion, fast heart rate, sweating, shakiness, nervousness, hunger, loss of consciousness, seizures, or death. Symptoms typically come on quickly."
Proliferating Trichilemmal Cyst,"Nodules, medullary proliferation, atypical hyperplasia","A trichilemmal cyst (or pilar cyst) is a common cyst that forms from a hair follicle, most often on the scalp, and is smooth, mobile, and filled with keratin, a protein component found in hair, nails, skin, and horns. Trichilemmal cysts are clinically and histologically distinct from trichilemmal horns, hard tissue that is much rarer and not limited to the scalp. Rarely, these cysts may grow more extensively and form rapidly multiplying trichilemmal tumors, also called proliferating trichilemmal cysts, which are benign, but may grow aggressively at the cyst site. Very rarely, trichilemmal cysts can become cancerous.


== Classification ==
Trichilemmal cysts may be classified as sebaceous cysts, although technically speaking are not sebaceous."
Superficial Tumors,"Skin swelling, pain, fever","Basal-cell carcinoma (BCC), also known as basal-cell cancer, basalioma or rodent ulcer, is the most common type of skin cancer. It often appears as a painless raised area of skin, which may be shiny with small blood vessels running over it. It may also present as a raised area with ulceration. Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it, but it is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death.
Risk factors include exposure to ultraviolet light, having lighter skin, radiation therapy, long-term exposure to arsenic and poor immune-system function."
Whipple's disease,"Joint pain, diarrhea, small intestine distension with gas, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly","Whipple's disease is a rare systemic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Tropheryma whipplei. First described by George Hoyt Whipple in 1907 and commonly considered as a gastrointestinal disorder, Whipple's disease primarily causes malabsorption, but may affect any part of the human body, including the heart, brain, joints, skin, lungs and the eyes. Weight loss, diarrhea, joint pain, and arthritis are common presenting symptoms, but the presentation can be highly variable in certain individuals, and about 15% of patients do not have the standard signs and symptoms.
Whipple's disease is significantly more common in men, with 87% of patients diagnosed being male. When recognized and treated, Whipple's disease can usually be cured with long-term antibiotic therapy, but if the disease is left undiagnosed or untreated, it can ultimately be fatal."
Brain Injury,"Hemorrhage, altered consciousness, pain, visual disturbances","Brain injury (BI) is the destruction or degeneration of brain cells. Brain injuries occur due to a wide range of internal and external factors. In general, brain damage refers to significant, undiscriminating trauma-induced damage.
A common category with the greatest number of injuries is traumatic brain injury (TBI) following physical trauma or head injury from an outside source, and the term acquired brain injury (ABI) is used in appropriate circles to differentiate brain injuries occurring after birth from injury, from a genetic disorder (GBI), or from a congenital disorder (CBI). Primary and secondary brain injuries identify the processes involved, while focal and diffuse brain injury describe the severity and localization."
Postmenopausal Breast Cancer,"A painless, solitary lump in the breast, hard in consistency, with an irregular surface, unclear boundaries with surrounding tissues, and nipple discharge","Anastrozole, sold under the brand name Arimidex among others, is an antiestrogenic medication used in addition to other treatments for breast cancer. Specifically it is used for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. It has also been used to prevent breast cancer in those at high risk. It is taken orally.
Common side effects of anastrozole include hot flashes, altered mood, joint pain, and nausea."
Pilomatricoma,"Single, isolated nodule","Pilomatricoma is a benign skin tumor derived from the hair matrix. These neoplasms are relatively uncommon and typically occur on the scalp, face, and upper extremities. Clinically, pilomatricomas present as a subcutaneous nodule or cyst with unremarkable overlying epidermis that can range in size from 0.5 to 3.0 cm, but the largest reported case was 24 cm.


== Presentation ==


=== Associations ===
Pilomatricomas have been observed in a variety of genetic disorders including Turner syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, RubinsteinTaybi syndrome, trisomy 9, and Gardner syndrome. It has been reported that the prevalence of pilomatricomas in Turner syndrome is 2.6%."
Bladder Leukoplakia,"Fever, frequent urination accompanied by urgency and pain, hematuria, difficulty in urination","Oral leukoplakia is a potentially malignant disorder affecting the oral mucosa. It is defined as ""essentially an oral mucosal white/gray lesion that cannot be considered as any other definable lesion."" Oral leukoplakia is a gray patch or plaque that develops in the oral cavity and is strongly associated with smoking. Leukoplakia is a firmly attached white patch on a mucous membrane which is associated with increased risk of cancer. The edges of the lesion are typically abrupt and the lesion changes with time. Advanced forms may develop red patches."
Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis with Intracranial Hypertension,"Exophthalmos, red tympanic membrane and retroauricular swelling, headache, vomiting, delirium, convulsions, strabismus, hemiplegia","Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis or cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), is the presence of a blood clot in the dural venous sinuses (which drain blood from the brain), the cerebral veins, or both. Symptoms may include severe headache, visual symptoms, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs on one side of the body, and seizures, which occur in around 40% of patients.
The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses. After confirmation of the diagnosis, investigations may be performed to determine the underlying cause, especially if one is not readily apparent.
Treatment is typically with anticoagulants (medications that suppress blood clotting) such as low molecular weight heparin."
Scleredema Adultorum,"Firm, non-depressed skin hardening, skin sclerosis, difficulty swallowing, arrhythmias","Scleredema is a rare, self-limiting skin condition defined by progressive thickening and hardening of the skin, usually on the areas of the upper back, neck, shoulders and face. The skin may also change color to red or orange. The disease was discovered by Abraham Buschke. Although the cause of scleredema is unknown, it is usually associated with a disease, usually diabetes, a viral illness or strep throat. It is usually not fatal, but it may cause death if the disease spreads to the internal organs."
Traumatic shock,"Coma, apathetic expression, clouded consciousness, tachycardia, pallor, cold sweat, apathy, and rapid breathing","Shock is the state of insufficient blood flow to the tissues of the body as a result of problems with the circulatory system. Initial symptoms of shock may include weakness, tachycardia, hyperventilation, sweating, anxiety, and increased thirst. This may be followed by confusion, unconsciousness, or cardiac arrest, as complications worsen.
Shock is divided into four main types based on the underlying cause: hypovolemic, cardiogenic, obstructive, and distributive shock. Hypovolemic shock, also known as low volume shock, may be from bleeding, diarrhea, or vomiting."
Osteolytic Hemangioendothelioma,"Localized dull pain, tenderness, swelling, neurological symptoms, and paralysis","Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is a non-cancerous bone tumor composed of multiple varying sizes of spaces in a bone which are filled with blood. The term is a misnomer, as the lesion is neither an aneurysm nor a cyst. It generally presents with pain and swelling in the affected bone. Pressure on neighbouring tissues may cause compression effects such as neurological symptoms.
The cause is unknown."
Intestinal Amoebiasis,"Abdominal discomfort, thin stools, diarrhea several times a day accompanied by tenesmus, stools slightly containing pus and blood, occasional constipation","Amoebiasis, or amoebic dysentery, is an infection of the intestines caused by a parasitic amoeba Entamoeba histolytica. Amoebiasis can be present with no, mild, or severe symptoms. Symptoms may include lethargy, loss of weight, colonic ulcerations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or bloody diarrhea. Complications can include inflammation and ulceration of the colon with tissue death or perforation, which may result in peritonitis. Anemia may develop due to prolonged gastric bleeding."
Pediatric Acute Non-Lymphoblastic Leukemia,"Fever, anemia, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, skin and mucosal hemorrhage, subcutaneous nodules, hepatosplenomegaly","Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a cancer of the lymphoid line of blood cells characterized by the development of large numbers of immature lymphocytes. Symptoms may include feeling tired, pale skin color, fever, easy bleeding or bruising, enlarged lymph nodes, or bone pain. As an acute leukemia, ALL progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.
In most cases, the cause is unknown. Genetic risk factors may include Down syndrome, LiFraumeni syndrome, or neurofibromatosis type 1."
Pilar Tumor,Papules,"Proliferating trichilemmal cysts (also known as a pilar tumor, proliferating follicular cystic neoplasm, proliferating pilar tumor, and proliferating trichilemmal tumor) is a cutaneous condition, characterized by proliferations of squamous cells forming scroll-like structures.:678


== Signs and symptoms ==
The tumors, which are typically found in regions like the scalp with a high density of hair follicles, can be solid or solid cystic. Proliferating trichilemmal cyst frequently manifests clinically as a subcutaneous nodule that gradually grows into a big nodular mass. Rapid growth in some cases may be a sign of malignant development into cancer.


== Diagnosis ==
Histologically, Proliferating trichilemmal cysts are distinguished by trichilemmal keratinization, which is the sudden change from nucleated epithelium to anucleated keratinized cells without a granular layer. The differential diagnosis include trichilemmal cyst and Turban tumor."
Anal trauma,"Pain in the anal area, bleeding, anal incontinence, and stricture causing difficulty in defecation","Digital rectal examination (DRE), also known as a prostate exam (Latin: palpatio per anum (PPA), lit.'palpation through the anus'), is an internal examination of the rectum performed by a healthcare provider.
Prior to a 2018 report from the United States Preventive Services Task Force, a digital exam was a common component of annual medical examination for older men, as it was thought to be a reliable screening test for prostate cancer.


== Usage ==
This examination may be used:

for the diagnosis of prostatic disorders, benign prostatic hyperplasia and the four types of prostatitis. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, chronic bacterial prostatitis, acute (sudden) bacterial prostatitis, and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis. The DRE has a 50% specificity for benign prostatic hyperplasia."
Uveal Tumor,"Pain, fever, fatigue","Uveal melanoma is a type of eye cancer in the uvea of the eye. It is traditionally classed as originating in the iris, choroid, and ciliary body, but can also be divided into class I (low metastatic risk) and class II (high metastatic risk). Symptoms include blurred vision, loss of vision, and photopsia, but there may be no symptoms.
Tumors arise from the pigment cells that reside within the uvea and give color to the eye. These melanocytes are distinct from the retinal pigment epithelium cells underlying the retina that do not form melanomas."
Suprasellar Germinoma in Children,"Diabetes insipidus, visual impairment, visual field defects, increased intracranial pressure, high intracranial pressure syndrome, emaciation, slow growth, homonymous hemianopia, concentric narrowing of the visual field","A germinoma is a type of germ-cell tumor, which is not differentiated upon examination. It may be benign or malignant.


== Cause ==
Germinomas are thought to originate from an error of development, when certain primordial germ cells fail to migrate properly.  Germinomas lack histologic differentiation, whereas nongerminomatous germ-cell tumors display a variety of differentiation.  Like other germ-cell tumors, germinomas can undergo malignant transformation."
Rheumatic Heart Disease in the Elderly,"Fatigue, coughing, difficulty breathing, palpitations","Hypertensive heart disease includes a number of complications of high blood pressure that affect the heart. While there are several definitions of hypertensive heart disease in the medical literature, the term is most widely used in the context of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding categories. The definition includes heart failure and other cardiac complications of hypertension when a causal relationship between the heart disease and hypertension is stated or implied on the death certificate. In 2013 hypertensive heart disease resulted in 1.07 million deaths as compared with 630,000 deaths in 1990.
According to ICD-10, hypertensive heart disease (I11), and its subcategories: hypertensive heart disease with heart failure (I11.0) and hypertensive heart disease without heart failure (I11.9) are distinguished from chronic rheumatic heart diseases (I05-I09),  other forms of heart disease (I30-I52) and ischemic heart diseases (I20-I25)."
Nitrogen Dioxide Poisoning,"Coughing, fever, shortness of breath, blood-streaked sputum, extreme weakness, nausea, headache, disturbances in consciousness, agitation, convulsions, coma, decreased blood pressure, shock","Nitrogen dioxide poisoning is the illness resulting from the toxic effect of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). It usually occurs after the inhalation of the gas beyond the threshold limit value.
Nitrogen dioxide is reddish-brown with a very harsh smell at high concentrations, at lower concentrations it is colorless but may still have a harsh odour. Nitrogen dioxide poisoning depends on the duration, frequency, and intensity of exposure.
Nitrogen dioxide is an irritant of the mucous membrane linked with another air pollutant that causes pulmonary diseases such as obstructive lung disease, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and sometimes acute exacerbation of COPD and in fatal cases, deaths."
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma in the Elderly,"Persistent fever, vomiting, night sweats, chest pain, abdominal pain, papules, difficulty breathing","Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a type of lymphoma in which cancer originates from a specific type of white blood cell called lymphocytes, where multinucleated ReedSternberg cells (RS cells) are present in the lymph nodes. The condition was named after the English physician Thomas Hodgkin, who first described it in 1832. Symptoms may include fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Often, non-painful enlarged lymph nodes occur in the neck, under the arm, or in the groin. Persons affected may feel tired or be itchy."
Latent Glomerulonephritis,"Hematuria, proteinuria, oliguria, hypertension, edema, renal function impairment","Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a virus of the family Caliciviridae that causes disease in cats.  It is one of the two important viral causes of respiratory infection in cats, the other being feline herpesvirus.  FCV can be isolated from about 50% of cats with upper respiratory infections.  Cheetahs are the other species of the family Felidae known to become infected naturally.


== Viral structure and pathogenesis ==
Different strains of FCV can vary in virulence (the degree of pathogenicity within a group or species of microorganisms or viruses as indicated by case fatality rates and/or the ability of the organism to invade the tissues of the host)."
Radiation Proctitis,"Abdominal pain accompanied by nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, purulent bloody stool, and the presence of fecal and bloody discharge in the vagina","Radiation proctitis or radiation proctopathy is a condition characterized by damage to the rectum after exposure to x-rays or other ionizing radiation as a part of radiation therapy. Radiation proctopathy may occur as acute inflammation called ""acute radiation proctitis"" (and the related radiation colitis) or with chronic changes characterized by radiation associated vascular ectasiae (RAVE) and chronic radiation proctopathy.  Radiation proctitis most commonly occurs after pelvic radiation treatment for cancers such as cervical cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, and rectal cancer. RAVE and chronic radiation proctopathy involves the lower intestine, primarily the sigmoid colon and the rectum, and was previously called chronic radiation proctitis, pelvic radiation disease and radiation enteropathy.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Acute radiation proctopathy often causes pelvic pain, diarrhea, fecal urgency, and the urge to defecate despite having an empty colon (tenesmus)."
Orbital Osteosarcoma,"Pain, osseous mass, vertical movement disorder of the eyeball, eye pain, proptosis, conjunctival congestion","The following is a list of cancer types. Cancer is a group of diseases that involve abnormal increases in the number of cells, with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors or lumps are cancerous; benign tumors are not classified as being cancer because they do not spread to other parts of the body. There are over 100 different known cancers that affect humans.
Cancers are often described by the body part that they originated in."
Myocarditis,"Atypical chest pain, chest tightness, palpitations, bradycardia, arrhythmias, tachycardia, and disproportionate fever","Myocarditis is inflammation of the cardiac muscle. Myocarditis can progress to inflammatory cardiomyopathy when there is associated ventricular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction due to chronic inflammation. Symptoms can include shortness of breath, chest pain, decreased ability to exercise, and an irregular heartbeat. The duration of problems can vary from hours to months. Complications may include heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy or cardiac arrest."
Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever,"Fever, headache, nausea, anorexia, rash, bleeding, shock","Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease caused by dengue virus, prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas. Asymptomatic infections are uncommon, mild cases happen frequently; if symptoms appear, they typically begin 3 to 14 days after infection. These may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin itching and skin rash. Recovery generally takes two to seven days. In a small proportion of cases, the disease develops into severe dengue (previously known as dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome) with bleeding, low levels of blood platelets, blood plasma leakage, and dangerously low blood pressure."
Aneurysmal Bone Cyst,"Bone cyst, paraplegia, bone destruction, joint effusion","Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is a non-cancerous bone tumor composed of multiple varying sizes of spaces in a bone which are filled with blood. The term is a misnomer, as the lesion is neither an aneurysm nor a cyst. It generally presents with pain and swelling in the affected bone. Pressure on neighbouring tissues may cause compression effects such as neurological symptoms.
The cause is unknown."
Gynecological Tumors,"Abnormal menstruation, amenorrhea, lower abdominal pain, irregular vaginal bleeding, mass, increased vaginal discharge","Gynecologic oncology is a specialized field of medicine that focuses on cancers of the female reproductive system, including ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, vaginal cancer, cervical cancer, and vulvar cancer. As specialists, they have extensive training in the diagnosis and treatment of cancers.
In the United States, 82,000 women are diagnosed with gynecologic cancer annually. In 2013, an estimated 91,730 were diagnosed.
There is low quality evidence which demonstrates women with gynaecological cancer receiving treatment from specialized centres benefit from longer survival than those managed in standard care."
Karoshi (Overwork Death),"Muscle weakness, insomnia, headache, decreased sexual function, low-grade fever, dry throat","Karoshi (Japanese: , Hepburn: Karshi), which can be translated into ""overwork death"", is a Japanese term relating to occupation-related sudden death.
The most common medical causes of karoshi deaths are heart attacks and strokes due to stress and malnourishment or fasting. Mental stress from the workplace can also cause workers to commit suicide in a phenomenon known as karjisatsu ().
Karoshi is also widespread in other parts of Asia. Generally, deaths from overwork are a worldwide occurrence."
Hyponatremia,"Hyponatremia, weakness in both hands, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, headache, muscle cramp pain","Hyponatremia or hyponatraemia is a low concentration of sodium in the blood. It is generally defined as a sodium concentration of less than 135 mmol/L (135 mEq/L), with severe hyponatremia being below 120 mEq/L. Symptoms can be absent, mild or severe. Mild symptoms include a decreased ability to think, headaches, nausea, and poor balance. Severe symptoms include confusion, seizures, and coma; death can ensue.
The causes of hyponatremia are typically classified by a person's body fluid status into low volume, normal volume, or high volume."
Pediatric Beta-Thalassemia,"Anemia, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, jaundice, liver fibrosis, heart failure, liver failure, abnormal appetite, severe anemia, dizziness, macrocephaly, pigmentation abnormalities","Beta-thalassemia (-thalassemia) is an inherited blood disorder, and a form of thalassemia resulting in variable outcomes ranging from clinically asymptomatic to severe anemia individuals. It is caused by reduced or absent synthesis of the beta chains of hemoglobin, the molecule that carries oxygen in the blood. Symptoms depend on the extent to which hemoglobin is deficient, and include anemia, pallor, tiredness, enlargement of the spleen, jaundice, and gallstones. In severe cases death ensues.
Beta thalassemia occurs due to a mutation of the HBB gene leading to deficient production of the hemoglobin subunit beta-globin; the severity of the disease depends on the nature of the mutation, and whether or not the mutation is homozygous."
Pediatric alpha-thalassemia,"Mild asymptomatic, intermediate anemia, fatigue, hepatosplenomegaly, mild jaundice, severe severe anemia, jaundice edema, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, pleural effusion","Alpha-thalassemia (-thalassemia, -thalassaemia) is an inherited blood disorder and a form of thalassemia. Thalassemias are a group of inherited blood conditions which result in the impaired production of hemoglobin, the molecule that carries oxygen in the blood. Symptoms depend on the extent to which hemoglobin is deficient, and include anemia, pallor, tiredness, enlargement of the spleen, iron overload, abnormal bone structure, jaundice, and gallstones. In severe cases death ensues, often in infancy, or death of the unborn fetus.
The disease is characterised by reduced production of the alpha-globin component of hemoglobin, caused by inherited mutations affecting the genes HBA1 and HBA2."
Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma,"Eye pain, halos around lights, night blindness, visual field loss","Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can lead to damage of the optic nerve. The optic nerve transmits visual information from the eye to the brain. Glaucoma may cause vision loss if left untreated. It has been called the ""silent thief of sight"" because the loss of vision usually occurs slowly over a long period of time. A major risk factor for glaucoma is increased pressure within the eye, known as intraocular pressure (IOP)."
Omental Tumor,"Abdominal mass, anemia, abdominal pain, ascites, cachexia, and cachectic constitution","Omental cake is a radiologic sign indicative of an abnormally thickened greater omentum. It refers to infiltration of the normal omental structure by other types of soft-tissue or chronic inflammation resulting in a thickened, or cake-like appearance.


== Causes ==
Typically, it is caused by infiltration of metastatic tumors arising from the stomach, ovary, or colon. This dissemination of cancerous cells that do not originate from the omentum itself is called peritoneal carcinomatosis. It can occur other regional tumors such as lymphoma where it is associated with regional lymphadenopathy."
Clear Cell Carcinoma,"Cachexia, malaise, fatigue","Clear-cell carcinoma, also known as clear-cell adenocarcinoma and mesonephroma,  is an epithelial-cell-derived carcinoma characterized by the presence of clear cells observed during histological, diagnostic assessment. This form of cancer is classified as a rare cancer with an incidence of 4.8% in white patients, 3.1% in black patients, and 11.1% in Asian patients.
Clear-cell carcinoma may arise in multiple tissue types including the kidney (clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma), ovary (ovarian clear-cell carcinoma), uterus (uterine clear-cell carcinoma) or gastrointestinal tract (colorectal clear-cell carcinoma). 
Treatment options for clear cell carcinoma vary by the tissue type affected. It may include a combination of  chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin or irinotecan plus cisplatin) and surgical resection in ovarian clear-cell carcinoma; debulking or resection  paired with chemotherapy (cisplatin) in ovarian clear-cell carcinoma; cytokine therapy (IL-2, interferon), kinase inhibitors (temsirolimus,  sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib) and anti-angiogenic therapies (bevacizumab)."
Methotrexate-Associated Lymphoproliferative Disorders,Clinically indistinguishable from lymphomas not associated with MTX.,"EpsteinBarr virusassociated lymphoproliferative diseases (also abbreviated EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases or EBV+ LPD) are a group of disorders in which one or more types of lymphoid cells (a type of white blood cell), i.e. B cells, T cells, NK cells, and histiocytic-dendritic cells, are infected with the EpsteinBarr virus (EBV). This causes the infected cells to divide excessively, and is associated with the development of various non-cancerous, pre-cancerous, and cancerous lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs). These LPDs include the well-known disorder occurring during the initial infection with the EBV, infectious mononucleosis, and the large number of subsequent disorders that may occur thereafter. The virus is usually involved in the development and/or progression of these LPDs although in some cases it may be an ""innocent"" bystander, i.e."
Neurofibromatosis,"Presents with intellectual decline, memory disorders, epileptic seizures, limb weakness, numbness, and skin pigmentation spots, which appear light brown, dark brown, or coffee-colored","Neurofibromatosis (NF) refers to a group of three distinct genetic conditions in which tumors grow in the nervous system. The tumors are non-cancerous (benign) and often involve the skin or surrounding bone. Although symptoms are often mild, each condition presents differently. Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is typically characterized by caf au lait spots (light-brown flat patches of skin), neurofibromas (small bumps in or under the skin), scoliosis (side-way curvature of the back), and headaches. Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2), on the other hand, may present with early-onset hearing loss, cataracts, tinnitus, difficulty walking or maintaining balance, and muscle atrophy."
Acute Leukemia,"Fever, anemia, bleeding, infection, weight loss, joint pain, intracranial hemorrhage","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal cells that build up in the bone marrow and blood and interfere with normal blood cell production. Symptoms may include feeling tired, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. Occasionally, spread may occur to the brain, skin, or gums. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly, and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.
Risk factors include getting older, being male, smoking, previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy, myelodysplastic syndrome, and exposure to the chemical benzene."
Abdominal Fibrosarcoma,"Abdominal mass, anemia, cancer pain, fever, weight loss","Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is a very rare malignant tumor of soft tissues that on microscopic examination consists of small round or ovoid neoplastic epithelioid fibroblast-like cells, i.e. cells that have features resembling both epithelioid cells and fibroblasts. In 2020, the World Health Organization classified SEF as a distinct tumor type in the category of malignant fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors. However, current studies have reported that low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma (LGFMS) has many clinically and pathologically important features characteristic of SEF; these studies suggest that LGSFMS may be an early form of, and over time progress to become, a SEF. Since the World Health Organization has classified LGFMS as one of the malignant fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors that is distinctly different than SEF, SEF and LGFMS are here regarded as different tumor forms. 
Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcomas are aggressive tumors that usually develop in adults and elderly individuals or, in a small minority of cases, children."
Pediatric Rhabdomyosarcoma,"Weakness, anorexia, palpable mass, weight loss","Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a highly aggressive form of cancer that develops from mesenchymal cells that have failed to fully differentiate into myocytes of skeletal muscle. Cells of the tumor are identified as rhabdomyoblasts.
The four subtypes are embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, and spindle-cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma. Embryonal and alveolar are the main groups, and these types are the most common soft tissue sarcomas of childhood and adolescence. The pleomorphic type is usually found in adults."
Acute Subdural Hematoma,"History of head injury, headache, projectile vomiting, coma, lucid interval, restlessness","A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a type of bleeding in which a collection of bloodusually but not always associated with a traumatic brain injurygathers between the inner layer of the dura mater and the arachnoid mater of the meninges surrounding the brain. It usually results from rips in bridging veins that cross the subdural space.
Subdural hematomas may cause an increase in the pressure inside the skull, which in turn can cause compression of and damage to delicate brain tissue. Acute subdural hematomas are often life-threatening. Chronic subdural hematomas have a better prognosis if properly managed."
Pediatric Leukemia,"Anemia, recurrent high fever, persistent fever, fever, bleeding spots on mucous membranes, sternal tenderness, generalized weakness","Childhood leukemia is leukemia that occurs in a child and is a type of childhood cancer. Childhood leukemia is the most common childhood cancer, accounting for 29% of cancers in children aged 014 in 2018. There are multiple forms of leukemia that occur in children, the most common being acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) followed by acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Survival rates vary depending on the type of leukemia, but may be as high as 90% in ALL.
Leukemia is a hematological malignancy or a cancer of the blood. It develops in the bone marrow, the soft inner part of bones where new blood cells are made."
Polymorphic Light Eruption,"Papules, pruritus, polymorphic erythema","Polymorphous light eruption (PLE)  presents with itchy red small bumps on sun-exposed skin, particularly face, neck, forearms and legs. It generally appears 30 minutes to a few hours after sun exposure and may last between one and 14 days.  The bumps may become small blisters or plaques and may appear bloody,often healing with minimal scarring. 
It is a non-life-threatening and potentially distressing skin condition that is triggered by sunlight and artificial UV exposure in a genetically susceptible person, particularly in temperate climates during the spring and early summer. Due to its many clinical appearances, it is named polymorphic or polymorphous and the terms are used interchangeably."
Pulmonary Metastasis,"Chest pain, hemoptysis, cough, dyspnea, dry cough, bloody sputum, chest tightness, rapid breathing","Metastasis is a pathogenic agent's spreading from an initial or primary site to a different or secondary site within the host's body; the term is typically used when referring to metastasis by a cancerous tumor.  The newly pathological sites, then, are metastases (mets). It is generally distinguished from cancer invasion, which is the direct extension and penetration by cancer cells into neighboring tissues.
Cancer occurs after cells are genetically altered to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. This uncontrolled proliferation by mitosis produces a primary heterogeneic tumour."
Benign Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone,"Joint pain, limb swelling, fractures","A bone tumor is an abnormal growth of tissue in bone, traditionally classified as noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). Cancerous bone tumors usually originate from a cancer in another part of the body such as from lung, breast, thyroid, kidney and prostate.  There may be a lump, pain, or neurological signs from pressure. A bone tumor might present with a pathologic fracture. Other symptoms may include fatigue, fever, weight loss, anemia and nausea."
Esophageal Disease,"Dysphagia, sensation of choking, abdominal pain","Esophageal diseases can derive from congenital conditions, or they can be acquired later in life.
Many people experience a burning sensation in their chest occasionally, caused by stomach acids refluxing into the esophagus, normally called heartburn. Extended exposure to heartburn may erode the lining of the esophagus, leading potentially to Barrett's esophagus which is associated with an increased risk of adenocarcinoma most commonly found in the distal one-third of the esophagus.
Some people also experience a sensation known as globus esophagus, where it feels as if a ball is lodged in the lower part of the esophagus.
The following are additional diseases and conditions that affect the esophagus:

Achalasia
Acute esophageal necrosis
Barrett's esophagus
Boerhaave syndrome
Caustic injury to the esophagus
Chagas disease
Diffuse esophageal spasm
Esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula
Esophageal cancer
Esophageal dysphagia
Esophageal varices
Esophageal web
Esophagitis
GERD
Hiatus hernia
KillianJamieson diverticulum
MalloryWeiss syndrome
Neurogenic dysphagia
Nutcracker esophagus
Schatzki's ring
Zenker's diverticulum

Salt-Sensitive Hypertension,"Significant fluctuations in blood pressure, hypertension","Hypertension is a condition characterized by an elevated blood pressure in which the long term consequences include cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, adrenal gland tumors, vision impairment, memory loss, metabolic syndrome, stroke and dementia. It affects nearly 1 in 2 Americans and remains as a contributing cause of death in the United States. There are many genetic and environmental factors involved with the development of hypertension including genetics, diet, and stress.        

The brain is one of the major organs affected by hypertension and recent findings have linked hypertension to various forms of cognitive decline. Not only does hypertension affect the cellular structure and molecular composition of blood vessels (arteries, veins, capillaries), it also affects their ability to regulate vital functions that are essential for healthy brain function such as oxygen and glucose delivery, cerebral environment control via the blood-brain barrier, and trafficking of immune cells and metabolic by-products."
Orbital Cellulitis,"High fever, chills, and symptoms of meningeal irritation","Orbital cellulitis  is inflammation of eye tissues behind the orbital septum. It is most commonly caused by an acute spread of infection into the eye socket from either the adjacent sinuses or through the blood. It may also occur after trauma.  When it affects the rear of the eye, it is known as retro-orbital cellulitis.
Without proper treatment, orbital cellulitis may lead to serious consequences, including permanent loss of vision or even death."
Pneumothorax,"Chest tightness, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, chest pain","A pneumothorax is collection of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. In a minority of cases, a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, and the amount of air in the space between chest wall and lungs increases; this is called a tension pneumothorax. This can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. This leads to a type of shock called obstructive shock, which can be fatal unless reversed."
Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma of the Skin,"Presents at birth with persistent cyanosis, polymorphous erythematous rash, reticulated to patchy pigmentation, telangiectasia, tubular nails, and diffuse flushing of the body.","Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a rare type of cancer that can exist in many different body sites. This tumor most often occurs in the salivary glands, but it can also be found in many anatomic sites, including the breast, lacrimal gland, lung, brain, Bartholin gland, trachea, and the paranasal sinuses.
It is the third-most common malignant salivary gland tumor overall (after mucoepidermoid carcinoma and polymorphous adenocarcinoma). It represents 28% of malignant submandibular gland tumors, making it the single most common malignant salivary gland tumor in this region.  Patients may survive for years with metastases because this tumor is generally well-differentiated and slow growing."
Congenital Intestinal Malrotation,"Emaciation, shock, fever, dehydration, nausea and vomiting, rectal bleeding","Intestinal malrotation is a congenital anomaly of rotation of the midgut. It occurs during the first trimester as the fetal gut undergoes a complex series of growth and development. Malrotation can lead to a dangerous complication called volvulus, in which cases emergency surgery is indicated. Malrotation can refer to a spectrum of abnormal intestinal positioning, often including:

The small intestine found predominantly on the right side of the abdomen
The cecum displaced from its usual position in the right lower quadrant into the epigastrium or right hypochondrium
An absent or displaced ligament of Treitz
Fibrous peritoneal bands called bands of Ladd running across the vertical portion of the duodenum
An unusually narrow, stalk-like mesentery
The position of the intestines, narrow mesentery and Ladd's bands can contribute to several severe gastrointestinal conditions. The narrow mesentery predisposes some cases of malrotation to midgut volvulus, a twisting of the entire small bowel that can obstruct the mesenteric blood vessels leading to intestinal ischemia, necrosis, and death if not promptly treated."
Retinoblastoma,"Visual impairment, eye pain, increased intraocular pressure, strabismus, fundus changes, headache, conjunctival congestion, pale yellow pupil reflex","Retinoblastoma (Rb) is a rare form of cancer that rapidly develops from the immature cells of a retina, the light-detecting tissue of the eye. It is the most common primary malignant intraocular cancer in children, and 80% of retinoblastoma cases are first detected in those under 3 years old.
Though most children in high income countries survive this cancer, they may lose their vision in the affected eye(s) or need to have the eye removed.
Almost half of children with retinoblastoma have a hereditary genetic defect associated with it. In other cases, retinoblastoma is caused by a congenital mutation in the chromosome 13 gene 13q14 (retinoblastoma protein)."
Choroidal Hemangioma,"Visual impairment, vascular malformation, spontaneous intraocular hemorrhage","An eye neoplasm is a tumor of the eye. A rare type of tumor, eye neoplasms can affect all parts of the eye, and can either be benign or malignant (cancerous), in which case it is known as eye cancer. Eye cancers can be primary (starts within the eye) or metastatic cancer (spread to the eye from another organ). The two most common cancers that spread to the eye from another organ are breast cancer and lung cancer. Other less common sites of origin include the prostate, kidney, thyroid, skin, colon and blood or bone marrow."
Urinary System Tumor,"Hematuria, frequent urination, unexplained fever","Bladder cancer is the abnormal growth of cells in the bladder. These cells can grow to form a tumor, which eventually spreads, damaging the bladder and other organs. Most people with bladder cancer are diagnosed after noticing blood in their urine. Those suspected of having bladder cancer typically have their bladder inspected by a thin medical camera, a procedure called cystoscopy. Suspected tumors are removed and examined to determine if they are cancerous."
Prostatic Cyst,"Urgency of urination, frequent urination, straining to urinate, thin urinary stream, difficulty in urinating, and urinary retention","Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also called prostate enlargement, is a noncancerous increase in size of the prostate gland. Symptoms may include frequent urination, trouble starting to urinate, weak stream, inability to urinate, or loss of bladder control. Complications can include urinary tract infections, bladder stones, and chronic kidney problems.
The cause is unclear. Risk factors include a family history, obesity, type 2 diabetes, not enough exercise, and erectile dysfunction."
Aortoenteric Fistula,"Fever, Ureteral Fistula, Intestinal Vascular Malformation, Intestinal Dysmotility, Pulsatile Mass, Intestinal Helminthiasis, Aortic Sinus Rupture, Abdominal Pain","An aortoenteric fistula is a connection between the aorta and the intestines, stomach, or esophageus. There can be significant blood loss into the intestines resulting in bloody stool and death. It is usually secondary to an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The third or fourth portion of the duodenum is the most common site for aortoenteric fistulas, followed by the jejunum and ileum.


== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis is typically via a CT angiography, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, or arteriography."
Schistosomiasis,"Fever, dysuria, hematuria, headache, urinary urgency, bladder irritation, chills, fatigue, hyperhidrosis, hepatosplenomegaly, liver fibrosis, palpitations","Schistosomiasis, also known as snail fever, bilharzia, and Katayama fever is a disease caused by parasitic flatworms called schistosomes. It affects the urinary tract or the intestines. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, or blood in the urine. Those who have been infected for a long time may experience liver damage, kidney failure, infertility, or bladder cancer. In children, schistosomiasis may cause poor growth and learning difficulties."
Vascular Injury,"Bleeding, dizziness, pallor","Vascular surgery is a surgical subspecialty in which vascular diseases involving the arteries, veins, or lymphatic vessels, are managed by medical therapy, minimally-invasive catheter procedures and surgical reconstruction. The specialty evolved from general and cardiovascular surgery where it refined the management of just the vessels, no longer treating the heart or other organs. Modern vascular surgery includes open surgery techniques, endovascular (minimally invasive) techniques and medical management of vascular diseases - unlike the parent specialities. The vascular surgeon is trained in the diagnosis and management of diseases affecting all parts of the vascular system excluding the coronaries and intracranial vasculature. Vascular surgeons also are called to assist other physicians to carry out surgery near vessels, or to salvage vascular injuries that include hemorrhage control, dissection, occlusion or simply for safe exposure of vascular structures."
Malignant Tumor of the Sphenoid Sinus,"Ptosis, diplopia, cranial nerve palsy, esotropia, exophthalmos, diabetes insipidus","A brain tumor (sometimes referred more commonly as brain cancer) occurs when a group of cells within the brain turn cancerous and grow out of control, creating a mass. There are two main types of tumors: malignant (cancerous) tumors and benign (non-cancerous) tumors. These can be further classified as primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which most commonly have spread from tumors located outside the brain, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the size of the tumor and the part of the brain that is involved. Where symptoms exist, they may include headaches, seizures, problems with vision, vomiting and mental changes."
Ovarian Fibroma,"Abdominal pain, abdominal mass, ascites, pelvic heaviness, severe unilateral lower abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding","The ovarian fibroma, also fibroma, is a benign sex cord-stromal tumour.
Ovarian fibromas represent 4% of all ovarian neoplasms. They tend to occur mostly during perimenopause and postmenopause, the median age having been reported to be about 52 years, and they are rare in children. Lesions tend to be asymptomatic. If symptoms are present, the most common one is abdominal pain."
Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM),"Headache, high fever, vomiting, coma, opisthotonos, drooping shoulders, nausea and vomiting, altered mental status, increased saliva secretion","Naegleriasis, also known as primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), is an almost invariably fatal infection of the brain by the free-living protozoan Naegleria fowleri. Symptoms include headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, a stiff neck, confusion, hallucinations and seizures. Symptoms progress rapidly over around five days with characteristics of both meningitis and encephalitis, making it a type of meningoencephalitis. Death usually results within one to two weeks of symptom onset.
N. fowleri is typically found in warm bodies of fresh water, such as ponds, lakes, rivers and hot springs."
Pancreatic Body Cancer,"Abdominal pain, jaundice, diarrhea","Pancreatic cancer arises when cells in the pancreas, a glandular organ behind the stomach, begin to multiply out of control and form a mass. These cancerous cells have the ability to invade other parts of the body. A number of types of pancreatic cancer are known.
The most common, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, accounts for about 90% of cases, and the term ""pancreatic cancer"" is sometimes used to refer only to that type. These adenocarcinomas start within the part of the pancreas that makes digestive enzymes."
Angiosarcoma,"Angiogenesis, systemic vascular damage, arteriosclerosis","Angiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive cancer that starts in the endothelial cells that line the walls of blood vessels or lymphatic vessels. Since they are made from vascular lining, they can appear anywhere and at any age, but older people are more commonly affected, and the skin is the most affected area, with approximately 60% of cases being cutaneous (skin). Specifically, the scalp makes up ~50% of angiosarcoma cases, but this is still <0.1% of all head and neck tumors. Since angiosarcoma is an umbrella term for many types of tumor that vary greatly in origin and location, many symptoms may occur, from completely asymptomatic to non-specific symptoms like skin lesions, ulceration, shortness of breath and abdominal pain. Multiple-organ involvement at time of diagnosis is common and makes it difficult to ascertain origin and how to treat it."
Urogenital Schistosomiasis,"Hematuria, Chest pain, Anemia, Weight loss, Itchy skin, Erythematous rash, Urticarial rash, High fever, Cough, Chills, Hepatosplenomegaly, Frequent urination with urgency and dysuria","Schistosomiasis, also known as snail fever, bilharzia, and Katayama fever is a disease caused by parasitic flatworms called schistosomes. It affects the urinary tract or the intestines. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, or blood in the urine. Those who have been infected for a long time may experience liver damage, kidney failure, infertility, or bladder cancer. In children, schistosomiasis may cause poor growth and learning difficulties."
Tuberous Sclerosis,"Facial angiofibromas with a butterfly distribution, epilepsy, cognitive impairment","Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare multisystem autosomal dominant genetic disease that causes non-cancerous tumours to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, liver, eyes, lungs and skin. A combination of symptoms may include seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delay, behavioral problems, skin abnormalities, lung disease, and kidney disease.
TSC is caused by a mutation of either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which code for the proteins hamartin and tuberin, respectively, with TSC2 mutations accounting for the majority and tending to cause more severe symptoms. These proteins act as tumor growth suppressors, agents that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation.
Prognosis is highly variable and depends on the symptoms, but life expectancy is normal for many."
Acute Appendicitis,"Migratory or right lower abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, fever with chills, tenderness and rebound pain in the right lower abdomen, abdominal muscle rigidity, constipation, or diarrhea","Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. Symptoms commonly include right lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever and decreased appetite. However, approximately 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms. Severe complications of a ruptured appendix include widespread, painful inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall and sepsis.
Appendicitis is primarily caused by a blockage of the hollow portion in the appendix."
Ureteral Tumor,"Hematuria, oliguria, urinary frequency, renal area pain","Ureteral cancer is cancer of the ureters, muscular tubes that propel urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder.  It is also known as ureter cancer, renal pelvic cancer, and rarely ureteric cancer or uretal cancer. Cancer in this location is rare. Ureteral cancer becomes more likely in older adults, usually ages 7080, who have previously been diagnosed with bladder cancer.
Ureteral cancer is usually a transitional cell carcinoma."
Hyperkalemia,"Arrhythmia, bradycardia, cardiac enlargement, numbness in hands and feet, high blood potassium, metabolic acidosis, cardiac tremors, paralysis, cardiac arrest, faint heart sounds, sinus arrest, ventricular flutter","Hyperkalemia is an elevated level of potassium (K+) in the blood. Normal potassium levels are between 3.5 and 5.0 mmol/L (3.5 and 5.0 mEq/L) with levels above 5.5 mmol/L defined as hyperkalemia. Typically hyperkalemia does not cause symptoms. Occasionally when severe it can cause palpitations, muscle pain, muscle weakness, or numbness. Hyperkalemia can cause an abnormal heart rhythm which can result in cardiac arrest and death."
Colchamine Poisoning,"Nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, sweating, coughing, accelerated breathing, respiratory distress, diarrhea, abdominal pain, urinary burning, seizures, convulsions","Colchicine is a medication used to prevent and treat gout, to treat familial Mediterranean fever and Behet's disease, and to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction. The American College of Rheumatology recommends colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or steroids in the treatment of gout. Other uses for colchicine include the management of pericarditis. 
Colchicine is taken by mouth. The injectable route of administration for colchicine can be toxic."
Autoimmune Progesterone Dermatitis,"Pruritus, papules, wheals, oral ulcers, dermatitis, vesicular or bullous lesions, urticaria-like rash, erythema multiforme-like rash","Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis (APD) occurs during the luteal phase of a woman's menstrual cycle and is an uncommon cyclic premenstrual reaction to progesterone. It can present itself in several ways, including eczema, erythema multiforme, urticaria, angioedema, and progesterone-induced anaphylaxis. The first case of autoimmune progesterone dermatitis was identified in 1964. Reproductive function may be impacted by APD.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Skin lesions can present as purpura, urticaria, erythema multiforme, folliculitis, eczema, papulovesicular eruptions, fixed drug eruptions, or vulvovaginal pruritus. There are also reports of anaphylaxis."
Radiotherapy,,"Radiation therapy or radiotherapy (RT, RTx, or XRT) is a treatment using ionizing radiation, generally provided as part of cancer therapy to either kill or control the growth of malignant cells. It is normally delivered by a linear particle accelerator. Radiation therapy may be curative in a number of types of cancer if they are localized to one area of the body, and have not spread to other parts. It may also be used as part of adjuvant therapy, to prevent tumor recurrence after surgery to remove a primary malignant tumor (for example, early stages of breast cancer). Radiation therapy is synergistic with chemotherapy, and has been used before, during, and after chemotherapy in susceptible cancers."
Esophageal Polyps,A sensation of a foreign body in the throat or the presence of a lump in the throat (oral cavity),"A polyp is an abnormal growth of tissue projecting from a mucous membrane. If it is attached to the surface by a narrow elongated stalk, it is said to be pedunculated; if it is attached without a stalk, it is said to be sessile. 
Polyps are commonly found in the colon, stomach, nose, ear, sinus(es), urinary bladder, and uterus. They may also occur elsewhere in the body where there are mucous membranes, including the cervix, vocal folds, and small intestine. Some polyps are tumors (neoplasms) and others are non-neoplastic, for example hyperplastic or dysplastic, which are benign."
Pediatric Acute Pancreatitis,"Fever, upper abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pressure pain and rebound pain, a sensation of a 'band' around the upper abdomen and back, and bluish-gray discoloration around the navel or on both sides of the waist","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a type of respiratory failure characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs. Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnea), rapid breathing (tachypnea), and bluish skin coloration (cyanosis). For those who survive, a decreased quality of life is common.
Causes may include sepsis, pancreatitis, trauma, pneumonia, and aspiration. The underlying mechanism involves diffuse injury to cells which form the barrier of the microscopic air sacs of the lungs, surfactant dysfunction, activation of the immune system, and dysfunction of the body's regulation of blood clotting."
Endometrial Cancer,"Bloody discharge, Pyometra, Vaginal metastasis, Postmenopausal bleeding, Menstrual disorder, Endometrial hyperplasia, Vaginal bleeding, Lower abdominal pain","Endometrial cancer is a cancer that arises from the endometrium (the lining of the uterus or womb). It is the result of the abnormal growth of cells that can invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause."
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection,"Seizures, biliary obstruction, sepsis, deafness, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, lymphadenopathy, decreased immunity","Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), also called human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5), is a species of virus in the genus Cytomegalovirus, which in turn is a member of the viral family known as Herpesviridae or herpesviruses.  It is also commonly called CMV. Within Herpesviridae, HCMV belongs to the Betaherpesvirinae subfamily, which also includes cytomegaloviruses from other mammals. CMV is a double-stranded DNA virus.
Although they may be found throughout the body, HCMV infections are frequently associated with the salivary glands. HCMV infection is typically unnoticed in healthy people, but can be life-threatening for the immunocompromised, such as HIV-infected persons, organ transplant recipients, or newborn infants."
Oral and maxillofacial injuries,"Restlessness, sweating, flaring of nostrils, inhalation longer than exhalation, stridor, cyanosis, three depression sign, difficulty in feeding, speech disorder","Oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) is a surgical specialty focusing on reconstructive surgery of the face, facial trauma surgery, the mouth, head and neck, and jaws, as well as facial plastic surgery including cleft lip and cleft palate surgery.


== Specialty ==
An oral and maxillofacial surgeon is a specialist surgeon who treats the entire craniomaxillofacial complex: anatomical area of the mouth, jaws, face, and skull, head and neck as well as associated structures. Depending upon the national jurisdiction, oral and maxillofacial surgery may require a degree in medicine, dentistry or both.


=== United States ===
In the U.S., oral and maxillofacial surgeons, whether possessing a single or dual degree, may further specialise after residency, undergoing additional one or two year sub-specialty oral and maxillofacial surgery fellowship training in the following areas:

Cosmetic facial surgery, including eyelid (blepharoplasty), nose (rhinoplasty), facial lift, brow lift, and laser resurfacing
Cranio-maxillofacial trauma, including zygomatic (cheek bone), orbital (eye socket), mandibular and nasal fractures as well as facial soft tissue lacerations and penetrating neck injuries
Craniofacial surgery/paediatric maxillofacial surgery, including cleft lip and palate surgery and trans-cranial craniofacial surgery including Fronto-Orbital Advancement and Remodelling (FOAR) and total vault remodelling
Head and neck cancer and microvascular reconstruction free flap surgery
Maxillofacial regeneration, which is re-formation of the facial region by advanced stem cell technique


=== United Kingdom and Europe ===
In countries such as the UK and most of Europe, it is recognised as a specialty of medicine with a degree in medicine and an additional degree in dentistry being compulsory. The scope of practice is mainly head and neck cancer, microvascular reconstruction, craniofacial surgery and cranio-maxillofacial trauma, skin cancer, facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, craniofacial surgery, TMJ surgery and cosmetic facial surgery."
Eisenmenger's Syndrome,"Cyanosis of lips, difficulty breathing, palpitations, shortness of breath","Eisenmenger syndrome or Eisenmenger's syndrome is defined as the process in which a long-standing left-to-right cardiac shunt caused by a congenital heart defect (typically by a ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, or less commonly, patent ductus arteriosus) causes pulmonary hypertension and  eventual reversal of the shunt into a cyanotic right-to-left shunt. Because of the advent of fetal screening with echocardiography early in life, the incidence of heart defects progressing to Eisenmenger syndrome has decreased.
Eisenmenger syndrome in a pregnant mother can cause serious complications, though successful delivery has been reported. Maternal mortality ranges from 30% to 60%, and may be attributed to fainting spells, blood clots forming in the veins and traveling to distant sites, hypovolemia, coughing up blood or preeclampsia. Most deaths occur either during or within the first weeks after delivery."
Primary Liver Cancer,"Discomfort in the upper right abdomen, abdominal bloating, fatigue, poor appetite, decreased appetite, ascites, jaundice, liver area pain, weight loss, hepatomegaly, liver area pain","Liver cancer, also known as hepatic cancer, primary hepatic cancer, or primary hepatic malignancy, is cancer that starts in the liver. Liver cancer can be primary in which the cancer starts in the liver, or it can be liver metastasis, or secondary, in which the cancer spreads from elsewhere in the body to the liver. Liver metastasis is the more common of the two liver cancers. Instances of liver cancer are increasing globally. 
Primary liver cancer is globally the sixth-most frequent cancer and the fourth-leading cause of death from cancer."
Postpartum Blood Deficiency Fever,"Postpartum fever generally presents as low-grade fever, more pronounced in the afternoon, or significant heat sensation, resembling high fever, but with a preference for warmth. The patient's complexion may appear pale or sallow, accompanied by dizziness, blurred vision, tinnitus, palpitations, or restlessness and internal heat, with a flushed face as if painted with vermilion, yet also feeling chills and a preference for warm drinks. There is often a history of excessive blood loss during and after childbirth. Laboratory tests may show reduced red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit levels.","Bleeding, hemorrhage, haemorrhage or blood loss, is blood escaping from the circulatory system from damaged blood vessels. Bleeding can occur internally, or externally either through a natural opening such as the mouth, nose, ear, urethra, vagina, or anus, or through a puncture in the skin.
Hypovolemia is a massive decrease in blood volume, and death by excessive loss of blood is referred to as exsanguination. Typically, a healthy person can endure a loss of 1015% of the total blood volume without serious medical difficulties (by comparison, blood donation typically takes 810% of the donor's blood volume). The stopping or controlling of bleeding is called hemostasis and is an important part of both first aid and surgery."
Skin Tumor,"Dark red, firm wart-like nodules, wax-like luster of hard nodules","A neoplasm () is a type of abnormal and excessive growth of tissue. The process that occurs to form or produce a neoplasm is called neoplasia. The growth of a neoplasm is uncoordinated with that of the normal surrounding tissue, and persists in growing abnormally, even if the original trigger is removed. This abnormal growth usually forms a mass, which may be called a tumour or tumor.
ICD-10 classifies neoplasms into four main groups: benign neoplasms, in situ neoplasms, malignant neoplasms, and neoplasms of uncertain or unknown behavior."
Mastocytosis,"Joint pain, bone pain, papules, maculopapular rash, fatigue, itching, vomiting, ulcers, diarrhea, edema, petechiae, purpura","Mastocytosis, a type of mast cell disease, is a rare disorder affecting both children and adults caused by the accumulation of functionally defective mast cells (also called mastocytes) and CD34+ mast cell precursors.
People affected by mastocytosis are susceptible to a variety of symptoms, including itching, hives, and anaphylactic shock, caused by the release of histamine and other pro-inflammatory substances from mast cells.


== Signs and symptoms ==

When mast cells undergo degranulation, the substances that are released can cause a number of symptoms that can vary over time and can range in intensity from mild to severe. Because mast cells play a role in allergic reactions, the symptoms of mastocytosis often are similar to the symptoms of an allergic reaction. They may include, but are not limited to

Fatigue
Skin lesions (urticaria pigmentosa), itching, and dermatographic urticaria (skin writing)
""Darier's Sign"", a reaction to stroking or scratching of urticaria lesions."
Alcoholic Cerebellar Degeneration,"Cerebellar signs, unsteady gait, ataxia, intention tremor, alcohol craving, abnormal gait, breath smelling of alcohol, impaired judgment and orientation, cerebellar malformation, alcoholic hallucinosis, drunken gait","Cerebellar degeneration is a condition in which cerebellar cells, otherwise known as neurons, become damaged and progressively weaken in the cerebellum. There are two types of cerebellar degeneration; paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, and alcoholic or nutritional cerebellar degeneration. As the cerebellum contributes to the coordination and regulation of motor activities, as well as controlling equilibrium of the human body, any degeneration to this part of the organ can be life-threatening. Cerebellar degeneration can result in disorders in fine movement, posture, and motor learning in humans, due to a disturbance of the vestibular system. This condition may not only cause cerebellar damage on a temporary or permanent basis, but can also affect other tissues of the central nervous system, those including the cerebral cortex, spinal cord and the brainstem (made up of the medulla oblongata, midbrain, and pons)."
Hypokalemic Nephropathy,"Arrhythmia, polydipsia, polyuria, nocturia, limb weakness, intestinal paresis with flaccidity, absent tendon reflexes, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, thyrotoxic crisis","The chronic kidney disease of the cat (CKD or CNE)  also called chronic renal insufficiency (CRI or CNI) or chronic renal failure (CRF) in the older literature  is an incurable, progressive disease characterized by a gradual decrease in the nephrons and thus to a decreasing function (insufficiency) of the kidneys. It is one of the most common causes of death in older domestic cats. In current literature, the term ""kidney disease"" is preferred to the term ""renal insufficiency"" because the disease initially progresses without any measurable decline in kidney function. Due to the different type of diet and the resulting metabolic peculiarities, the clinical picture and treatment sometimes differ significantly from chronic renal failure in humans.
Chronic kidney disease occurs in cats as a result of inflammation of the renal tubules and the renal interstitial tissue without an identifiable cause (idiopathic tubulointerstitial nephritis)."
Duodenal adenocarcinoma,"Blunt pain, nausea, abdominal pain, melena, jaundice, ulcers, anemia, upper abdominal discomfort","Duodenal cancer is a cancer in the first section of the small intestine known as the duodenum. Cancer of the duodenum is relatively rare compared to stomach cancer and colorectal cancer. Its histology is usually adenocarcinoma.
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Gardner syndrome, Lynch syndrome, MuirTorre syndrome, celiac disease, PeutzJeghers syndrome, Crohn's disease and juvenile polyposis syndrome are risk factors for developing this cancer.
The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine."
Traumatic Breast Hematoma,"Breast swelling, pain, tenderness","Breast hematoma  is a collection of blood within the breast. It arises from internal bleeding (hemorrhage) and may arise due to trauma (breast injury or surgery) or due to a non-traumatic cause.


== Symptoms ==
Symptoms may include visible discoloring (ecchymosis), breast pain, and swelling.
The symptoms may be similar to those of fibrocystic breast changes.


== Causes ==
A breast hematoma may appear due to direct trauma to the breast, for example from a sports injury or a road accident, for example a vehicle collision in which a seat belt injury occurs."
Respiratory Disease-Associated Psychiatric Disorders,"Abnormal behavior and emotions, depression, confusion, edema, somnolence, hypersomnia, coma, fear, anxiety, restlessness","A disease is a particular abnormal condition that adversely affects the structure or function of all or part of an organism and is not immediately due to any external injury. Diseases are often known to be medical conditions that are associated with specific signs and symptoms. A disease may be caused by external factors such as pathogens or by internal dysfunctions. For example, internal dysfunctions of the immune system can produce a variety of different diseases, including various forms of immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity, allergies, and autoimmune disorders.
In humans, disease is often used more broadly to refer to any condition that causes pain, dysfunction, distress, social problems, or death to the person affected, or similar problems for those in contact with the person."
Headache caused by Intracranial Space-Occupying Lesion,"Headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting","Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), also known as intracranial bleed, is bleeding within the skull. Subtypes are intracerebral bleeds (intraventricular bleeds and intraparenchymal bleeds), subarachnoid bleeds, epidural bleeds, and subdural bleeds.
Intracerebral bleeding affects 2.5 per 10,000 people each year.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Intracranial hemorrhage is a serious medical emergency because the buildup of blood within the skull can lead to increases in intracranial pressure, which can crush delicate brain tissue or limit its blood supply.  Severe increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) can cause brain herniation, in which parts of the brain are squeezed past structures in the skull."
Paget's Disease of the Breast,"Itching or intense itching of the nipple, burning sensation, followed by redness of the nipple and areola skin, presence of yellowish-brown scaly crusts, revealing slight skin erosion under the crust, presenting as chronic eczematous changes.","Paget's disease of the breast (also known as mammary Paget's disease) is a rare skin change at the nipple nearly always associated with underlying breast cancer. Paget's disease of the breast was first described by Sir James Paget in 1874. The condition is an uncommon disease accounting for 1 to 4% of all breast cancers cases. 92% to 100% of patients with Paget's disease of the breast have an underlying breast cancer.
The condition in itself often appears innocuous, limited to a surface appearance and it is sometimes dismissed, although it is actually indicative of underlying breast cancer."
Acute Non-Lymphocytic Leukemia in the Elderly,"Joint pain, anemia, recurrent fever, persistent fever, facial skin with nodular hyperplasia","Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. In CLL, the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell. In patients with CLL, B cell lymphocytes can begin to collect in their blood, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. These cells do not function well and crowd out healthy blood cells. CLL is divided into two main types:

Slow-growing CLL (indolent CLL)
Fast-growing CLL
Many people do not have any symptoms when they are first diagnosed."
Microinvasive Carcinoma of the Cervix,"Increased vaginal discharge, contact bleeding, or irregular vaginal bleeding","Cervical cancer is a cancer arising from the cervix or in any layer of the wall of the cervix. It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that can invade or spread to other parts of the body. Early on, typically no symptoms are seen. Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain or pain during sexual intercourse. While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer."
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Children,"Anemia, pallor, hematuria, irregular fever, pale skin, pale lips, shortness of breath after activity, palpitations, edema, skin purpura, ecchymosis","Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a cancer of the lymphoid line of blood cells characterized by the development of large numbers of immature lymphocytes. Symptoms may include feeling tired, pale skin color, fever, easy bleeding or bruising, enlarged lymph nodes, or bone pain. As an acute leukemia, ALL progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.
In most cases, the cause is unknown. Genetic risk factors may include Down syndrome, LiFraumeni syndrome, or neurofibromatosis type 1."
Chronic Pelvic Pain,"Pelvic pain, menstrual pain, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, fatigue","Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS), previously known as chronic nonbacterial prostatitis, is long-term pelvic pain and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) without evidence of a bacterial infection. It affects about 26% of men. Together with IC/BPS, it makes up urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS).
The cause is unknown. Diagnosis involves ruling out other potential causes of the symptoms such as bacterial prostatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, overactive bladder, and cancer."
Cryptococcosis,"Low fever, nausea, restlessness, lung infection, cellulitis, high fever, difficulty breathing, carbuncle","Cryptococcosis is a potentially fatal fungal infection of mainly the lungs, presenting as a pneumonia, and in the brain, where it appears as a meningitis. Coughing, difficulty breathing, chest pain and fever are seen when the lungs are infected. When the brain is infected, symptoms include headache, fever, neck pain, nausea and vomiting, light sensitivity and confusion or changes in behavior. It can also affect other parts of the body including skin, where it may appear as several fluid-filled nodules with dead tissue.
It is caused by the fungi Cryptococcus neoformans or less commonly Cryptococcus gattii, and is acquired by breathing in the spores from the air."
Traumatic shock,"Coma, apathetic expression, clouded consciousness, tachycardia, pallor, cold sweat, apathy, and rapid breathing","Shock is the state of insufficient blood flow to the tissues of the body as a result of problems with the circulatory system. Initial symptoms of shock may include weakness, tachycardia, hyperventilation, sweating, anxiety, and increased thirst. This may be followed by confusion, unconsciousness, or cardiac arrest, as complications worsen.
Shock is divided into four main types based on the underlying cause: hypovolemic, cardiogenic, obstructive, and distributive shock. Hypovolemic shock, also known as low volume shock, may be from bleeding, diarrhea, or vomiting."
Open Hand Trauma,"Obvious history of hand trauma, skin laceration, bleeding, in severe cases, tendon exposure, associated fractures, missing fingers, and dysfunction in finger flexion and extension","A blunt trauma, also known as a blunt force trauma or non-penetrating trauma, is a physical trauma due to a forceful impact without penetration of the body's surface. Blunt trauma stands in contrast with penetrating trauma, which occurs when an object pierces the skin, enters body tissue, and creates an open wound. Blunt trauma occurs due to direct physical trauma or impactful force to a body part. Such incidents often occur with road traffic collisions, assaults, and sports-related injuries, and are notably common among the elderly who experience falls.
Blunt trauma can lead to a wide range of injuries including contusions, concussions, abrasions, lacerations, internal or external hemorrhages, and bone fractures."
Hepatitis G,"Poor appetite, nausea, discomfort in the upper right quadrant, pain, jaundice, liver enlargement, and tenderness in the liver area","Hepatitis E is inflammation of the liver caused by infection with the hepatitis E virus (HEV); it is a type of viral hepatitis. Hepatitis E has mainly a fecal-oral transmission route that is similar to hepatitis A, although the viruses are unrelated. HEV is a positive-sense, single-stranded, nonenveloped, RNA icosahedral virus and one of five known human hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E.
Like hepatitis A, hepatitis E usually follows an acute and self-limiting course of illness (the condition is temporary and the individual recovers) with low death rates in resource-rich areas; however, it can be more severe in pregnant women and people with a weakened immune system, with substantially higher death rates. In pregnant women, especially in the third trimester, the disease is more often severe and is associated with a clinical syndrome called fulminant liver failure, with death rates around 20%. Whereas pregnant women may have a rapid and severe course, organ transplant recipients who receive medications to weaken the immune system and prevent organ rejection can develop a slower and more persistent form called chronic hepatitis E, which is so diagnosed after 3 months of continuous viremia."
Traumatic Brain Injury,"Mood swings, lack of concentration, dizziness, fatigue, headache, insomnia, memory disorders","A traumatic brain injury (TBI), also known as an intracranial injury, is an injury to the brain caused by an external force. TBI can be classified based on severity ranging from mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI/concussion) to severe traumatic brain injury. TBI can also be characterized based on mechanism (closed or penetrating head injury) or other features (e.g., occurring in a specific location or over a widespread area). Head injury is a broader category that may involve damage to other structures such as the scalp and skull. TBI can result in physical, cognitive, social, emotional and behavioral symptoms, and outcomes can range from complete recovery to permanent disability or death."
Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome,"Abdominal pain, pigmented skin lesions, macules, polyps","PeutzJeghers syndrome (often abbreviated PJS) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the development of benign hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract and hyperpigmented macules on the lips and oral mucosa (melanosis). This syndrome can be classed as one of various hereditary intestinal polyposis syndromes and one of various hamartomatous polyposis syndromes. It has an incidence of approximately 1 in 25,000 to 300,000 births.


== Signs and symptoms ==
The risks associated with this syndrome include a substantial risk of cancer, especially of the breast  and gastrointestinal tracts. Colorectal is the most common malignancy, with a lifetime risk of 39 percent, followed by breast cancer in females with a lifetime risk of 32 to 54 percent."
Activated Protein C Resistance,Venous Thrombosis,"Activated protein C resistance (APCR) is a hypercoagulability (an increased tendency of the blood to clot) characterized by a lack of a response to activated protein C (APC), which normally helps prevent blood from clotting excessively. This results in an increased risk of venous thrombosis (blood clots in veins), which resulting in medical conditions such as deep vein thrombosis (usually in the leg) and pulmonary embolism (in the lung, which can cause death). The most common cause of hereditary APC resistance is factor V Leiden mutation.


== Presentation ==


=== Associated conditions ===
An estimated 64 percent of patients with venous thromboembolism may have APC resistance.


== Genetics ==
The disorder can be acquired or inherited, the hereditary form having an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern."
Gastric Cancer,"Decreased appetite, upper abdominal mass, pain, weight loss, cachexia, melena, anemia","Stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, is a malignant tumor of the stomach. It is a cancer that develops in the lining of the stomach. Most cases of stomach cancers are gastric carcinomas, which can be divided into a number of subtypes, including gastric adenocarcinomas. Lymphomas and mesenchymal tumors may also develop in the stomach. Early symptoms may include heartburn, upper abdominal pain, nausea, and loss of appetite."
Posterior Urethral Valve,"Difficulty urinating and urinary retention, micturition disorder, malnutrition, high fever, chills, pyuria, hematuria, renal failure, dehydration, urinary incontinence and enuresis, chronic renal failure, anemia","Posterior urethral valve (PUV) disorder is an obstructive developmental anomaly in the urethra and genitourinary system of male newborns. A posterior urethral valve is an obstructing membrane in the posterior male urethra as a result of abnormal in utero development. It is the most common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in male newborns. The disorder varies in degree, with mild cases presenting late due to milder symptoms. More severe cases can have renal and respiratory failure from lung underdevelopment as result of low amniotic fluid volumes, requiring intensive care and close monitoring."
Krabbe Disease,"Intellectual disability, lung infections, falls","Krabbe disease (KD) (also known as globoid cell leukodystrophy or galactosylceramide lipidosis) is a rare and often fatal lysosomal storage disease that results in progressive damage to the nervous system. KD involves dysfunctional metabolism of sphingolipids and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The disease is named after the Danish neurologist Knud Krabbe (18851961).


== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms in asymptomatic infantile-onset (<12 months after birth) and later-onset Krabbe disease present themselves differently. Of individuals with infantile-onset Krabbe disease, 8590% display progressive neurologic deterioration in infancy and death before the age of two."
Post-abdominoperineal Resection for Rectal Cancer with Pelvic Peritoneal Hernia,"Reduced stool quantity, stool column deformation and thinning, abdominal pain, pencil-thin stools, spastic hypertrophy of the puborectalis muscle, tenderness in the lateral abdominal wall or posterior lumbar region, palpable tender mass in the lower left abdomen, villous atrophy of the intestine, abdominal distension","Colectomy (col- + -ectomy) is the surgical removal of any extent of the colon, the longest portion of the large bowel. Colectomy may be performed for prophylactic, curative, or palliative reasons. Indications include cancer, infection, infarction, perforation, and impaired function of the colon. Colectomy may be performed open, laparoscopically, or robotically. Following removal of the bowel segment, the surgeon may restore continuity of the bowel or create a colostomy."
Gastrointestinal Syndrome,"Nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain with upper abdomen fullness and distension, sloshing sound, diffuse abdominal tenderness","Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), also known as radiation sickness or radiation poisoning, is a collection of health effects that are caused by being exposed to high amounts of ionizing radiation in a short period of time. Symptoms can start within an hour of exposure, and can last for several months. Early symptoms are usually nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite. In the following hours or weeks, initial symptoms may appear to improve, before the development of additional symptoms, after which either recovery or death follows.
ARS involves a total dose of greater than 0.7 Gy (70 rad), that generally occurs from a source outside the body, delivered within a few minutes."
Patellofemoral Chondromalacia,"Pain beneath the kneecap, pain behind the kneecap, poor cartilage development, significant pain during uphill and downhill movements","Chondromalacia patellae (also known as CMP) is an inflammation of the underside of the patella and softening of the cartilage.
The cartilage under the kneecap is a natural shock absorber, and overuse, injury, and many other factors can cause increased deterioration and breakdown of the cartilage. The cartilage is no longer smooth and therefore movement and use is very painful. While it often affects young individuals engaged in active sports, it also afflicts older adults who overwork their knees.
Chondromalacia patellae is sometimes used synonymously with patellofemoral pain syndrome."
Hemoptysis,"Chest and back pain, coughing up blood, accompanied by chills and fever, cough, vomiting, shortness of breath","Hemoptysis or haemoptysis is the discharge of blood or blood-stained mucus through the mouth coming from the bronchi, larynx, trachea, or lungs. It does not necessarily involve coughing. In other words, it is the airway bleeding. This can occur with lung cancer, infections such as tuberculosis, bronchitis, or pneumonia, and certain cardiovascular conditions. Hemoptysis is considered massive at 300 mL (11 imp fl oz; 10 US fl oz)."
Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia,"Hemolytic anemia, hemoglobinuria, jaundice, fever","Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) is a microangiopathic subgroup of hemolytic anemia (loss of red blood cells through destruction) caused by factors in the small blood vessels. It is identified by the finding of anemia and schistocytes on microscopy of the blood film.


== Signs and symptoms ==
In diseases such as hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and malignant hypertension, the endothelial layer of small vessels is damaged with resulting fibrin deposition and platelet aggregation.  As red blood cells travel through these damaged vessels, they are fragmented resulting in intravascular hemolysis. The resulting schistocytes (red cell fragments) are also increasingly targeted for destruction by the reticuloendothelial system in the spleen, due to their narrow passage through obstructed vessel lumina."
Esophageal Leiomyoma,"Nausea and vomiting, difficulty swallowing, loss of appetite, retching, belching, upper abdominal pain, feeling of fullness in the stomach, cough, and shortness of breath","A leiomyoma, also known as a fibroid, is a benign smooth muscle tumor that very rarely becomes cancer (0.1%). They can occur in any organ, but the most common forms occur in the uterus, small bowel, and the esophagus. Polycythemia may occur due to increased erythropoietin production as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome.
The word is from leio- + myo- + -oma, 'smooth-muscle tumor'. The plural form can be either the English leiomyomas or the classical leiomyomata."
Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome in Children,"Diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, hyperpigmentation of the skin, bloody stools, hair loss, pigmentary anomalies, anemia, paralytic ileus, hematemesis, pigmented skin lesions, mucosal damage","Gynecomastia (also spelled gynaecomastia) is the non-cancerous enlargement of one or both breasts in men due to the growth of breast tissue as a result of a hormone imbalance between estrogens and androgens. Physically speaking, gynecomastia is completely benign, but it is associated with significant psychological distress, social stigma, and dysphoria.
Gynecomastia can be normal in newborn male babies due to exposure to estrogen from the mother, in adolescent boys going through puberty, in older men over the age of 50, and in obese men. Most occurrences of gynecomastia do not require diagnostic tests. Gynecomastia may be caused by abnormal hormone changes, any condition that leads to an increase in the ratio of estrogens/androgens such as liver disease, kidney failure, thyroid disease and some non-breast tumors."
Pediatric Cerebral Contusion and Laceration,"Headache, nausea, vomiting, coma","Cerebral contusion (Latin: contusio cerebri), a form of traumatic brain injury, is a bruise of the brain tissue.  Like bruises in other tissues, cerebral contusion can be associated with multiple microhemorrhages, small blood vessel leaks into brain tissue. Contusion occurs in 2030% of severe head injuries. A cerebral laceration is a similar injury except that, according to their respective definitions, the pia-arachnoid membranes are torn over the site of injury in laceration and are not torn in contusion.  The injury can cause a decline in mental function in the long term and in the emergency setting may result in brain herniation, a life-threatening condition in which parts of the brain are squeezed past parts of the skull."
Anterior Spinal Artery Syndrome (Inferior),"Sensory disturbances, paralysis, urinary and fecal incontinence","Anterior spinal artery syndrome (also known as ""anterior spinal cord syndrome"") is syndrome caused by ischemia of the area supplied by the  anterior spinal artery, resulting in loss of function of the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord. The region affected includes the descending  corticospinal tract, ascending spinothalamic tract, and autonomic fibers. It is characterized by a corresponding loss of motor function, loss of pain and temperature sensation, and hypotension.
Anterior spinal artery syndrome is the most common form of spinal cord infarction. The anterior spinal cord is at increased risk for infarction because it is supplied by the single anterior spinal artery and has little collateral circulation, unlike the posterior spinal cord which is supplied by two posterior spinal arteries."
Acute Sedative-Hypnotic Drug Poisoning,"Drowsiness, clouded consciousness, cold and clammy skin, shock","A drug overdose (overdose or OD) is the ingestion or application of a drug or other substance in quantities much greater than are recommended. Typically the term is applied for cases when a risk to health is a potential result. An overdose may result in a toxic state or death.


== Classification ==
The word ""overdose"" implies that there is a common safe dosage and usage for the drug; therefore, the term is commonly applied only to drugs, not poisons, even though many poisons as well are harmless at a low enough dosage. Drug overdose is sometimes used as a means to commit suicide, as the result of intentional or unintentional misuse of medication."
Pancreatic Sarcoma,"In the early stages, there are often no symptoms. As the condition progresses, symptoms may include a mass in the upper abdomen, discomfort or dull pain in the upper abdomen, pain in the right flank or back, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss.","Ras, from ""Rat sarcoma virus"", is a family of related proteins that are expressed in all animal cell lineages and organs. All Ras protein family members belong to a class of protein called small GTPase, and are involved in transmitting signals within cells (cellular signal transduction). Ras is the prototypical member of the Ras superfamily of proteins, which are all related in three-dimensional structure and regulate diverse cell behaviours.
When Ras is 'switched on' by incoming signals, it subsequently switches on other proteins, which ultimately turn on genes involved in cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Mutations in Ras genes can lead to the production of permanently activated Ras proteins, which can cause unintended and overactive signaling inside the cell, even in the absence of incoming signals."
Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,"headache and projectile vomiting, disturbance of consciousness, mental disorder, pale complexion, cold sweat, spasm of the neck extensor muscles, motor disorder","Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is bleeding into the subarachnoid spacethe area between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain. Symptoms may include a severe headache of rapid onset, vomiting, decreased level of consciousness, fever, weakness, numbness, and sometimes seizures. Neck stiffness or neck pain are also relatively common. In about a quarter of people a small bleed with resolving symptoms occurs within a month of a larger bleed.
SAH may occur as a result of a head injury or spontaneously, usually from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm."
Brain Herniation,"Severe headache, vomiting, opisthotonus, decerebrate rigidity, brainstem damage signs, significant blood pressure fluctuations, abnormal breathing, flushed face, sweating abnormalities, pallor, anhidrosis, cardiac arrest, neck stiffness, neck pain","Brain herniation is a potentially deadly side effect of very high pressure within the skull that occurs when a part of the brain is squeezed across structures within the skull. The brain can shift across such structures as the falx cerebri, the tentorium cerebelli, and even through the foramen magnum (the hole in the base of the skull through which the spinal cord connects with the brain).  Herniation can be caused by a number of factors that cause a mass effect and increase intracranial pressure (ICP): these include traumatic brain injury, intracranial hemorrhage, or brain tumor.
Herniation can also occur in the absence of high ICP when mass lesions such as hematomas occur at the borders of brain compartments. In such cases local pressure is increased at the place where the herniation occurs, but this pressure is not transmitted to the rest of the brain, and therefore does not register as an increase in ICP.
Because herniation puts extreme pressure on parts of the brain and thereby cuts off the blood supply to various parts of the brain, it is often fatal."
Ulnar Nerve Palsy,"Limitation in the separation and merging movements of the fingers, with loss of movement in the little finger.","The ulnar nerve is a nerve that runs near the ulna, one of the two long bones in the forearm. The ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint is in relation with the ulnar nerve. The nerve is the largest in the human body unprotected by muscle or bone, so injury is common. This nerve is directly connected to the little finger, and the adjacent half of the ring finger, innervating the palmar aspect of these fingers, including both front and back of the tips, perhaps as far back as the fingernail beds.
This nerve can cause an electric shock-like sensation by striking the medial epicondyle of the humerus posteriorly, or inferiorly with the elbow flexed."
Food Allergy and Intolerance,"Lactose Intolerance, Hereditary Fructose Intolerance, Infantile Anorexia","A food allergy is an abnormal immune response to food. The symptoms of the allergic reaction may range from mild to severe. They may include itchiness, swelling of the tongue, vomiting, diarrhea, hives, trouble breathing, or low blood pressure. This typically occurs within minutes to several hours of exposure. When the symptoms are severe, it is known as anaphylaxis."
Apraxia,Apraxia Syndrome,"Aphasia, also known as dysphasia, is an impairment in a person's ability to comprehend or formulate language because of damage to specific brain regions. The major causes are stroke and head trauma; prevalence is hard to determine, but aphasia due to stroke is estimated to be 0.10.4% in developed countries. Aphasia can also be the result of brain tumors, epilepsy, autoimmune neurological diseases, brain infections, or neurodegenerative diseases (such as dementias).
To be diagnosed with aphasia, a person's language must be significantly impaired in one or more of the four aspects of communication. In the case of progressive aphasia, a noticeable decline in language abilities over a short period of time is required."
Pancreatic Pseudocyst,"Abdominal pain, transverse colon displacement, nausea and vomiting, consumptive weight loss","A pancreatic pseudocyst is a circumscribed collection of fluid rich in pancreatic enzymes, blood, and non-necrotic tissue, typically located in the lesser sac of the abdomen. Pancreatic pseudocysts are usually complications of pancreatitis, although in children they frequently occur following abdominal trauma. Pancreatic pseudocysts account for approximately 75% of all pancreatic masses.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms of pancreatic pseudocyst include abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting and lack of appetite.


=== Complications ===
Complications of pancreatic pseudocysts include infection, hemorrhage, obstruction of nearby hollow structures, and rupture."
Bone Metastatic Malignant Tumors,"Bone pain, fever, numbness in the extremities","Metastasis is a pathogenic agent's spreading from an initial or primary site to a different or secondary site within the host's body; the term is typically used when referring to metastasis by a cancerous tumor.  The newly pathological sites, then, are metastases (mets). It is generally distinguished from cancer invasion, which is the direct extension and penetration by cancer cells into neighboring tissues.
Cancer occurs after cells are genetically altered to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. This uncontrolled proliferation by mitosis produces a primary heterogeneic tumour."
Anhydrosis,"Absence of tears, reduced tearing","Hypohidrosis is a medical condition in which a person exhibits diminished sweating in response to appropriate stimuli. In contrast with hyperhidrosis, which is a socially troubling yet often benign condition, the consequences of untreated hypohidrosis include hyperthermia, heat stroke and death. An extreme case of hypohidrosis in which there is a complete absence of sweating and the skin is dry is termed anhidrosis. The condition is also known as adiaphoresis, ischidrosis, oligidria, oligohidrosis and sweating deficiency.


== Causes ==
The causes are the following:


== Diagnosis ==
Sweat is readily visualized by a topical indicator such as iodinated starch (Minor test) or sodium alizarin sulphonate, both of which undergo a dramatic colour change when moistened by sweat."
Cherry Hemangioma,"Capillary dilation, red skin spots","Cherry angioma, also called cherry hemangioma or Campbell de Morgan Spot, is a small bright red dome-shaped bump on the skin. It ranges between 0.5 and 6 mm in diameter and usually several are present, typically on the chest and arms, and increasing in number with age. If scratched, they may bleed.
They are a harmless benign tumour, containing an abnormal proliferation of blood vessels, and have no relationship to cancer. They are the most common kind of angioma, and increase with age, occurring in nearly all adults over 30 years."
Obesity Cardiomyopathy,"Orthopnea, Dyspnea, Sudden death, Abdominal distension, Obesity, Somnolence, Mental languor, Self-orientation disorder, Lower extremity edema, Exertional dyspnea","Cardiomyopathy is a group of primary diseases of the heart muscle. Early on there may be few or no symptoms. As the disease worsens, shortness of breath, feeling tired, and swelling of the legs may occur, due to the onset of heart failure. An irregular heart beat and fainting may occur. Those affected are at an increased risk of sudden cardiac death."
Eosinophilic Myalgia Syndrome,"Low-grade fever, fatigue, difficulty breathing, cough, joint pain, rash, myalgia, muscle cramps, memory impairment, lack of concentration, respiratory failure","Eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome is a rare, sometimes fatal neurological condition linked to the ingestion of the dietary supplement L-tryptophan. The risk of developing EMS increases with larger doses of tryptophan and increasing age. Some research suggests that certain genetic polymorphisms may be related to the development of EMS. The presence of eosinophilia is a core feature of EMS, along with unusually severe myalgia (muscle pain).


== Signs and symptoms ==
The initial, acute phase of EMS, which last for three to six months, presents as trouble with breathing and muscle problems, including soreness and spasm, but which may also be intense. Muscle weakness is not a feature of this phase, but some people experience muscle stiffness."
Chronic Renal Failure,"Loss of appetite, vomiting, weakness, deep and long breathing","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a type of long-term kidney disease, defined by the sustained presence of abnormal kidney function and/or abnormal kidney structure. To meet criteria for CKD, the abnormalities must be present for at least three months. Early in the course of CKD, patients are usually asymptomatic, but later symptoms may include leg swelling, feeling tired, vomiting, loss of appetite, and confusion. Complications can relate to hormonal dysfunction of the kidneys and include (in chronological order) high blood pressure (often related to activation of the reninangiotensin system), bone disease, and anemia. Additionally CKD patients have markedly increased cardiovascular complications with increased risks of death and hospitalization."
Fetal Demise,"Absence of fetal movement, vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain","Stillbirth is typically defined as fetal death at or after 20 or 28 weeks of pregnancy, depending on the source.:Overview tab, It results in a baby born without signs of life. A stillbirth can often result in the feeling of guilt or grief in the mother. The term is in contrast to miscarriage, which is an early pregnancy loss, and sudden infant death syndrome, where the baby dies a short time after being born alive.
Often the cause is unknown. Causes may include pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia and birth complications, problems with the placenta or umbilical cord, birth defects, infections such as malaria and syphilis, and poor health in the mother.:Causes tab, Risk factors include a mother's age over 35, smoking, drug use, use of assisted reproductive technology, and first pregnancy."
Granulosa Cell Tumor,"Unexplained fever, reduced immunity, weight loss","Granulosa cell tumours are tumours that arise from granulosa cells. They are estrogen-secreting tumours and present as large, complex, ovarian masses. These tumours are part of the sex cordgonadal stromal tumour or non-epithelial group of tumours. Although granulosa cells normally occur only in the ovary, granulosa cell tumours occur in both ovaries and testicles (see ovarian cancer and testicular cancer). These tumours should be considered malignant and treated in the same way as other malignant tumours of ovary."
Viral Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,"Nasal congestion, sneezing, cough","An upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is an illness caused by an acute infection, which involves the upper respiratory tract, including the nose, sinuses, pharynx, larynx or trachea. This commonly includes nasal obstruction, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, sinusitis, otitis media, and the common cold.:28 Most infections are viral in nature, and in other instances, the cause is bacterial. URTIs can also be fungal or helminthic in origin, but these are less common.:443445
In 2015, 17.2 billion cases of URTIs are estimated to have occurred. As of 2016, they caused about 3,000 deaths, down from 4,000 in 1990.


== Signs and symptoms ==

In uncomplicated colds, coughing and nasal discharge may persist for 14 days or more even after other symptoms have resolved."
Salicylate Poisoning in Children,"Nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, pallor, cyanosis of the lips, headache, respiratory failure, visual disturbances, hallucinations, pink frothy sputum, hematemesis and melena, seizures","Salicylate poisoning, also known as aspirin poisoning, is the acute or chronic poisoning with a salicylate such as aspirin. The classic symptoms are ringing in the ears, nausea, abdominal pain, and a fast breathing rate. Early on, these may be subtle, while larger doses may result in fever. Complications can include swelling of the brain or lungs, seizures, low blood sugar, or cardiac arrest.
While usually due to aspirin, other possible causes include oil of wintergreen and bismuth subsalicylate."
Cerebral Schistosomiasis,"Convulsions, disturbances of consciousness, infectious fever, paralysis, meningeal irritation signs, neuralgia, headache, epilepsy and epileptiform seizures, sensory disturbances, lymphadenopathy, facial muscle twitching, ataxia","Schistosomiasis, also known as snail fever, bilharzia, and Katayama fever is a disease caused by parasitic flatworms called schistosomes. It affects the urinary tract or the intestines. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, or blood in the urine. Those who have been infected for a long time may experience liver damage, kidney failure, infertility, or bladder cancer. In children, schistosomiasis may cause poor growth and learning difficulties."
Solitary Kidney,"Asymptomatic, physical examination reveals the absence of one kidney","A nephrectomy is the surgical removal of a kidney, performed to treat a number of kidney diseases including kidney cancer. It is also done to remove a normal healthy kidney from a living or deceased donor, which is part of a kidney transplant procedure.


== History ==
The first recorded nephrectomy was performed in 1861 by Erastus B. Wolcott in Wisconsin. The patient had had a large tumor and the operation was initially successful, but the patient died fifteen days later. The first planned nephrectomy was performed by the German surgeon Gustav Simon on August 2, 1869, in Heidelberg."
Orbital Tumor,"A firm mass often palpable in the superomedial orbit, decreased vision, conjunctival congestion, and pain","An eye neoplasm is a tumor of the eye. A rare type of tumor, eye neoplasms can affect all parts of the eye, and can either be benign or malignant (cancerous), in which case it is known as eye cancer. Eye cancers can be primary (starts within the eye) or metastatic cancer (spread to the eye from another organ). The two most common cancers that spread to the eye from another organ are breast cancer and lung cancer. Other less common sites of origin include the prostate, kidney, thyroid, skin, colon and blood or bone marrow."
Orbital Hemangiopericytoma,"Periorbital bruising, eyelid swelling with a pale green hue, homonymous hemianopsia, exophthalmos, and inability of voluntary eye movement.","Dr. Vijay Anand Reddy (born 20 October 1959) is an Indian oncologist known for his contributions to the field of cancer. He serves as the director and senior consultant oncologist at Apollo Cancer Hospital, Hyderabad. He also served as the President of Association of Radiation Oncologists of India & Chairman of Indian College of Radiation Oncology.


== Life and career ==
Reddy was born in the Hyderabad city in Telangana state."
Chronic Pancreatitis in Children,"Abdominal pain, malabsorption, and poor growth","Chronic pancreatitis is a long-standing inflammation of the pancreas that alters the organ's normal structure and functions. It can present as episodes of acute inflammation in a previously injured pancreas, or as chronic damage with persistent pain or malabsorption. It is a disease process characterized by irreversible damage to the pancreas as distinct from reversible changes in acute pancreatitis. Tobacco smoke and alcohol misuse are two of the most frequently implicated causes, and the two risk factors are thought to have a synergistic effect with regards to the development of chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is a risk factor for the development of pancreatic cancer."
Neurogenic Tumors,"Cough, hoarseness, numbness of limbs or trunk, difficulty swallowing, chest tightness, shortness of breath","A mediastinal tumor is a tumor in the mediastinum, the cavity that separates the lungs from the rest of the chest. It contains the heart, esophagus, trachea, thymus, and aorta. The most common mediastinal masses are thymoma (20% of mediastinal tumors), usually found in the anterior mediastinum, followed by neurogenic Timor (1520%) located in the anterior mediastinum. Lung cancer typically spreads to the lymph nodes in the mediastinum.
The mediastinum has three main  parts: the anterior mediastinum (front), the middle mediastinum, and the posterior mediastinum (back)."
Hereditary Hemochromatosis,"Fatigue, hepatomegaly, hyperpigmentation, diabetes","Hereditary haemochromatosis type 1 (HFE-related haemochromatosis) is a genetic disorder characterized by excessive intestinal absorption of dietary iron, resulting in a pathological increase in total body iron stores. Humans, like most animals, have no mechanism to regulate excess iron, simply losing a limited amount through various means like sweating or menstruating.
Excess iron accumulates in tissues and organs, disrupting their normal function. The most susceptible organs include the liver, heart, pancreas, skin, joints, gonads, thyroid and pituitary gland; patients can present with cirrhosis, polyarthropathy, hypogonadism, heart failure, or diabetes.
There are five types of hereditary hemochromatosis: type 1, 2 (2A, 2B), 3, 4 and 5, all caused by mutated genes."
Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma,"Upper abdominal discomfort, progressive jaundice, anorexia, emaciation, pruritus, weight loss, hepatomegaly","Cholangiocarcinoma, also known as bile duct cancer, is a type of cancer that forms in the bile ducts. Symptoms of cholangiocarcinoma may include abdominal pain, yellowish skin, weight loss, generalized itching, and fever. Light colored stool or dark urine may also occur. Other biliary tract cancers include gallbladder cancer and cancer of the ampulla of Vater.
Risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma include primary sclerosing cholangitis (an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts), ulcerative colitis, cirrhosis, hepatitis C, hepatitis B, infection with certain liver flukes, and some congenital liver malformations."
Breast Paget's Disease,"Breast pain, breast eczema, skin ulceration","Paget's disease of the breast (also known as mammary Paget's disease) is a rare skin change at the nipple nearly always associated with underlying breast cancer. Paget's disease of the breast was first described by Sir James Paget in 1874. The condition is an uncommon disease accounting for 1 to 4% of all breast cancers cases. 92% to 100% of patients with Paget's disease of the breast have an underlying breast cancer.
The condition in itself often appears innocuous, limited to a surface appearance and it is sometimes dismissed, although it is actually indicative of underlying breast cancer."
Laryngeal Keratosis,"Foreign body sensation, itching, hoarseness","Warts are non-cancerous viral growths usually occurring on the hands and feet but which can also affect other locations, such as the genitals or face. One or many warts may appear. They are distinguished from cancerous tumors as they are caused by a viral infection, such as a human papillomavirus,  rather than a cancer growth.
Factors that increase the risk include the use of public showers and pools, working with meat, eczema, and a weak immune system. The virus is believed to infect the host through the entrance of a skin wound."
Vaginal Metastatic Tumors,"Vaginal bleeding, increased vaginal discharge","Vaginal cancer is an extraordinarily rare form of cancer that develops in the tissue of the vagina. Primary vaginal cancer originates from the vaginal tissue  most frequently squamous cell carcinoma, but primary vaginal adenocarcinoma, sarcoma, and melanoma have also been reported  while secondary vaginal cancer involves the metastasis of a cancer that originated in a different part of the body. Secondary vaginal cancer is more common. Signs of vaginal cancer may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, dysuria, tenesmus, or pelvic pain, though as many as 20% of women diagnosed with vaginal cancer are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Vaginal cancer occurs more frequently in women over age 50, and the mean age of diagnosis of vaginal cancer is 60 years."
Pediatric Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome,"Hydrocephalus, Cryptorchidism, Jaw cysts","Nevus (pl.: nevi) is a nonspecific medical term for a visible, circumscribed, chronic lesion of the skin or mucosa. The term originates from nvus, which is Latin for ""birthmark""; however, a nevus can be either congenital (present at birth) or acquired. Common terms, including mole, birthmark, and beauty mark, are used to describe nevi, but these terms do not distinguish specific types of nevi from one another.


== Classification ==
The term nevus is applied to a number of conditions caused by neoplasias and hyperplasias of melanocytes, as well as a number of pigmentation disorders, both hypermelanotic (containing increased melanin, the pigment responsible for skin color) and hypomelanotic (containing decreased melanin). Suspicious skin moles which are multi-colored or pink may be a finding in skin cancer."
Internal Injury Fever,"Imbalance of Yin and Yang, Qi and Blood, persistent fever, low-grade fever, qi and blood deficiency, high fever, dysfunction of the viscera, five-centers restlessness heat, dizziness, fatigue, spontaneous sweating","Internal bleeding (also called internal haemorrhage) is a loss of blood from a blood vessel that collects inside the body, and is not usually visible from the outside. It can be a serious medical emergency but the extent of severity depends on bleeding rate and location of the bleeding (e.g. head, torso, extremities). Severe internal bleeding into the chest, abdomen, pelvis, or thighs can cause hemorrhagic shock or death if proper medical treatment is not received quickly. Internal bleeding is a medical emergency and should be treated immediately by medical professionals."
Summer-heat Syndrome,"Fatigue and lethargy, lack of strength and excessive sleepiness, dizziness and heavy sweating, irritability and thirst, dull appetite, and weight loss.","Hyperthermia, also known simply as overheating, is a condition in which an individual's body temperature is elevated beyond normal due to failed thermoregulation. The person's body produces or absorbs more heat than it dissipates. When extreme temperature elevation occurs, it becomes a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment to prevent disability or death. Almost half a million deaths are recorded every year from hyperthermia.
The most common causes include heat stroke and adverse reactions to drugs."
Gynecomastia in Men,"Breast pain, breast enlargement, breast hardening, enlarged male breasts, nipple discharge, mammary gland enlargement","Gynecomastia (also spelled gynaecomastia) is the non-cancerous enlargement of one or both breasts in men due to the growth of breast tissue as a result of a hormone imbalance between estrogens and androgens. Physically speaking, gynecomastia is completely benign, but it is associated with significant psychological distress, social stigma, and dysphoria.
Gynecomastia can be normal in newborn male babies due to exposure to estrogen from the mother, in adolescent boys going through puberty, in older men over the age of 50, and in obese men. Most occurrences of gynecomastia do not require diagnostic tests. Gynecomastia may be caused by abnormal hormone changes, any condition that leads to an increase in the ratio of estrogens/androgens such as liver disease, kidney failure, thyroid disease and some non-breast tumors."
Flaccid Paralysis,"Laxity of sinews and channels, weakness of limb muscles, inability to move at will, and even muscle atrophy or paralysis","Flaccid paralysis is a neurological condition characterized by weakness or paralysis and reduced muscle tone without other obvious cause (e.g., trauma). This abnormal condition may be caused by disease or by trauma affecting the nerves associated with the involved muscles.  For example, if the somatic nerves to a skeletal muscle are severed, then the muscle will exhibit flaccid paralysis.  When muscles enter this state, they become limp and cannot contract.  This condition can become fatal if it affects the respiratory muscles, posing the threat of suffocation."
Meningococcal Meningitis,"Chills, high fever, headache, vomiting, bulging fontanelles, signs of meningeal irritation, brain abscess, fever, petechiae, irregular breathing, nausea and vomiting, neck stiffness","Meningococcal disease is a serious infection caused by Neisseria meningitidis, also known  as meningococcus, a gram negative diplococcus. Meningococcal disease includes meningitis,  meningococcal septicemia, or a combination of both, which can be life-threatening and rapidly progressive. If left untreated, the disease has a high mortality rate; however, it is preventable through vaccination. Meningitis and meningococcal sepsis are major causes of illness, death, and disability in both developed and under-developed countries.
Meningococcal disease can be transmitted to others through saliva, close contact with an infected individual by inhaling respiratory air droplets."
Pilar Cyst,"Cystic nodules on the scalp, mostly solitary, more common in females","A trichilemmal cyst (or pilar cyst) is a common cyst that forms from a hair follicle, most often on the scalp, and is smooth, mobile, and filled with keratin, a protein component found in hair, nails, skin, and horns. Trichilemmal cysts are clinically and histologically distinct from trichilemmal horns, hard tissue that is much rarer and not limited to the scalp. Rarely, these cysts may grow more extensively and form rapidly multiplying trichilemmal tumors, also called proliferating trichilemmal cysts, which are benign, but may grow aggressively at the cyst site. Very rarely, trichilemmal cysts can become cancerous.


== Classification ==
Trichilemmal cysts may be classified as sebaceous cysts, although technically speaking are not sebaceous."
Secondary Glaucoma with Iris and Ciliary Body Inflammation,"Headache, nausea and vomiting, blurred vision, rainbow vision","Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can lead to damage of the optic nerve. The optic nerve transmits visual information from the eye to the brain. Glaucoma may cause vision loss if left untreated. It has been called the ""silent thief of sight"" because the loss of vision usually occurs slowly over a long period of time. A major risk factor for glaucoma is increased pressure within the eye, known as intraocular pressure (IOP)."
Status Asthmaticus,"Shortness of breath, tachycardia, wheezing, disturbance of consciousness, hypotension, tracheal tug, excessive sweating, and mouth breathing","Acute severe asthma, also known as status asthmaticus, is an acute exacerbation of asthma that does not respond to standard treatments of bronchodilators (inhalers) and corticosteroids. Asthma is caused by multiple genes, some having protective effect, with each gene having its own tendency to be influenced by the environment although a genetic link leading to acute severe asthma is still unknown. Symptoms include chest tightness, rapidly progressive dyspnea (shortness of breath), dry cough, use of accessory respiratory muscles, fast and/or labored breathing, and extreme wheezing. It is a life-threatening episode of airway obstruction and is considered a medical emergency. Complications include cardiac and/or respiratory arrest."
Lung Cancer in the Elderly,"Cough, expectoration, hemoptysis, fever, rhonchus, lymphadenopathy, hemoptysis, chest tightness, hoarseness","Limited-stage small cell lung carcinoma (LS-SCLC) is a type of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) that is confined to an area which is small enough to be encompassed within a radiation portal. This generally includes cancer to one side of the lung and those might have reached the lymph nodes on the same side of the lung. 33% patients with small cell lung cancer are diagnosed with limited-stage small cell lung carcinoma when it is first found.  Common symptoms include but are not limited to persistent cough, chest pain, rust-coloured sputum, shortness of breath, fatigue, weight loss, wheezing, hoarseness and recurrent respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia and bronchitis. Nervous system problems, Cushing syndrome and SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone) can also be associated with small cell lung cancer."
Bladder Cough,"Cough, urinary incontinence, bladder dysfunction, mega bladder","A cough is a sudden expulsion of air through the large breathing passages which can help clear them of fluids, irritants, foreign particles and microbes. As a protective reflex, coughing can be repetitive with the cough reflex following three phases: an inhalation, a forced exhalation against a closed glottis, and a violent release of air from the lungs following opening of the glottis, usually accompanied by a distinctive sound.
Frequent coughing usually indicates the presence of a disease. Many viruses and bacteria benefit, from an evolutionary perspective, by causing the host to cough, which helps to spread the disease to new hosts. Irregular coughing is usually caused by a respiratory tract infection but can also be triggered by choking, smoking, air pollution, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, post-nasal drip, chronic bronchitis, lung tumors, heart failure and medications such as angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and beta blockers."
Secondary Myelofibrosis,"Fatigue, fever, weight loss, anemia, weakness, night sweats, palpitations, pallor, dyspnea, abdominal pain, abdominal mass, bone pain, jaundice","Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a rare bone marrow blood cancer. It is classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm, a group of cancers in which there is activation and growth of mutated cells in the bone marrow. This is most often associated with a somatic mutation in the JAK2, CALR, or MPL genes. In PMF, the bony aspects of bone marrow are remodeled in a process called osteosclerosis; in addition, fibroblasts secrete collagen and reticulin proteins that are collectively referred to as fibrosis. These two pathological processes compromise the normal function of bone marrow, resulting in decreased production of blood cells such as erythrocytes (red cells), granulocytes, and megakaryocytes."
Acute Stress Reaction,"Stupor, consciousness disorder, clouding of consciousness, disorientation, speaking in monosyllables or disconnected phrases, tense expression, disorganized movements, restlessness, impulsive destructive behavior, sitting or lying down immobile","Acute stress reaction (ASR), also known as psychological shock, mental shock, or simply shock, as well as acute stress disorder (ASD), is a psychological response to a terrifying, traumatic, or surprising experience. The reactions may include but are not limited to intrusive thoughts, or dissociation, and reactivity symptoms such as avoidance or hyperarousal. It may be exhibited for days or weeks after the traumatic event. If the condition is not correctly addressed, it may develop into post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).


== Diagnosis ==
The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) treats this condition differently from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)."
Synovial Sarcoma,"Pain in the buttocks, shoulder girdle, upper limbs, ankle joints, hip joints, shoulder joints, swelling of the dorsum of the foot at the ankle joint, lateral swelling and tenderness of the hip","A synovial sarcoma (also known as malignant synovioma) is a rare form of cancer which occurs primarily in the extremities of the arms or legs, often in proximity to joint capsules and tendon sheaths. It is a type of soft-tissue sarcoma.
The name ""synovial sarcoma"" was coined early in the 20th century, as some researchers thought that the microscopic similarity of some tumors to synovium, and its propensity to arise adjacent to joints, indicated a synovial origin; however, the actual cells from which the tumor develops are unknown and not necessarily synovial.
Primary synovial sarcomas are most common in the soft tissue near the large joints of the arm and leg but have been documented in most human tissues and organs, including the brain, prostate, and heart.
Synovial sarcoma occurs in about 12 per 1,000,000 people a year."
Wasting Syndrome,"Excessive thirst and hunger, ability to eat but losing weight","Cachexia () is a syndrome that happens when people have certain illnesses, causing muscle loss that cannot be fully reversed with improved nutrition. It is most common in diseases like cancer, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, and AIDS.  These conditions change how the body handles inflammation, metabolism, and brain signaling, leading to muscle loss and other harmful changes to body composition over time. Unlike weight loss from not eating enough, cachexia mainly affects muscle and can happen with or without fat loss. Diagnosis of cachexia is difficult because there are no clear guidelines, and its occurrence varies from one affected person to the next.
Like malnutrition, cachexia can lead to worse health outcomes and lower quality of life."
Mesenchymal Chondrosarcoma,"Persistent pain, swelling, lumps, and joint stiffness lasting months to years","A bone sarcoma is a primary  malignant bone tumour, a type of sarcoma that starts in the bones. This is in contrast to most bone cancers that are  secondary having developed as a metastasis from another cancer. Bone sarcomas are rare, and mostly affect the legs. The other type of sarcoma is a soft-tissue sarcoma.
There are three main types of bone sarcoma based on tissue type  an osteosarcoma, a Ewing's sarcoma, and a chondrosarcoma."
Chronic Heart Failure,"Post-activity shortness of breath, exertional dyspnea, hepatomegaly, lower limb edema, cardiac failure, coma, shock, abnormal breathing, arrhythmia, syncope, vertigo","Heart failure (HF), also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), is a syndrome caused by an impairment in the heart's ability to fill with and pump blood.
Although symptoms vary based on which side of the heart is affected, HF typically presents with shortness of breath, excessive fatigue, and bilateral leg swelling. The severity of the heart failure is mainly decided based on ejection fraction and also measured by the severity of symptoms. Other conditions that have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver disease, anemia, and thyroid disease.
Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excessive alcohol consumption, infection, and cardiomyopathy."
Splenic Rupture,"Shock, abdominal pain, internal bleeding, signs of peritoneal irritation, upper left abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, abdominal muscle tension, referred shoulder pain","A splenic injury, which includes a ruptured spleen, is any injury to the spleen. The rupture of a normal spleen can be caused by trauma, such as a traffic collision.


== Signs and symptoms ==
In minor injuries with little bleeding, there may be abdominal pain, tenderness in the epigastrium and pain in the left flank. Often there is a sharp pain in the left shoulder, known as Kehr's sign. In larger injuries with more extensive bleeding, signs of hypovolemic shock are most prominent."
Lymphatic Metastasis Cancer,"Anemia, Leukopenia, Thrombocytopenia, Bone Pain","Metastasis is a pathogenic agent's spreading from an initial or primary site to a different or secondary site within the host's body; the term is typically used when referring to metastasis by a cancerous tumor.  The newly pathological sites, then, are metastases (mets). It is generally distinguished from cancer invasion, which is the direct extension and penetration by cancer cells into neighboring tissues.
Cancer occurs after cells are genetically altered to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. This uncontrolled proliferation by mitosis produces a primary heterogeneic tumour."
Fuchs Heterochromic Iridocyclitis,"Blurred vision, floaters, decreased visual acuity, posterior corneal precipitates","Fuchs heterochromic iridocyclitis (FHI) is a chronic unilateral uveitis appearing with the triad of heterochromia, predisposition to cataract and glaucoma, and keratitic precipitates on the posterior corneal surface. Patients are often asymptomatic and the disease is often discovered through investigation of the cause of the heterochromia or cataract. Neovascularisation (growth of new abnormal vessels) is possible and any eye surgery, such as cataract surgery, can cause bleeding from the fragile vessels in the atrophic iris causing accumulation of blood in the anterior chamber of the eye, also known as hyphema.


== Presentation ==
This condition is usually unilateral, and its symptoms vary from none to mild blurring and discomfort. Signs include diffuse iris atrophy and small white keratic precipitates (deposits on the inner surface of the cornea), cells presenting in the anterior chamber as well as the anterior vitreous."
Cutaneous Lymphoid Granulomatosis,"Ulcers, itching, emaciation, fatigue, loss of appetite, low-grade fever, night sweats, cough, and dyspnea","Tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues (American English) or tumours of the haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues (British English) are tumors that affect the blood, bone marrow, lymph, and lymphatic system. Because these tissues are all intimately connected through both the circulatory system and the immune system, a disease affecting one will often affect the others as well, making aplasia, myeloproliferation and lymphoproliferation (and thus the leukemias, myelomas, and the lymphomas) closely related and often overlapping problems.
While uncommon in solid tumors, chromosomal translocations are a common cause of these diseases. This commonly leads to a different approach in diagnosis and treatment of hematological malignancies.
Hematological malignancies are malignant neoplasms (""cancer""), and they are generally treated by specialists in hematology and/or oncology."
Breast Hamartoma,"Presence of a mass in the breast, the tumor is round or oval, encapsulated, with a soft and uneven texture, and it grows slowly.","A hamartoma is a mostly benign, local malformation of cells that resembles a neoplasm of local tissue but is usually due to an overgrowth of multiple aberrant cells, with a basis in a systemic genetic condition, rather than a growth descended from a single mutated cell (monoclonality), as would typically define a benign neoplasm/tumor. Despite this, many hamartomas are found to have clonal chromosomal aberrations that are acquired through somatic mutations, and on this basis the term hamartoma is sometimes considered synonymous with neoplasm. Hamartomas are by definition benign, slow-growing or self-limiting, though the underlying condition may still predispose the individual towards malignancies.
Hamartomas are usually caused by a genetic syndrome that affects the development cycle of all or at least multiple cells. Many of these conditions are classified as overgrowth syndromes or cancer syndromes."
Pediatric Drug Rash,"Erythema, low fever, vomiting","Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms or drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), also termed drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS), is a rare reaction to certain medications. It involves primarily a widespread skin rash, fever, swollen lymph nodes, and characteristic blood abnormalities such as an abnormally high level of eosinophils, low number of platelets, and increased number of atypical white blood cells (lymphocytes). However, DRESS is often complicated by potentially life-threatening inflammation of internal organs and the syndrome has about a 10% mortality rate. Treatment consists of stopping the offending medication and providing supportive care. Systemic corticosteroids are commonly used as well but no controlled clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of this treatment."
Penile Cancer,"Superficial penile ulcers, inguinal lymphadenopathy, penile anomaly, penile pain, fever, ulceration","Penile cancer, or penile carcinoma, is a cancer that develops in the skin or tissues of the penis. Symptoms may include abnormal growth, an ulcer or sore on the skin of the penis, and bleeding or foul smelling discharge.
Risk factors include phimosis (inability to retract foreskin of the penis), chronic inflammation, smoking, HPV infection, condylomata acuminate, having multiple sexual partners, and early age of sexual intercourse.
Around 95% of penile cancers are squamous-cell carcinomas. Other types of penile cancer such as Merkel-cell carcinoma, small-cell carcinoma, and melanoma are generally rare."
Oral Leukoplakia,"Inflammatory cell infiltration, pale and swollen tongue, root of the tongue abscess, white patches, erosion, pain","Oral leukoplakia is a potentially malignant disorder affecting the oral mucosa. It is defined as ""essentially an oral mucosal white/gray lesion that cannot be considered as any other definable lesion."" Oral leukoplakia is a gray patch or plaque that develops in the oral cavity and is strongly associated with smoking. Leukoplakia is a firmly attached white patch on a mucous membrane which is associated with increased risk of cancer. The edges of the lesion are typically abrupt and the lesion changes with time. Advanced forms may develop red patches."
Pulmonary Aspergillosis,"Cough with phlegm, cough, dyspnea, fever, weight loss, hemoptysis, coma, anorexia, chest tightness, convulsion","Aspergillosis is a fungal infection of usually the lungs, caused by the genus Aspergillus, a common mold that is breathed in frequently from the air, but does not usually affect most people. It generally occurs in people with lung diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis or tuberculosis, or those who are immunocompromised such as those who have had a stem cell or organ transplant or those who take medications such as steroids and some cancer treatments which suppress the immune system. Rarely, it can affect skin.
Aspergillosis occurs in humans, birds and other animals. Aspergillosis occurs in chronic or acute forms which are clinically very distinct."
Hodgkin's Lymphoma,"Night sweats, low-grade fever, nausea, abdominal pain, dry cough, high fever, herpes, itchy skin","Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a type of lymphoma in which cancer originates from a specific type of white blood cell called lymphocytes, where multinucleated ReedSternberg cells (RS cells) are present in the lymph nodes. The condition was named after the English physician Thomas Hodgkin, who first described it in 1832. Symptoms may include fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Often, non-painful enlarged lymph nodes occur in the neck, under the arm, or in the groin. Persons affected may feel tired or be itchy."
Crush Syndrome,"Crush injury, skin indentation, circulatory congestion, increased skin turgor, dizziness, general malaise, respiratory failure, anemia, dizziness, hematoma, abdominal pain, acute renal failure","Crush syndrome (also traumatic rhabdomyolysis or Bywaters' syndrome) is a medical condition characterized by major shock and kidney failure after a crushing injury to skeletal muscle. It should not be confused with crush injury, which is the compression of the arms, legs, or other parts of the body that causes muscle swelling and/or neurological disturbances in the affected areas of the body, while crush syndrome is a localized crush injury with systemic manifestations. Cases occur commonly in catastrophes such as earthquakes, to individuals who have been trapped under fallen or moving masonry.
People with crushing damage present some of the greatest challenges in field medicine, and may need a physician's attention on the site of their injury. Appropriate physiological preparation of the injured is mandatory."
Infant Botulism Syndrome,"Constipation, difficulty swallowing, ptosis","Botulism is a rare and potentially fatal illness caused by botulinum toxin, which is produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The disease begins with weakness, blurred vision, feeling tired, and trouble speaking. This may then be followed by weakness of the arms, chest muscles, and legs. Vomiting, swelling of the abdomen, and diarrhea may also occur. The disease does not usually affect consciousness or cause a fever."
Adamantinoma of the Long Bones,"Muscle atrophy, slow growth, joint pain","Adamantinoma (from Greek  adamantinos 'very hard') is a rare bone cancer, making up less than 1% of all bone cancers. It almost always occurs in the bones of the lower leg and involves both epithelial and osteofibrous tissue.
The condition was first described by Fischer in 1913.


== Presentation ==
Patients typically present with swelling with or without pain. The slow-growing tumor predominantly arises in long bones in a subcortical location (95% in the tibia or fibula)."
Pediatric Metastatic Bone Tumors,"Weakness, persistent pain, muscle atrophy, tumor compression","Ewing sarcoma is a type of pediatric cancer that forms in bone or soft tissue. Symptoms may include swelling and pain at the site of the tumor, fever, and a bone fracture. The most common areas where it begins are the legs, pelvis, and chest wall. In about 25% of cases, the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis. Complications may include a pleural effusion or paraplegia."
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML),"Ataxia, paralysis, visual impairments, sensory disturbances","Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare and often fatal viral disease characterized by progressive damage (-pathy) or inflammation of the white matter (leuko-) of the brain (-encephalo-) at multiple locations (multifocal). It is caused by the JC virus, which is normally present and kept under control by the immune system. The JC virus is harmless except in cases of weakened immune systems. In general, PML has a mortality rate of 3050% in the first few months, and those who survive can be left with varying degrees of neurological disabilities.
PML occurs almost exclusively in patients with severe immune deficiency, most commonly among patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), but people on chronic immunosuppressive medications including chemotherapy are also at increased risk of PML, such as patients with transplants, Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases."
Osteosarcoma of Blood Vessels,"Local pain and swelling, sometimes palpable pulsation of vessels and audible vascular murmurs, obvious tenderness, limb movement disorders","A sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that arises from cells of mesenchymal origin. Originating from mesenchymal cells means that sarcomas are cancers of connective tissues such as bone, cartilage, muscle, fat, or vascular tissues. 
Sarcomas are one of five different types of cancer, classified by the cell type from which they originate. While there are five types under this category, sarcomas are most frequently contrasted with carcinomas which are much more common. Sarcomas are quite rare, making up about 1% of all adult cancer diagnoses and 15% of childhood cancer diagnoses."
Pilomatricoma,"Single, isolated nodule","Pilomatricoma is a benign skin tumor derived from the hair matrix. These neoplasms are relatively uncommon and typically occur on the scalp, face, and upper extremities. Clinically, pilomatricomas present as a subcutaneous nodule or cyst with unremarkable overlying epidermis that can range in size from 0.5 to 3.0 cm, but the largest reported case was 24 cm.


== Presentation ==


=== Associations ===
Pilomatricomas have been observed in a variety of genetic disorders including Turner syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, RubinsteinTaybi syndrome, trisomy 9, and Gardner syndrome. It has been reported that the prevalence of pilomatricomas in Turner syndrome is 2.6%."
Multiple Gastrointestinal Polyposis Syndrome,"Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, tingling, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, watery stool, bloody stool, discoloration of nails","Gardner's syndrome (also known as Gardner syndrome, familial polyposis of the colon, or familial colorectal polyposis) is a subtype of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Gardner syndrome is an autosomal dominant form of polyposis characterized by the presence of multiple polyps in the colon together with tumors outside the colon. The extracolonic tumors may include osteomas of the skull, thyroid cancer, epidermoid cysts, fibromas, as well as the occurrence of desmoid tumors in approximately 15% of affected individuals.
Desmoid tumors are fibrous tumors that usually occur in the tissue covering the intestines and may be provoked by surgery to remove the colon. The countless polyps in the colon predispose to the development of colon cancer; if the colon is not removed, the chance of colon cancer is considered to be very significant."
Intestinal Tumor,"Abdominal mass, severe pain, anemia, bloody stools, frequent and malformed bowel movements, weight loss and fatigue","Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as bowel cancer, colon cancer, or rectal cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine). Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, abdominal pain and fatigue. Most colorectal cancers are due to lifestyle factors and genetic disorders. Risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red meat, processed meat, and alcohol."
Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA),"Cyanosis, clubbing of fingers and toes, heart murmur, patent ductus arteriosus, bounding pulse, capillary pulsation","Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a medical condition in which the ductus arteriosus fails to close after birth: this allows a portion of oxygenated blood from the left heart to flow back to the lungs from the aorta, which has a higher blood pressure, to the pulmonary artery, which has a lower blood pressure. Symptoms are uncommon at birth and shortly thereafter, but later in the first year of life there is often the onset of an increased work of breathing and failure to gain weight at a normal rate. With time, an uncorrected PDA usually leads to pulmonary hypertension followed by right-sided heart failure.
The ductus arteriosus is a fetal blood vessel that normally closes soon after birth. This closure is caused by vessel constriction immediately after birth as circulation changes occur, followed by the occlusion of the vessels lumen in the following days."
Mushroom Poisoning,"Nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hepatotoxicity, coma, syncope, pupillary abnormalities, chest pain, headache, respiratory distress, jaundice, elevated transaminase","Mushroom poisoning is poisoning resulting from the ingestion of mushrooms that contain toxic substances. Symptoms can vary from slight gastrointestinal discomfort to death in about 10 days. Mushroom toxins are secondary metabolites produced by the fungus.
Mushroom poisoning is usually the result of ingestion of wild mushrooms after misidentification of a toxic mushroom as an edible species. The most common reason for this misidentification is a close resemblance in terms of color and general morphology of the toxic mushrooms species with edible species."
Drug-Induced Cardiomyopathy,"Arrhythmias, hypotension, supraventricular arrhythmias, sudden death, sinoatrial node disease, cardiac murmurs, palpitations, easy fainting, cardiac enlargement, heart failure, myocardial hypertrophy, poor perfusion of peripheral tissues","Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or takotsubo syndrome (TTS), also known as stress cardiomyopathy, is a type of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy in which there is a sudden temporary weakening of the muscular portion of the heart. It usually appears after a significant stressor, either physical or emotional; when caused by the latter, the condition is sometimes called broken heart syndrome. 
Examples of physical stressors that can cause TTS are sepsis, shock, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and pheochromocytoma. Emotional stressors include bereavement, divorce, or the loss of a job. Reviews suggest that of patients diagnosed with the condition, about 7080% recently experienced a major stressor, including 4150% with a physical stressor and 2630% with an emotional stressor."
Appendiceal Adenocarcinoma,"Cachexia, fatigue, ascites, loss of appetite, abdominal pain","Appendix cancer, also known as appendiceal cancer, is a very rare malignant tumor that forms in the vermiform appendix.
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are rare tumors with malignant potential. Primary lymphomas can occur in the appendix. Breast cancer, colon cancer, and tumors of the female genital tract may metastasize to the appendix.


== Diagnosis ==

Carcinoid tumors are the most common tumors of the appendix."
Epidermal Nevus,"Papules, oral leukoplakia, skin nevus","Nevus (pl.: nevi) is a nonspecific medical term for a visible, circumscribed, chronic lesion of the skin or mucosa. The term originates from nvus, which is Latin for ""birthmark""; however, a nevus can be either congenital (present at birth) or acquired. Common terms, including mole, birthmark, and beauty mark, are used to describe nevi, but these terms do not distinguish specific types of nevi from one another.


== Classification ==
The term nevus is applied to a number of conditions caused by neoplasias and hyperplasias of melanocytes, as well as a number of pigmentation disorders, both hypermelanotic (containing increased melanin, the pigment responsible for skin color) and hypomelanotic (containing decreased melanin). Suspicious skin moles which are multi-colored or pink may be a finding in skin cancer."
Acute Decompression Osteonecrosis,"Neuralgia, joint pain, dermatogenic contracture","Decompression sickness (DCS; also called divers' disease, the bends, aerobullosis, and caisson disease) is a medical condition caused by dissolved gases emerging from solution as bubbles inside the body tissues during decompression. DCS most commonly occurs during or soon after a decompression ascent from underwater diving, but can also result from other causes of depressurisation, such as emerging from a caisson, decompression from saturation, flying in an unpressurised aircraft at high altitude, and extravehicular activity from spacecraft. DCS and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as decompression illness.
Since bubbles can form in or migrate to any part of the body, DCS can produce many symptoms, and its effects may vary from joint pain and rashes to paralysis and death. DCS often causes air bubbles to settle in major joints like knees or elbows, causing individuals to bend over in excruciating pain, hence its common name, the bends."
Intraepithelial Carcinoma,"Swelling of skin tissue, fever, chest tightness, palpitation","Pancreatic cancer arises when cells in the pancreas, a glandular organ behind the stomach, begin to multiply out of control and form a mass. These cancerous cells have the ability to invade other parts of the body. A number of types of pancreatic cancer are known.
The most common, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, accounts for about 90% of cases, and the term ""pancreatic cancer"" is sometimes used to refer only to that type. These adenocarcinomas start within the part of the pancreas that makes digestive enzymes."
Hypertensive Crisis,"High blood pressure, headache, nausea and vomiting, visual disturbances, restlessness, excessive sweating, dry mouth, palpitations, chills, limb tremors, papilledema, retinal hemorrhage","Severely elevated blood pressure (equal to or greater than 180 mmHg systolic or 120 mmHg diastolic) is referred to as a hypertensive crisis (sometimes termed malignant or accelerated hypertension), due to the high risk of complications. People with blood pressures in this range may have no symptoms, but are more likely to report headaches (22% of cases) and dizziness than the general population. Other symptoms accompanying a hypertensive crisis may include visual deterioration due to retinopathy, breathlessness due to heart failure, or a general feeling of malaise due to kidney failure.
Most people with a hypertensive crisis are known to have elevated blood pressure, but additional triggers may have led to a sudden rise.


== Symptoms and treatment ==
A ""hypertensive emergency"" is diagnosed when there is evidence of direct damage to one or more organs as a result of severely elevated blood pressure greater than 180 mmHg systolic or 120 mmHg diastolic."
Atrophic Gastritis,"Epigastric burning, distension, dull pain, or fullness, especially after eating, loss of appetite, nausea, belching, constipation, severe cases may include weight loss, anemia, and patients with gastric mucosal erosion may experience upper gastrointestinal bleeding","Atrophic gastritis  is a process of chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa of the stomach, leading to a loss of gastric glandular cells and their eventual replacement by intestinal and fibrous tissues. As a result, the stomach's secretion of essential substances such as hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and intrinsic factor is impaired, leading to digestive problems. The most common are pernicious anemia possibly leading to vitamin B12 deficiency; and malabsorption of iron, leading to iron deficiency anaemia. It can be caused by persistent infection with Helicobacter pylori, or can be autoimmune in origin. Those with autoimmune atrophic gastritis (Type A gastritis) are statistically more likely to develop gastric carcinoma (a form of stomach cancer), Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and achlorhydria."
Primary Hepatic Liposarcoma,"Emaciation, pain in the right upper abdomen, radiating pain, decreased appetite, fatigue, intractable hiccup, palmar erythema, spider angiomas","The International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) is a domain-specific extension of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems for tumor diseases. This classification is widely used by cancer registries.
It is currently in its third revision (ICD-O-3). ICD-10 includes a list of morphology codes. They stem from ICD-O second edition (ICD-O-2) that was valid at the time of publication."
Secondary Leukemia,"Axillary lymph node enlargement, non-infectious fever, easy bruising, fatigue, anemia, hematuria, fever with bleeding, repeated bleeding, signs of sepsis, bacteremia, septicemia","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal cells that build up in the bone marrow and blood and interfere with normal blood cell production. Symptoms may include feeling tired, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. Occasionally, spread may occur to the brain, skin, or gums. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly, and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.
Risk factors include getting older, being male, smoking, previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy, myelodysplastic syndrome, and exposure to the chemical benzene."
Peptic Ulcer Perforation,"Abdominal pain, pallor, cold limbs, belching, nausea, vomiting with blood","Gastrointestinal perforation, also known as gastrointestinal rupture, is a hole in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. The gastrointestinal tract is composed of hollow digestive organs leading from the mouth to the anus. Symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation commonly include severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Complications include a painful inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall and sepsis.
Perforation may be caused by trauma, bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, stomach ulcers, cancer, or infection."
Deficiency Asthma (Xu Chuan),"Sweating, fatigue, lethargy, mouth opening with shoulder lifting","Autophagy protein 5 (ATG5) is a protein that, in humans, is encoded by the ATG5 gene located on chromosome 6. It is an E3 ubi autophagic cell death. ATG5 is a key protein involved in the extension of the phagophoric membrane in autophagic vesicles.  It is activated by ATG7 and forms a complex with ATG12 and ATG16L1.  This complex is necessary for LC3-I (microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B) conjugation to PE (phosphatidylethanolamine) to form LC3-II (LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate)."
Arsine-induced Hemolytic Anemia,"Hepatomegaly, Malignant Anemia, Anemic Appearance","Hemolytic anemia or haemolytic anaemia is a form of anemia due to hemolysis, the abnormal breakdown of red blood cells (RBCs), either in the blood vessels (intravascular hemolysis) or elsewhere in the human body (extravascular). This most commonly occurs within the spleen, but also can occur in the reticuloendothelial system or mechanically (prosthetic valve damage). Hemolytic anemia accounts for 5% of all existing anemias. It has numerous possible consequences, ranging from general symptoms to life-threatening systemic effects. The general classification of hemolytic anemia is either intrinsic or extrinsic."
Pneumococcal Pneumonia,"High fever, chills, muscle soreness, poor appetite, fatigue, restlessness, moaning, and shortness of breath","Pneumococcal pneumonia is a type of bacterial pneumonia that is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). It is the most common bacterial pneumonia found in adults, the most common type of community-acquired pneumonia, and one of the common types of pneumococcal infection. The estimated number of Americans with pneumococcal pneumonia is 900,000 annually, with almost 400,000 cases hospitalized and fatalities accounting for 5-7% of these cases.


== Symptoms ==
The symptoms of pneumococcal pneumonia can occur suddenly, presenting as a severe chill, followed by a severe fever, cough, shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and chest pains. Other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, and muscle aches could also accompany initial symptoms."
Secondary Peritonitis,"Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, peritonitis signs, cough, pallor, rapid breathing, cyanosis of the lips, drop in blood pressure, metabolic acidosis, shock, acute illness appearance, abdominal distention","Peritonitis is inflammation of the localized or generalized peritoneum, the lining of the inner wall of the abdomen and covering of the abdominal organs. Symptoms may include severe pain, swelling of the abdomen, fever, or weight loss. One part or the entire abdomen may be tender. Complications may include shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Causes include perforation of the intestinal tract, pancreatitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, stomach ulcer, cirrhosis, a ruptured appendix or even a perforated gallbladder."
Cancerous Ulceration,"Fatigue, hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, weakness, weight loss, chest tightness, progressive neck mass","A mouth ulcer (aphtha), or sometimes called a canker sore or salt blister, is an ulcer that occurs on the mucous membrane of the oral cavity. Mouth ulcers are very common, occurring in association with many diseases and by many different mechanisms, but usually there is no serious underlying cause. Rarely, a mouth ulcer that does not heal may be a sign of oral cancer. These ulcers may form individually or multiple ulcers may appear at once (i.e., a ""crop"" of ulcers). Once formed, an ulcer may be maintained by inflammation and/or secondary infection."
Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS),"Macroglossia, umbilical hernia, abnormal body proportions, cryptorchidism, clitoromegaly, cardiac malformations, megacalycosis, palpitations with fatigue, pallor, tremors in both hands","BeckwithWiedemann syndrome (; abbreviated BWS) is an overgrowth disorder usually present at birth, characterized by an increased risk of childhood cancer and certain congenital features. A minority (<15%) of cases of BWS are familial, meaning that a close relative may also have BWS, and parents of an affected child may be at increased risk of having other children with BWS. While children with BWS are at increased risk of childhood cancer, most children with BWS do not develop cancer and the vast majority of children who do develop cancer can be treated successfully.


== Presentation ==

No consensus clinical diagnostic criteria for BeckwithWiedemann syndrome (BWS) exist. BeckwithWiedemann syndrome (BWS) should be suspected in individuals who have one or more of the following major and/or minor findings.
Major findings associated with BWS

Macrosomia (traditionally defined as weight and length/height >97th centile)
Macroglossia
Hemihyperplasia (asymmetric overgrowth of one or more regions of the body)
Omphalocele (also called exomphalos) or umbilical hernia
Embryonal tumor (e.g., Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma) in childhood
Visceromegaly involving one or more intra-abdominal organs including liver, spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands, and/or pancreas
Cytomegaly of the fetal adrenal cortex (pathognomonic)
Renal abnormalities including structural abnormalities, nephromegaly, nephrocalcinosis, and/or later development of medullary sponge kidney
Anterior linear ear lobe creases and/or posterior helical ear pits
Placental mesenchymal dysplasia

Positive family history (1 family members with a clinical diagnosis of BWS or a history or features suggestive of BWS)
Congenital hyperinsulinism
Minor findings associated with BWS

Pregnancy-related findings including polyhydramnios and prematurity in fetuses with the condition."
Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome,"Fever, chills, headache, cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue","Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), also called hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), is a severe respiratory disease caused by hantaviruses. The main features of illness are microvascular leakage and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Symptoms occur anywhere from one to eight weeks after exposure to the virus and come in three distinct phases. First, there is an early phase with flu-like symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, headache, and shortness of breath, as well as low platelet count. Second, there is cardiopulmonary phase during which people experience elevated or irregular heart rate, cardiogenic shock, and pulmonary capillary leakage, which can lead to respiratory failure, low blood pressure, and buildup of fluid in the lungs and chest cavity."
Iron Deficiency Anemia in the Elderly,"Pallor, palpitations, fatigue, dizziness, heart palpitations, decreased immunity, dry skin, brittle nails","Iron deficiency, or sideropenia, is the state in which a body lacks enough iron to supply its needs. Iron is present in all cells in the human body and has several vital functions, such as carrying oxygen to the tissues from the lungs as a key component of the hemoglobin protein, acting as a transport medium for electrons within the cells in the form of cytochromes, and facilitating oxygen enzyme reactions in various tissues. Too little iron can interfere with these vital functions and lead to morbidity and death.
Total body iron averages approximately 3.8 g in men and 2.3 g in women. In blood plasma, iron is carried tightly bound to the protein transferrin."
Rectal Injury,"Rectal pain, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, shock, intestinal bleeding, peritonitis, cellulitis, difficulty urinating and urinary retention","Digital rectal examination (DRE), also known as a prostate exam (Latin: palpatio per anum (PPA), lit.'palpation through the anus'), is an internal examination of the rectum performed by a healthcare provider.
Prior to a 2018 report from the United States Preventive Services Task Force, a digital exam was a common component of annual medical examination for older men, as it was thought to be a reliable screening test for prostate cancer.


== Usage ==
This examination may be used:

for the diagnosis of prostatic disorders, benign prostatic hyperplasia and the four types of prostatitis. Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome, chronic bacterial prostatitis, acute (sudden) bacterial prostatitis, and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis. The DRE has a 50% specificity for benign prostatic hyperplasia."
Chronic Hepatitis,"Abnormal cellular enzyme activity, insufficient liver qi, liver qi attacking spleen, liver depression and qi stagnation, liver texture hardening, liver shrinkage, liver capsule hematoma rupture, hepatogenic edema, liver calcification, liver qi attacking stomach, elevated transaminases, wiry pulse","Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue. Some people or animals with hepatitis have no symptoms, whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hepatitis is acute if it resolves within six months, and chronic if it lasts longer than six months. Acute hepatitis can resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or (rarely) result in acute liver failure. Chronic hepatitis may progress to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer."
Verruca Vulgaris,"Generally asymptomatic, occasional tenderness, semicircular or polygonal papules","Warts are non-cancerous viral growths usually occurring on the hands and feet but which can also affect other locations, such as the genitals or face. One or many warts may appear. They are distinguished from cancerous tumors as they are caused by a viral infection, such as a human papillomavirus,  rather than a cancer growth.
Factors that increase the risk include the use of public showers and pools, working with meat, eczema, and a weak immune system. The virus is believed to infect the host through the entrance of a skin wound."
Pancoast Syndrome,"Shoulder pain, enophthalmos, abnormal pupil, axillary pain","A Pancoast tumor is a tumor of the apex of the lung. It is a type of lung cancer defined primarily by its location situated at the top end of either the right or left lung. It typically spreads to nearby tissues such as the ribs and vertebrae. Most Pancoast tumors are non-small-cell lung cancers.
The growing tumor can cause compression of many nearby structures, such as the brachiocephalic vein, subclavian artery, phrenic nerve, recurrent laryngeal nerve, vagus nerve, or, characteristically, compression of a sympathetic ganglion (the stellate ganglion), which result in various presenting symptoms, most notably a range of symptoms known as Horner's syndrome due to compression of nearby sympathetic nerves."
Neutropenia,"Prone to infections, fatigue, malaise","Neutropenia is an abnormally low concentration of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) in the blood. Neutrophils make up the majority of circulating white blood cells and serve as the primary defense against infections by destroying bacteria, bacterial fragments and immunoglobulin-bound viruses in the blood. People with neutropenia are more susceptible to bacterial infections and, without prompt medical attention, the condition may become life-threatening (neutropenic sepsis).
Neutropenia can be divided into congenital and acquired, with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) and cyclic neutropenia (CyN) being autosomal dominant and mostly caused by heterozygous mutations in the ELANE gene (neutrophil elastase). Neutropenia can be acute (temporary) or chronic (long lasting)."
Vulvar Angiosarcoma,"Vulvar itching, vulvar swelling, burning sensation during urination, itching or pain","Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia (IPEH), also known as Masson's hemangio-endotheliome vegetant intravasculaire, Masson's lesion, Masson's pseudoangiosarcoma, Masson's tumor, and papillary endothelial hyperplasia, is a rare, benign tumor.  It may mimic an angiosarcoma, with lesions that are red or purplish 5-mm to 5-cm papules and deep nodules on the head, neck, or upper extremities.:592
The cause of intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia is unknown. Risk factors include a history of local trauma or prior vascular disorders.
Immunohistochemistry and histopathology are used to make the diagnosis of intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia. Differential diagnosis includes vascular malformation, angioma, pyogenic granuloma, angiosarcoma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, Kaposis sarcoma, and other more rare vascular tumors."
Childhood Leukemia,"Gum bleeding, nosebleed, uncontrolled bleeding, anemia, swelling of lymph nodes, liver, spleen enlargement, fever, oral mucosal ulceration, swollen gums","Childhood leukemia is leukemia that occurs in a child and is a type of childhood cancer. Childhood leukemia is the most common childhood cancer, accounting for 29% of cancers in children aged 014 in 2018. There are multiple forms of leukemia that occur in children, the most common being acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) followed by acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Survival rates vary depending on the type of leukemia, but may be as high as 90% in ALL.
Leukemia is a hematological malignancy or a cancer of the blood. It develops in the bone marrow, the soft inner part of bones where new blood cells are made."
Lobular Carcinoma of the Breast,"Breast swelling, breast pain, mammary gland hyperplasia and hypertrophy","Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is breast cancer arising from the lobules of the mammary glands. It accounts for 510% of invasive breast cancer. Rare cases of this carcinoma have been diagnosed in men (see male breast cancer).


== Types ==

The histologic patterns include:

		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		
		
			
			
		


== Prognosis ==
Overall, the five-year survival rate of invasive lobular carcinoma was approximately 85% in 2003.


== Diagnosis ==
On mammography, ILC shows spiculated mass with ill-defined margins that has similar or lower density than surrounding breast tissues."

Uremic Pneumonia,"Dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, oliguria, fever, productive cough, chronic renal failure","Hemolyticuremic syndrome (HUS) is a syndrome characterized by low red blood cells, acute kidney injury (previously called acute renal failure), and low platelets. Initial symptoms typically include bloody diarrhea, fever, vomiting, and weakness. Kidney problems and low platelets then occur as the diarrhea progresses. Children are more commonly affected, but most children recover without permanent damage to their health, although some children may have serious and sometimes life-threatening complications. Adults, especially the elderly, may show a more complicated presentation."
Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN),"Oliguria or anuria, hematuria, heavy proteinuria, edema, purpura","Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is a syndrome of the kidney that is characterized by a rapid loss of kidney function, (usually a 50% decline in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) within 3 months) with glomerular crescent formation seen in at least 50% or 75% of glomeruli seen on kidney biopsies. If left untreated, it rapidly progresses into acute kidney failure and death within months. In 50% of cases, RPGN is associated with an underlying disease such as Goodpasture syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus or granulomatosis with polyangiitis; the remaining cases are idiopathic. Regardless of the underlying cause, RPGN involves severe injury to the kidneys' glomeruli, with many of the glomeruli containing characteristic glomerular crescents (crescent-shaped scars).


== Signs and symptoms ==
Most types of RPGN are characterized by severe and rapid loss of kidney function with marked hematuria; red blood cell casts in the urine; and proteinuria sometimes exceeding three grams in twenty-four hours, a range associated with nephrotic syndrome."
Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy,"Visual impairment, vitreous haze","Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR, pronounced as fever) is a genetic disorder affecting the growth and development of blood vessels in the retina of the eye. This disease can lead to visual impairment and sometimes complete blindness in one or both eyes. FEVR is characterized by incomplete vascularization of the peripheral retina. This can lead to the growth of new blood vessels which are prone to leakage and hemorrhage and can cause retinal folds, tears, and detachments. Treatment involves laser photocoagulation of the avascular portions of the retina to reduce new blood vessel growth and risk of complications including leakage of retinal blood vessels and retinal detachments."
Cauda Equina Syndrome,"Loss of sensation and proprioception, paraplegia","Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a condition that occurs when the bundle of nerves below the end of the spinal cord known as the cauda equina is damaged. Signs and symptoms include low back pain, pain that radiates down the leg, numbness around the anus, and loss of bowel or bladder control. Onset may be rapid or gradual.
The cause is usually a disc herniation in the lower region of the back. Other causes include spinal stenosis, cancer, trauma, epidural abscess, and epidural hematoma."

Acute Upper Respiratory Infection,"Chills and fever, cough with sputum, body aches, nasal congestion and runny nose","An upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is an illness caused by an acute infection, which involves the upper respiratory tract, including the nose, sinuses, pharynx, larynx or trachea. This commonly includes nasal obstruction, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, sinusitis, otitis media, and the common cold.:28 Most infections are viral in nature, and in other instances, the cause is bacterial. URTIs can also be fungal or helminthic in origin, but these are less common.:443445
In 2015, 17.2 billion cases of URTIs are estimated to have occurred. As of 2016, they caused about 3,000 deaths, down from 4,000 in 1990.


== Signs and symptoms ==

In uncomplicated colds, coughing and nasal discharge may persist for 14 days or more even after other symptoms have resolved."
Post-traumatic Brain Abscess,"Infectious fever, meningeal irritation signs, increased intracranial pressure, vomiting, emaciation, headache, edema, coma, nausea and vomiting, retinal edema","A traumatic brain injury (TBI), also known as an intracranial injury, is an injury to the brain caused by an external force. TBI can be classified based on severity ranging from mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI/concussion) to severe traumatic brain injury. TBI can also be characterized based on mechanism (closed or penetrating head injury) or other features (e.g., occurring in a specific location or over a widespread area). Head injury is a broader category that may involve damage to other structures such as the scalp and skull. TBI can result in physical, cognitive, social, emotional and behavioral symptoms, and outcomes can range from complete recovery to permanent disability or death."
Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP),"Mucopurulent bloody stool, fatigue, weight loss, increased frequency of bowel movements","Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant inherited condition in which numerous adenomatous polyps form mainly in the epithelium of the large intestine. While these polyps start out benign, malignant transformation into colon cancer occurs when they are left untreated. Three variants are known to exist, FAP and attenuated FAP (originally called hereditary flat adenoma syndrome) are caused by APC gene defects on chromosome 5 while autosomal recessive FAP (or MUTYH-associated polyposis) is caused by defects in the MUTYH gene on chromosome 1. Of the three, FAP itself is the most severe and most common; although for all three, the resulting colonic polyps and cancers are initially confined to the colon wall. Detection and removal before metastasis outside the colon can greatly reduce and in many cases eliminate the spread of cancer."
Fibrofolliculomas,"Papules scattered on the face, trunk, and limbs.","BirtHoggDub syndrome (BHD), also HornsteinBirtHoggDub syndrome, HornsteinKnickenberg syndrome, and fibrofolliculomas with trichodiscomas and acrochordons is a human, adult onset, autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the folliculin (FLCN) gene. It can cause susceptibility to kidney cancer, renal and pulmonary cysts, and noncancerous tumors of the hair follicles, called fibrofolliculomas. The symptoms seen in each family are unique, and can include any combination of the three symptoms. Fibrofolliculomas are the most common manifestation, found on the face and upper trunk in over 80% of people with BHD over the age of 40. Pulmonary cysts are equally common (84%) and 24% of people with BHD eventually experience a collapsed lung (spontaneous pneumothorax)."
Meningococcal Pneumonia,"cough, purulent sputum, frothy sputum, chest pain, chills, high fever, moist rales","Meningococcal disease is a serious infection caused by Neisseria meningitidis, also known  as meningococcus, a gram negative diplococcus. Meningococcal disease includes meningitis,  meningococcal septicemia, or a combination of both, which can be life-threatening and rapidly progressive. If left untreated, the disease has a high mortality rate; however, it is preventable through vaccination. Meningitis and meningococcal sepsis are major causes of illness, death, and disability in both developed and under-developed countries.
Meningococcal disease can be transmitted to others through saliva, close contact with an infected individual by inhaling respiratory air droplets."
Post-burn Acute Renal Failure,"Decreased urine specific gravity, coma, renal failure, shock, difficulty in urination and urinary retention, reduced glomerular filtration rate, hypovolemic shock, oliguria, azotemia","Pulmonary edema (British English: oedema), also known as pulmonary congestion, is excessive fluid accumulation in the tissue or air spaces (usually alveoli) of the lungs. This leads to impaired gas exchange, most often leading to shortness of breath (dyspnea) which can progress to hypoxemia and respiratory failure. Pulmonary edema has multiple causes and is traditionally classified as cardiogenic (caused by the heart) or noncardiogenic (all other types not caused by the heart).
Various laboratory tests (CBC, troponin, BNP, etc.) and imaging studies (chest x-ray, CT scan, ultrasound) are often used to diagnose and classify the cause of pulmonary edema. 
Treatment is focused on three aspects: 

improving respiratory function,
treating the underlying cause, and
preventing further damage and allow full recovery to the lung."
Gastric Mucosal Prolapse,"Prolapse of the gastric mucosa, abdominal pain, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal distension, abdominal discomfort, belching, nausea and vomiting, anemia, loss of appetite, weight loss","A rectal prolapse occurs when walls of the rectum have prolapsed to such a degree that they protrude out of the anus and are visible outside the body. However, most researchers agree that there are 3 to 5 different types of rectal prolapse, depending on whether the prolapsed section is visible externally, and whether the full or only partial thickness of the rectal wall is involved.
Rectal prolapse may occur without any symptoms, but depending upon the nature of the prolapse there may be mucous discharge (mucus coming from the anus), rectal bleeding, degrees of fecal incontinence, and obstructed defecation symptoms.
Rectal prolapse is generally more common in elderly women, although it may occur at any age and in either sex. It is very rarely life-threatening, but the symptoms can be debilitating if left untreated."
Whipple's disease,"Joint pain, diarrhea, small intestine distension with gas, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly","Whipple's disease is a rare systemic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Tropheryma whipplei. First described by George Hoyt Whipple in 1907 and commonly considered as a gastrointestinal disorder, Whipple's disease primarily causes malabsorption, but may affect any part of the human body, including the heart, brain, joints, skin, lungs and the eyes. Weight loss, diarrhea, joint pain, and arthritis are common presenting symptoms, but the presentation can be highly variable in certain individuals, and about 15% of patients do not have the standard signs and symptoms.
Whipple's disease is significantly more common in men, with 87% of patients diagnosed being male. When recognized and treated, Whipple's disease can usually be cured with long-term antibiotic therapy, but if the disease is left undiagnosed or untreated, it can ultimately be fatal."
Gastric Tumor,"Gastric discomfort, pain, vomiting blood, black stools","== Tumors of the stomach ==

Tumors of the stomach are known as gastric tumors, and can be either benign or malignant (gastric cancer). These tumors arise from the cells of the gastric mucosa which lines the stomach. Typically, most gastric tumors are cancerous and not detected until a later stage for various reasons.


== Types ==
There are two distinct types of tumors: benign and malignant. Both types of tumors share a number of general characteristics, the broadest being that they are an abnormal proliferation of cells."
Cerebral Arteriosclerosis,"Headache, dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, hand tremors, limb numbness, poor sleep, and memory decline","Arteriosclerosis, literally meaning ""hardening of the arteries"", is an umbrella term for a vascular disorder characterized by abnormal thickening, hardening, and loss of elasticity of the walls of arteries; this process gradually restricts the blood flow to one's organs and tissues and can lead to severe health risks brought on by atherosclerosis, which is a specific form of arteriosclerosis caused by the buildup of fatty plaques, cholesterol, and some other substances in and on the artery walls (it can be brought on by smoking, a bad diet, or many genetic factors).
Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of coronary artery disease (CAD) and stroke, with multiple genetic and environmental contributions. Genetic-epidemiologic studies have identified a long list of genetic and non-genetic risk factors for CAD. However, such studies indicate that family history is the most significant independent risk factor.


== Signs and symptoms ==
The signs and symptoms of arteriosclerosis depend on the vessel affected by the disease. If affecting cerebral or ophthalmic vessels, as in cerebrovascular accidents or transient ischemic attacks, signs and symptoms may include sudden weakness, facial or lower limb numbness, confusion, difficulty understanding speech, and problems seeing."
Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST),"Irregular fever with chills, general malaise and muscle pain, weakness, weight loss, headaches, vomiting, seizures, disturbances in consciousness, difficulty swallowing, coughing when drinking water, unclear articulation","Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis or cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), is the presence of a blood clot in the dural venous sinuses (which drain blood from the brain), the cerebral veins, or both. Symptoms may include severe headache, visual symptoms, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs on one side of the body, and seizures, which occur in around 40% of patients.
The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses. After confirmation of the diagnosis, investigations may be performed to determine the underlying cause, especially if one is not readily apparent.
Treatment is typically with anticoagulants (medications that suppress blood clotting) such as low molecular weight heparin."
Pediatric Arrhythmia,"Dizziness, syncope, sinoatrial block, bradycardia, vomiting, palpitations with fatigue, pallor, heart failure, tachycardia, bradycardia, hemodynamic disturbances, refusal to eat, tachycardia","Pediatric advanced life support (PALS) is a course offered by the American Heart Association (AHA) for health care providers who take care of children and infants in the emergency room, critical care and intensive care units in the hospital, and out of hospital (emergency medical services (EMS)). The course teaches healthcare providers how to assess injured and sick children and recognize and treat respiratory distress/failure, shock, cardiac arrest, and arrhythmias.


== Basic Life Support (BLS) ==

PALS builds upon AHA's Pediatric Basic Life Support (BLS). Providers should follow the AHA's Pediatric BLS Algorithms for single and  2 person rescuer. The most essential component of BLS and PALS cardiac arrest care is high quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)."
Ichthyosis,"Dry, rough skin on the limbs and trunk, accompanied by diamond-shaped or polygonal scales, fish scale-like or snake skin-like appearance, skin cracks, and epidermal stiffness.","Ichthyosis is a family of genetic skin disorders characterized by dry, thickened, scaly skin. The more than 20 types of ichthyosis range in severity of symptoms, outward appearance, underlying genetic cause and mode of inheritance (e.g., dominant, recessive, autosomal or X-linked). Ichthyosis comes from Greek   (ichthys) 'fish', since dry, scaly skin is the defining feature of all forms of ichthyosis.
The severity of symptoms can vary enormously, from the mildest, most common, types such as ichthyosis vulgaris, which may be mistaken for normal dry skin, up to life-threatening conditions such as harlequin-type ichthyosis.  Ichthyosis vulgaris accounts for more than 95% of cases."
Functional Dyspepsia,"Belching, acid reflux, damage to both the spleen and stomach, undigested food particles, nausea, bloating, discomfort in the upper abdomen, reduced appetite","Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a common gastrointestinal disorder defined by symptoms arising from the gastroduodenal region in the absence of an underlying organic disease that could easily explain the symptoms. Characteristic symptoms include epigastric burning, epigastric pain, postprandial fullness, and early satiety. FD was formerly known as non-ulcer dyspepsia, as opposed to ""organic dyspepsia"" with underlying conditions of gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, or cancer.
The exact cause of functional dyspepsia is unknown however there have been many hypotheses regarding the mechanisms. Theories behind the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia include gastroduodenal motility, gastroduodenal sensitivity, intestinal microbiota, immune dysfunction, gut-brain axis dysfunction, abnormalities of gastric electrical rhythm, and autonomic nervous system/central nervous system dysregulation."
Ovarian Mixed Germ Cell-Sex Cord-Stromal Tumor,"Irregular vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, lower abdominal mass, endocrine disorders","A germ cell tumor (GCT) is a neoplasm derived from primordial germ cells. Germ-cell tumors can be cancerous or benign. Germ cell tumors typically originate from  the gonads (ovary and testis), but can arise in other areas of the body. Extragonadal GCTs are thought to result from abnormal migration of germ cell precursors during development of the embryo.


== Classification ==

GCTs are classified by their histology, regardless of location in the body."
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD),"Neurasthenia syndrome, memory disorders, limb weakness, unsteady gait, lack of concentration, joint rigidity, progressive muscular paralysis, tremors, irritability, headache, dizziness, fatigue","CreutzfeldtJakob disease (CJD) is an incurable, always fatal neurodegenerative disease belonging to the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) group. Early symptoms include memory problems, behavioral changes, poor coordination, and visual and/or auditory disturbances. Later symptoms include dementia, involuntary movements, blindness and/or deafness, weakness, and coma. About 70% of people die within a year of diagnosis. The name ""CreutzfeldtJakob disease"" was introduced by Walther Spielmeyer in 1922, after the German neurologists Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt and Alfons Maria Jakob."
Esophagogastric Varices and Their Rupture and Hemorrhage,"Varicose veins, cachexia, weakness, loss of appetite, spider angiomas, palmar erythema, splenomegaly, edema, diarrhea, ascites","Esophageal varices are extremely dilated sub-mucosal veins in the lower third of the esophagus. They are most often a consequence of portal hypertension, commonly due to cirrhosis. People with esophageal varices have a strong tendency to develop severe bleeding which left untreated can be fatal. Esophageal varices are typically diagnosed through an esophagogastroduodenoscopy.


== Pathogenesis ==

The upper two thirds of the esophagus are drained via the esophageal veins, which carry deoxygenated blood from the esophagus to the azygos vein, which in turn drains directly into the superior vena cava."
Coats' Disease,"Eye hemorrhage, retinal hemorrhage, retinal edema","Feline disease refers to infections or illnesses  that affect cats. They may cause symptoms, sickness or the death of the animal. Some diseases are symptomatic in one cat but asymptomatic in others. Feline diseases are often opportunistic and tend to be more serious in cats that already have concurrent sicknesses. Some of these can be treated and the animal can have a complete recovery."
Pediatric Erythroderma,"Facial flushing, neck flushing, diffuse skin flushing, localized burning sensation, conjunctival congestion, skin flushing and swelling, sore throat, diarrhea, respiratory distress, edema, shock","Psoriatic erythroderma  represents a form of psoriasis that affects all body sites, including the face, hands, feet, nails, trunk, and extremities.:410411:195  This specific form of psoriasis affects 3 percent of persons diagnosed with psoriasis. First-line treatments for psoriatic erythroderma include immunosuppressive medications such as methotrexate, acitretin, or ciclosporin.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Psoriatic erythroderma displays generalized cutaneous symptoms, including scaling, hair loss, erythema, edema, pruritus, diffuse desquamation, and occasionally exudative lesions and palmoplantar or diffuse psoriatic plaques. Psoriatic erythroderma frequently results in changes to the nails, which can vary from minor pitting to severe onychodystrophy and typically affect the fingernails rather than the toenails. Systemic symptoms may also include fever, tachycardia, chills, exhaustion, malaise, lymphadenopathy, myalgia, arthralgia, insomnia, diarrhea, sweats, constipation, changes in weight, allodynia, and, in rare cases, high output heart failure (caused by excessive edema and water loss) and cachexia."
Atrial Fibrillation in the Elderly,"Palpitations, bradycardia, chest tightness, angina, dizziness, fatigue, discomfort or slight pain in the precordial area, angina pectoris, fainting, hemoptysis","Atrial fibrillation (AF, AFib or A-fib) is an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) characterized by rapid and irregular beating of the atrial chambers of the heart. It often begins as short periods of abnormal beating, which become longer or continuous over time.  It may also start as other forms of arrhythmia such as atrial flutter that then transform into AF.
Episodes can be asymptomatic. Symptomatic episodes may involve heart palpitations, fainting, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, or shortness of breath. Atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, dementia, and stroke."
Infrared Radiation Injury,"Color vision abnormalities, increased intraocular pressure, pigment spots, hallucinations","Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), also known as radiation sickness or radiation poisoning, is a collection of health effects that are caused by being exposed to high amounts of ionizing radiation in a short period of time. Symptoms can start within an hour of exposure, and can last for several months. Early symptoms are usually nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite. In the following hours or weeks, initial symptoms may appear to improve, before the development of additional symptoms, after which either recovery or death follows.
ARS involves a total dose of greater than 0.7 Gy (70 rad), that generally occurs from a source outside the body, delivered within a few minutes."
Sudden Cardiac Death Syndrome,"Precordial dull pain, difficulty breathing, palpitations, fatigue, convulsions, slow and shallow breathing, cyanosis","Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS) is a sudden unexpected death of adolescents and adults caused by a cardiac arrest. However, the exact cause of the cardiac arrest, and thus the exact cause of death, is unknown. These deaths occur mainly during sleep or at rest. One type of conduction defect known as Brugada syndrome can be responsible.
The syndrome is rare in most areas around the world but occurs in populations that are culturally and genetically distinct."
Hypertension in the Elderly,"Headache, dizziness, head distension, nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, blurred vision, memory loss, lack of concentration","Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms itself. It is, however, a major risk factor for stroke, coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, vision loss, chronic kidney disease, and dementia. Hypertension is a major cause of premature death worldwide.
High blood pressure is classified as primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension."
Acute Peritonitis,"Hypotension, dehydration, fever, sudden right upper quadrant colic, rebound pain in the lower abdomen, gastrointestinal distension, nausea, vomiting, muscular defense of the abdomen, and left abdominal flexure","Peritonitis is inflammation of the localized or generalized peritoneum, the lining of the inner wall of the abdomen and covering of the abdominal organs. Symptoms may include severe pain, swelling of the abdomen, fever, or weight loss. One part or the entire abdomen may be tender. Complications may include shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Causes include perforation of the intestinal tract, pancreatitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, stomach ulcer, cirrhosis, a ruptured appendix or even a perforated gallbladder."
Choroidal Malignant Melanoma,"Decreased visual acuity, glaucoma, eye pain, congestion, bleeding","An eye neoplasm is a tumor of the eye. A rare type of tumor, eye neoplasms can affect all parts of the eye, and can either be benign or malignant (cancerous), in which case it is known as eye cancer. Eye cancers can be primary (starts within the eye) or metastatic cancer (spread to the eye from another organ). The two most common cancers that spread to the eye from another organ are breast cancer and lung cancer. Other less common sites of origin include the prostate, kidney, thyroid, skin, colon and blood or bone marrow."
Diabetic Cardiomyopathy,"Arrhythmias, angina, cardiomegaly, atrioventricular block, heart failure","Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a disorder of the heart muscle in people with diabetes. It can lead to inability of the heart to circulate blood through the body effectively, a state known as heart failure(HF), with accumulation of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) or legs (peripheral edema). Most heart failure in people with diabetes results from coronary artery disease, and diabetic cardiomyopathy is only said to exist if there is no coronary artery disease to explain the heart muscle disorder.


== Signs and symptoms ==
One particularity of diabetic cardiomyopathy is the long latent phase, during which the disease progresses but is completely asymptomatic. In most cases, diabetic cardiomyopathy is detected with concomitant hypertension or coronary artery disease."
Pediatric Fever,"Fever, Cough","Enteric fever is a medical term encompassing two types of salmonellosis, which, specifically, are typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever. Enteric fever is a potentially life-threatening acute febrile systemic infection and is diagnosed by isolating a pathogen on culture. Typhoid fever is caused by the Salmonella enterica bacteria, serotype typhi, while paratyphoid fever is caused by the Salmonella enterica bacteria, serotype paratyphi A, B, or C. These Salmonella enterica bacteria serovars that cause enteric fever only have human hosts, as opposed to other types of salmonellosis-causing Salmonella bacteria  which often have animal reservoirs."
Trigeminal Neuralgia,"Facial pain, bleeding, numbness","Trigeminal neuralgia (TN or TGN), also called Fothergill disease, tic douloureux, trifacial neuralgia, is a long-term pain disorder that affects the trigeminal nerve, the nerve responsible for sensation in the face and motor functions such as biting and chewing. It is a form of neuropathic pain. There are two main types: typical and atypical trigeminal neuralgia.
The typical form results in episodes of severe, sudden, shock-like pain in one side of the face that lasts for seconds to a few minutes. Groups of these episodes can occur over a few hours."
Primary Macroglobulinemia,"Anemia, bleeding (common skin purpura, epistaxis), lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, syndromic visual impairment, transient paralysis, reflex abnormalities, hearing loss, consciousness disorders, and even coma. Heart failure can also occur.","Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia ( VAL-dn-strom MAK-roh-GLOB-y-lin-EE-mee-, US also  VAHL-dn-strem -) is a type of cancer affecting two types of white blood cells: lymphoplasmacytoid cells and plasma cells (both B cells). It is characterized by having high levels of a circulating antibody, immunoglobulin M (IgM), which is made and secreted by the cells involved in the disease. Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia is an ""indolent lymphoma"" (i.e., one that tends to grow and spread slowly) and a type of lymphoproliferative disease which shares clinical characteristics with the indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas. It is commonly classified as a form of plasma cell dyscrasia, similar to other plasma cell dyscrasias that, for example, lead to multiple myeloma. Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia is commonly preceded by two clinically asymptomatic but progressively more pre-malignant phases, IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smoldering Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia."
Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli Infection,"Diarrhea, bloating, fever, vomiting, bacterial infection, intestinal paralysis, borborygmus, abdominal pain","Escherichia coli ( ESH--RIK-ee- KOH-ly; commonly abbreviated E. coli) is a gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms (endotherms). Most E. coli strains are harmless, but pathogenic varieties cause serious food poisoning, septic shock, meningitis, or urinary tract infections in humans.  Unlike normal flora E. coli, the pathogenic varieties produce toxins and other virulence factors that enable them to reside in parts of the body normally not inhabited by E. coli, and to damage host cells.  These pathogenic traits are encoded by virulence genes carried only by the pathogens.


== Introduction ==
E. coli and related bacteria constitute about 0.1% of gut flora, and fecaloral transmission is the major route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease."
Marchiafava-Micheli Syndrome,"Anemia, bleeding, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly","Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, acquired, life-threatening disease of the blood characterized by destruction of red blood cells by the complement system, a part of the body's innate immune system. This destructive process occurs due to deficiency of the red blood cell surface protein DAF, which normally inhibits such immune reactions. Since the complement cascade attacks the red blood cells within the blood vessels of the circulatory system, the red blood cell destruction (hemolysis) is considered an intravascular hemolytic anemia. There is ongoing research into other key features of the disease, such as the high incidence of venous blood clot formation. Research suggests that PNH thrombosis (a blood clot) is caused by both the absence of GPI-anchored complement regulatory proteins (CD55 and CD59) on PNH platelets and the excessive consumption of nitric oxide (NO)."
Hepatic Angiosarcoma,"Weight loss, hepatomegaly, abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, abdominal discomfort, fatigue, nausea, anorexia, hepatosplenomegaly","Liver angiosarcoma also known as angiosarcoma of the liver or hepatic angiosarcoma is a rare and rapidly fatal cancer arising from endothelial that line the blood vessels of the liver. It is a type of angiosarcoma. Although very rare with around 200 cases diagnosed each year, it is still considered the third most common primary liver cancer, making up around 2% of all primary liver cancers. Liver angiosarcoma can be primary (referred to in literature as PHA or primary hepatic angiosarcoma), meaning it arose in the liver, or secondary, meaning the angiosarcoma arose elsewhere and metastasized to the liver. This article covers PHA, however much is also applicable to secondary tumors."
Open Pneumothorax,"Chest wall wounds leading into the thoracic cavity, difficulty breathing, cyanosis, palpitations, shock","A pneumothorax is collection of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. In a minority of cases, a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, and the amount of air in the space between chest wall and lungs increases; this is called a tension pneumothorax. This can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. This leads to a type of shock called obstructive shock, which can be fatal unless reversed."
Pseudomyxoma Peritonei,"Abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting, emaciation, abdominal pain, difficulty in breathing, chest tightness, difficulty turning over, reduced appetite, fatigue, hepatomegaly","Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a clinical condition caused by cancerous cells (mucinous adenocarcinoma) that produce abundant mucin or gelatinous ascites. The tumors cause fibrosis of tissues and impede digestion or organ function, and if left untreated, the tumors and mucin they produce will fill the abdominal cavity.  This will result in compression of organs and will destroy the function of the colon, small intestine, stomach, or other organs.
Prognosis with treatment in many cases is optimistic, but the disease is lethal if untreated, with death occurring via cachexia, bowel obstruction, or other types of complications.
This disease is most commonly caused by an appendiceal primary cancer (cancer of the appendix); mucinous tumors of the ovary have also been implicated, although in most cases ovarian involvement is favored to be a metastasis from an appendiceal or other gastrointestinal source."
Non-ulcer Dyspepsia,"Nausea, acid reflux, diarrhea, bloating","Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a common gastrointestinal disorder defined by symptoms arising from the gastroduodenal region in the absence of an underlying organic disease that could easily explain the symptoms. Characteristic symptoms include epigastric burning, epigastric pain, postprandial fullness, and early satiety. FD was formerly known as non-ulcer dyspepsia, as opposed to ""organic dyspepsia"" with underlying conditions of gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, or cancer.

Theories behind the pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia include gastroduodenal motility, gastroduodenal sensitivity, intestinal microbiota, immune dysfunction, gut-brain axis dysfunction, abnormalities of gastric electrical rhythm, and autonomic nervous system/central nervous system dysregulation."
Acute Appendicitis in Pregnancy,"Lower right abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, appendiceal fibrosis, persistent severe pain in the right upper abdomen that radiates to the right shoulder, vaginal bleeding with abdominal pain during pregnancy, continuous abdominal pain or back pain during pregnancy, painless recurrent vaginal bleeding in late pregnancy or near labor, abdominal pain during pregnancy not caused by pregnancy, late pregnancy abdominal pain, abdominal distension","Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. Symptoms commonly include right lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever and decreased appetite. However, approximately 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms. Severe complications of a ruptured appendix include widespread, painful inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall and sepsis.
Appendicitis is primarily caused by a blockage of the hollow portion in the appendix."
Fibroma,"Inflammation, perianal soft fibroma, papule, weight gain, perianal soft fibroma","Fibromas are benign tumors that are composed of fibrous or connective tissue. They can grow in all organs, arising from mesenchyme  tissue. The term ""fibroblastic"" or ""fibromatous"" is used to describe tumors of the fibrous connective tissue. When the term fibroma is used without modifier, it is usually considered benign, with the term fibrosarcoma reserved for malignant tumors.


== Types ==


=== Hard fibroma ===
The hard fibroma (fibroma durum) consists of many fibres and few cells, e.g."
Symptomatic Epilepsy Syndrome,"Mental and motor developmental delay, hyperactivity disorder, aggressive behavior, destructive behavior","SturgeWeber syndrome, sometimes referred to as encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis, is a rare congenital neurocutaneous disorder (also known as phakomatoses). It is often associated with port-wine stains of the face, glaucoma, seizures, intellectual disability, and ipsilateral leptomeningeal angioma (cerebral malformations and tumors). SturgeWeber syndrome can be classified into three different types. Type 1 includes facial and leptomeningeal angiomas as well as the possibility of glaucoma or choroidal lesions. Normally, only one side of the brain is affected."
Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma,"Eye pain, decreased vision, ipsilateral migraine, nausea, vomiting","Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can lead to damage of the optic nerve. The optic nerve transmits visual information from the eye to the brain. Glaucoma may cause vision loss if left untreated. It has been called the ""silent thief of sight"" because the loss of vision usually occurs slowly over a long period of time. A major risk factor for glaucoma is increased pressure within the eye, known as intraocular pressure (IOP)."
Postmenopausal Endometrial Cancer,"Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding, lower abdominal hidden pain","Endometrial cancer is a cancer that arises from the endometrium (the lining of the uterus or womb). It is the result of the abnormal growth of cells that can invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause."
Pediatric Carbon Monoxide Poisoning,"Headache, flushed face, dizziness, palpitations, chest tightness, nausea and vomiting, fatigue, restlessness, somnolence, urinary and fecal incontinence, hypotension, and sluggish pupillary light reflex","A suicide method is any means by which a person may choose to end their life. Suicide attempts do not always result in death, and a non-fatal suicide attempt can leave the person with serious physical injuries, long-term health problems, or brain damage.
Worldwide, three suicide methods predominate, with the pattern varying in different countries: these are hanging, pesticides, and firearms. Some suicides may be preventable by removing the means. Making common suicide methods less accessible leads to an overall reduction in the number of suicides."
Antepartum Hemorrhage,"Vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, abnormal fetal movements","Antepartum bleeding, also known as antepartum haemorrhage (APH) or prepartum hemorrhage, is genital bleeding during pregnancy after the 24th week of pregnancy up to delivery.
It can be associated with reduced fetal birth weight. Use of aspirin before 16 weeks of pregnancy to prevent pre-eclampsia also appears effective at preventing antepartum bleeding.
In regard to treatment, it should be considered a medical emergency (regardless of whether there is pain), as if it is left untreated it can lead to death of the mother or baby.


== Classification ==
The total amount of blood loss and signs of circulatory shock due to blood determine the severity of the antepartum haemorrhaging."
Hemothorax,"Hemothorax, rapid and weak pulse, shock, coma, abnormal thoracic cage, pneumothorax, chest pain, pleural effusion, cough, hemoptysis, abnormal breathing, and weakened breath sounds","A hemothorax (derived from hemo- [blood] + thorax [chest], plural hemothoraces) is an accumulation of blood within the pleural cavity. The symptoms of a hemothorax may include chest pain and difficulty breathing, while the clinical signs may include reduced breath sounds on the affected side and a rapid heart rate. Hemothoraces are usually caused by an injury, but they may occur spontaneously due to cancer invading the pleural cavity, as a result of a blood clotting disorder, as an unusual manifestation of endometriosis, in response to pneumothorax, or rarely in association with other conditions.
Hemothoraces are usually diagnosed using a chest X-ray, but they can be identified using other forms of imaging including ultrasound, a CT scan, or an MRI. They can be differentiated from other forms of fluid within the pleural cavity by analysing a sample of the fluid, and are defined as having a hematocrit of greater than 50% that of the person's blood. Hemothoraces may be treated by draining the blood using a chest tube."
Connective Tissue Enteritis,"Intestinal perforation, thickening and edema of the intestinal wall, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, rheumatoid arthritis, abdominal discomfort, bloating, borborygmi, loss of appetite, alternating diarrhea and constipation, gastrointestinal dysfunction, gastrointestinal symptoms","Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, abdominal distension, and weight loss. Complications outside of the gastrointestinal tract may include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and fatigue. The skin rashes may be due to infections, as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction may occur as a complication of chronic inflammation, and those with the disease are at greater risk of colon cancer and small bowel cancer."
Hematospermia,Ejaculation during sexual intercourse or nocturnal emissions resulting in the discharge of red semen,"Hematospermia (also known as haematospermia, hemospermia, or haemospermia) is the presence of blood in the ejaculate. It is most often a benign symptom. Among men age 40 or older, hematospermia is a slight predictor of cancer, typically prostate cancer. No specific cause is found in up to 70% of cases.


== Cause ==
Though haematospermia may cause considerable distress to patients, it is often a benign and self-limiting condition caused by infections, particularly in younger patients."
Childhood Acute Disseminated Tuberculosis,"High fever, night sweats, loss of appetite, coughing in children, cough, cyanosis, malnutrition, purpura, headache","Tuberculosis (TB), also known colloquially as the ""white death"", or historically as consumption, is a contagious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteria. Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections show no symptoms, in which case it is known as inactive or latent tuberculosis. A small proportion of latent infections progress to active disease that, if left untreated, can be fatal. Typical symptoms of active TB are chronic cough with blood-containing mucus, fever, night sweats, and weight loss."
Pediatric Nitrate Poisoning,"Cyanosis, purplish tongue, bluish-purple lips, irritability, different degrees of cyanosis on the skin and mucous membranes, fever, abdominal pain, ketoacidosis, coma, headache, abnormal breathing, vomiting blood, and melena","Strychnine poisoning is poisoning induced by strychnine. It can be fatal to humans and other animals and can occur by inhalation, swallowing or absorption through eyes or mouth. It produces some of the most dramatic and painful symptoms of any known toxic reaction, making it quite noticeable and a common choice for assassinations and poison attacks. For this reason, strychnine poisoning is often portrayed in literature and film, such as the murder mysteries written by Agatha Christie.
The probable lethal oral dose in humans is 1.5 to 2 mg/kg."
Stable Angina,"Precordial pain, fatigue, shortness of breath","Angina, also known as angina pectoris, is chest pain or pressure, usually caused by insufficient blood flow to the heart muscle (myocardium). It is most commonly a symptom of coronary artery disease.
Angina is typically the result of partial obstruction or spasm of the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. The main mechanism of coronary artery obstruction is atherosclerosis as part of coronary artery disease. Other causes of angina include abnormal heart rhythms, heart failure and, less commonly, anemia."
Pulmonary Hypoplasia,"Respiratory infections, mild dyspnea, reduced physical endurance, cyanosis, coarse respiratory sounds, delayed growth and development","Pulmonary hypoplasia is an incomplete development of the lungs, resulting in an abnormally low number or small size of bronchopulmonary segments or alveoli.  A congenital malformation, most often occurs secondary to other fetal abnormalities that interfere with normal development of the lungs.  Primary (idiopathic) pulmonary hypoplasia is rare and usually not associated with other maternal or fetal abnormalities.
Incidence of pulmonary hypoplasia ranges from 911 per 10,000 live births and 14 per 10,000 births.  Pulmonary hypoplasia is a relatively common cause of neonatal death."
Polycythemia Vera,"Increased red blood cells, increased white blood cells, increased platelets, hepatosplenomegaly, nosebleeds, gum bleeding, erythromelalgia, dizziness, headache, hypertension","In oncology, polycythemia vera (PV) is an uncommon myeloproliferative neoplasm in which the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells.  The majority of cases are caused by mutations in the JAK2 gene, most commonly resulting in a single amino acid change in its protein product from valine to phenylalanine at position 617.
Most of the health concerns associated with polycythemia vera are caused by the blood being thicker as a result of the increased red blood cells.  It is more common in the elderly and may be symptomatic or asymptomatic.  Common signs and symptoms include itching (pruritus), and severe burning pain in the hands or feet that is usually accompanied by a reddish or bluish coloration of the skin."
Acute Mesenteric Artery Thrombosis or Embolism,"Abdominal pain, vomiting, hematemesis, signs of peritoneal irritation, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, thrombotic vegetations, intraosseous lesions, abdominal distension, paralytic ileus, decreased skin temperature, microthrombosis","Intestinal ischemia is a medical condition in which injury to the large or small intestine occurs due to not enough blood supply. It can come on suddenly, known as acute intestinal ischemia, or gradually, known as chronic intestinal ischemia. The acute form of the disease often presents with sudden severe abdominal pain and is associated with a high risk of death. The chronic form typically presents more gradually with abdominal pain after eating, unintentional weight loss, vomiting, and fear of eating.
Risk factors for acute intestinal ischemia include atrial fibrillation, heart failure, chronic kidney failure, being prone to forming blood clots, and previous myocardial infarction."
Secondary Erythrocytosis due to Severe Liver Disease,"Increased red blood cells, jaundice, anemia, rapid deterioration of liver function, hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding","A paraneoplastic syndrome is a syndrome (a set of signs and symptoms) that is the consequence of a tumor in the body (usually a cancerous one). It is specifically due to the production of chemical signaling molecules (such as hormones or cytokines) by tumor cells or by an immune response against the tumor. Unlike a mass effect, it is not due to the local presence of cancer cells.
Paraneoplastic syndromes are typical among middle-aged to older people, and they most commonly occur with cancers of the lung, breast, ovaries or lymphatic system (a lymphoma). Sometimes, the symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes show before the diagnosis of a malignancy, which has been hypothesized to relate to the disease pathogenesis."
Congenital Constriction Band Syndrome,"The most common sites are fingers, toes, forearms, and lower legs.","Constriction ring syndrome (CRS) is a congenital disorder with unknown cause. Because of the unknown cause there are many different, and sometimes incorrect, names. It is a malformation due to intrauterine bands or rings that produce deep grooves in (most commonly distal) extremities such as fingers and toes. In rare cases the constriction ring can form around other parts of the fetus and cause amputation or even intrauterine death. The anatomy proximal to the site of constriction (or amputation) is developmentally normal."
Esophageal Hemangioma,"Difficulty swallowing, retrosternal pain, discomfort on swallowing","Cherry angioma, also called cherry hemangioma or Campbell de Morgan Spot, is a small bright red dome-shaped bump on the skin. It ranges between 0.5 and 6 mm in diameter and usually several are present, typically on the chest and arms, and increasing in number with age. If scratched, they may bleed.
They are a harmless benign tumour, containing an abnormal proliferation of blood vessels, and have no relationship to cancer. They are the most common kind of angioma, and increase with age, occurring in nearly all adults over 30 years."
Pediatric Renal Vein Thrombosis,"Gross hematuria, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, severe abdominal pain, flank pain, and renal percussion tenderness","Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a type of venous thrombosis involving the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein, most commonly in the legs or pelvis. A minority of DVTs occur in the arms. Symptoms can include pain, swelling, redness, and enlarged veins in the affected area, but some DVTs have no symptoms. 
The most common life-threatening concern with DVT is the potential for a clot to embolize (detach from the veins), travel as an embolus through the right side of the heart, and become lodged in a pulmonary artery that supplies blood to the lungs. This is called a pulmonary embolism (PE)."
Cervical Ectropion,"Increased vaginal discharge, purulent secretion after infection, foul smell, contact bleeding, lumbosacral pain","Cervical ectropion is a condition in which the cells from the 'inside' of the cervical canal, known as glandular cells (or columnar epithelium), are present on the 'outside' of the vaginal portion of the cervix. The cells on the 'outside' of the cervix are typically squamous epithelial cells. Where the two cells meet is called the transformation zone, also known as the stratified squamous epithelium. Cervical ectropion can be grossly indistinguishable from early cervical cancer and must be evaluated by a physician to determine risks and prognosis. It may be found incidentally when a vaginal examination (or pap smear test) is done."
Glioblastoma,"Chills, night sweats, a feeling of chest congestion, a white tongue coating, and thirst.","Glioblastoma, previously known as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), is the most aggressive and most common type of cancer that originates in the brain, and has a very poor prognosis for survival. Initial signs and symptoms of glioblastoma are nonspecific. They may include headaches, personality changes, nausea, and symptoms similar to those of a stroke. Symptoms often worsen rapidly and may progress to unconsciousness.
The cause of most cases of glioblastoma is not known."
Atypical Fibroxanthoma,"Erosion or crusting, nodules","Atypical fibroxanthoma (AFX) of the skin is a low-grade malignancy related to malignant fibrous histiocytoma, which it resembles histologically.:613 Atypical fibroxanthoma manifests as a hard, pink or red papule or nodule that grows over the course of several months and may bleed or ulcerate. They typically occur on the head and neck. Atypical fibroxanthoma is usually asymptomatic.
The exact cause of atypical fibroxanthoma is unknown. They may originate from myofibroblasts."
Post-stroke Hemorrhage,"Headache, syncope, decreased vision, convulsions","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), also known as hemorrhagic stroke, is a sudden bleeding into the tissues of the brain (i.e. the parenchyma), into its ventricles, or into both. An ICH is a type of bleeding within the skull and one kind of stroke (ischemic stroke being the other). Symptoms can vary dramatically depending on the severity (how much blood), acuity (over what timeframe), and location (anatomically) but can include headache, one-sided weakness, numbness, tingling, or paralysis, speech problems, vision or hearing problems, memory loss, attention problems, coordination problems, balance problems, dizziness or lightheadedness or vertigo, nausea/vomiting, seizures, decreased level of consciousness or total loss of consciousness, neck stiffness, and fever.
Hemorrhagic stroke may occur on the background of alterations to the blood vessels in the brain, such as cerebral arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral arteriovenous malformation, brain trauma, brain tumors and an intracranial aneurysm, which can cause intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage."
Diabetes Mellitus,"Weight loss, urine as dark as strong tea, dribbling urination, cloudy urine, thick gelatinous substances in urine","Diabetes, also known as diabetes  mellitus, is a group of common endocrine diseases characterized by sustained high blood sugar levels. Diabetes is due to either the pancreas not producing enough of the hormone insulin, or the cells of the body becoming unresponsive to insulin's effects. Classic symptoms include polydipsia (excessive thirst), polyuria (excessive urination), polyphagia (excessive hunger), weight loss, and blurred vision. If left untreated, the disease can lead to various health complications, including disorders of the cardiovascular system, eye, kidney, and nerves. Diabetes accounts for approximately 4.2 million deaths every year, with an estimated 1.5 million caused by either untreated or poorly treated diabetes."
Cerebral Schistosomiasis,"Convulsions, disturbances of consciousness, infectious fever, paralysis, meningeal irritation signs, neuralgia, headache, epilepsy and epileptiform seizures, sensory disturbances, lymphadenopathy, facial muscle twitching, ataxia","Schistosomiasis, also known as snail fever, bilharzia, and Katayama fever is a disease caused by parasitic flatworms called schistosomes. It affects the urinary tract or the intestines. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, or blood in the urine. Those who have been infected for a long time may experience liver damage, kidney failure, infertility, or bladder cancer. In children, schistosomiasis may cause poor growth and learning difficulties."
Hepatic Neoplasms,"Abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, upper abdominal discomfort, anorexia, dyspepsia, aversion to food, weight loss, lethargy, persistent fever","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer in adults and is currently the most common cause of death in people with cirrhosis. HCC is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.
HCC most commonly occurs in those with chronic liver disease especially those with cirrhosis or fibrosis, which occur in the setting of chronic liver injury and inflammation. HCC is rare in those without chronic liver disease. Chronic liver diseases which greatly increase the risk of HCC include hepatitis infection such as (hepatitis B, C or D), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), alcoholic liver disease, or exposure to toxins such as aflatoxin, or pyrrolizidine alkaloids.:870873 Certain diseases, such as hemochromatosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, markedly increase the risk of developing HCC. The five-year survival in those with HCC is 18%."
Syringocystadenoma Papilliferum,"Increased sweating upon cold exposure, noticeable body odor, lactation disorder, subcutaneous nodules","Syringocystadenoma papilliferum is a rare non-malignant adnexal neoplasm that develops from apocrine or eccrine sweat glands and can be identified histologically by cystic, papillary, and ductal invaginations into the dermis lined by double-layered outer cuboidal and luminal high columnar epithelium and connected to the epidermis.
Lesions have a heterogeneous, non-distinctive appearance that ranges from skin-colored to pink-colored papules or plaques. Typically, lesions form in the head and neck area.
Syringocystadenoma papilliferum can develop de-novo or within a nevus sebaceous. Syringocystadenoma papilliferum tends to be seen in children."
Skull Osteoma,"Cysts, slow growth, visual impairment, mucous cysts, exophthalmos","An osteoma (plural osteomas or less commonly osteomata) is a new piece of bone usually growing as a benign tumour on another piece of bone, typically the skull. When grown on other bone it is known as ""homoplastic osteoma""; on other tissue it is called ""heteroplastic osteoma"".
Osteoma represents the most common benign neoplasm of the nose and paranasal sinuses. The cause of osteomas is uncertain, but commonly accepted theories propose embryologic, traumatic, or infectious causes. They are present in Gardner's syndrome."
Orbital Rhabdomyosarcoma,"Proptosis and orbital mass, incomplete eyelid closure with conjunctival edema and hyperemia, visual field defect","Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a highly aggressive form of cancer that develops from mesenchymal cells that have failed to fully differentiate into myocytes of skeletal muscle. Cells of the tumor are identified as rhabdomyoblasts.
The four subtypes are embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, and spindle-cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma. Embryonal and alveolar are the main groups, and these types are the most common soft tissue sarcomas of childhood and adolescence. The pleomorphic type is usually found in adults."
Geographic Tongue,"Dry mouth, tongue numbness, diminished taste","Geographic tongue, also known by several other terms, is a condition of the mucous membrane of the tongue, usually on the dorsal surface. It is a common condition, affecting approximately 23% of the general population. It is characterized by areas of smooth, red depapillation (loss of lingual papillae) which migrate over time. The name comes from the map-like appearance of the tongue, with the patches resembling the islands of an archipelago. The cause is unknown, but the condition is entirely benign (importantly, it does not represent oral cancer), and there is no curative treatment."
Breast Fibrosarcoma,"Painless breast lump, long duration of illness, slow growth","Zoledronic acid, also known as zoledronate and sold under the brand name Zometa among others, by Novartis among others, is a medication used to treat a number of bone diseases. These include osteoporosis, high blood calcium due to cancer, bone breakdown due to cancer,  Paget's disease of bone and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). It is given by injection into a vein.
Common side effects include fever, joint pain, high blood pressure, diarrhea, and feeling tired. Serious side effects may include kidney problems, low blood calcium, and osteonecrosis of the jaw."
Pharyngeal Diphtheria,"High fever or no rise in temperature, irritability, rapid breathing, pallor, vomiting, fatigue, poor appetite, headache","Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. Symptoms include fever, weakness and headache. Usually this begins one to seven days after exposure. There are three forms of plague, each affecting a different part of the body and causing associated symptoms. Pneumonic plague infects the lungs, causing shortness of breath, coughing and chest pain; bubonic plague affects the lymph nodes, making them swell; and septicemic plague infects the blood and can cause tissues to turn black and die."
Eccrine Porocarcinoma,"Reduced or absent sweating in the lower body, increased sweating after getting cold, hyperhidrosis in palms and soles, tubular-shaped nails, perception of foul sweat odor","Porocarcinoma (PCA) (also termed malignant poroma, eccrine porocarcinoma, and malignant eccrine poroma) is a rare form of skin cancer that develops in eccrine sweat glands, i.e. the body's widely distributed major type of sweat glands, as opposed to the apocrine sweat glands which are located primarily in the armpits and perineal area. This cancer typically develops in individuals as a single cutaneous tumor in the intraepidermal spiral part (termed the acrosyringium) of these sweat glands' ducts (i.e. channels) at or near to where they open on the skin's surface. PCA tumors are classified as one form of the cutaneous adnexal tumors; in a study of 2,205 cases, PCA was the most common (11.8%) form of these tumors."
Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome,"Recurrent pneumonia, sepsis, varicella-like rash, hemolytic anemia","Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) is a rare autosomal recessive congenital disorder causing chromosomal instability, probably as a result of a defect in the double Holliday junction DNA repair mechanism and/or the synthesis dependent strand annealing mechanism for repairing double strand breaks in DNA (see Homologous recombination).
NBS1 codes for a protein (nibrin) that has two major functions: (1) to stop the cell cycle in the S phase, when there are errors in the cell DNA (2) to interact with FANCD2 that can activate the BRCA1/BRCA2 pathway of DNA repair. This explains why mutations in the NBS1 gene lead to higher levels of cancer (see Fanconi anemia, Cockayne syndrome.)
The name derives from the Dutch city Nijmegen, where the condition was first described.
Most people with NBS have West Slavic origins. The largest number of them live in Poland."
Bloom Syndrome,"Slow growth, weight loss, dwarfism present at birth, café au lait spots, excessive facial hair, shortening of the lower limbs, inward turn of the feet, hypospadias","Bloom syndrome (often abbreviated as BS in literature) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by short stature, predisposition to the development of cancer, and genomic instability. BS is caused by mutations in the BLM gene which is a member of the RecQ DNA helicase family. Mutations in genes encoding other members of this family, namely WRN and RECQL4, are associated with the clinical entities Werner syndrome and RothmundThomson syndrome, respectively. More broadly, Bloom syndrome is a member of a class of clinical entities that are characterized by chromosomal instability, genomic instability, or both, and cancer predisposition.
Cells from a person with Bloom syndrome exhibit a striking genomic instability that includes excessive crossovers between homologous chromosomes and sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs)."
Vaginal Melanoma,"Irregular vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, vaginal mass",Vaginal melanoma is a rare malignancy that originates from melanocytes in the vaginal epithelium. It is also known as a melanocytic tumor or as a malignant melanoma. It is aggressive and infrequently cured. The median overall survival is 16 months. Vaginal melanoma accounts 5.5% of all vaginal cancers and only 1% of all melanomas diagnosed in women.
Pancreatic Encephalopathy Syndrome,"Upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, decreased blood pressure, elevated urine amylase, restlessness, hallucinations, orientation disturbances, delirium, tremors, cranial nerve paralysis","Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is an altered level of consciousness as a result of liver failure. Its onset may be gradual or sudden. Other symptoms may include movement problems, changes in mood, or changes in personality. In the advanced stages, it can result in a coma.
Hepatic encephalopathy can occur in those with acute or chronic liver disease."
Acute Heart Failure,"Syncope, apnea, cyanosis, angina, shock, coma, palpitations, heart failure, reduced cardiac output, cerebral ischemia, loss of consciousness, orthopnea","Heart failure (HF), also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), is a syndrome caused by an impairment in the heart's ability to fill with and pump blood.
Although symptoms vary based on which side of the heart is affected, HF typically presents with shortness of breath, excessive fatigue, and bilateral leg swelling. The severity of the heart failure is mainly decided based on ejection fraction and also measured by the severity of symptoms. Other conditions that have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver disease, anemia, and thyroid disease.
Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excessive alcohol consumption, infection, and cardiomyopathy."
Necrobiosis Lipoidica Diabeticorum,Large plaques of scleroderma-like patches appear on the anterior tibia.,"Necrobiosis Lipoidica is a rare, chronic skin condition predominantly associated with diabetes mellitus (known as necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum or NLD). It can occur in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis or without any underlying conditions (idiopathic) and can also be displayed in patients with obesity, hypertension, celiac disease, and metabolic syndrome. About a quarter of Necrobiosis Lipoidica is associated with diabetes mellitus.
The broader overarching definition of necrobiosis is a gradual physiological death of a cell. It can be caused by basophilia, erythema, or a tumor."
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS),"Orthopneic breathing, cyanosis, chest deformity, diminished breath sounds, wheezing, abnormal sweating","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a type of respiratory failure characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs. Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnea), rapid breathing (tachypnea), and bluish skin coloration (cyanosis). For those who survive, a decreased quality of life is common.
Causes may include sepsis, pancreatitis, trauma, pneumonia, and aspiration. The underlying mechanism involves diffuse injury to cells which form the barrier of the microscopic air sacs of the lungs, surfactant dysfunction, activation of the immune system, and dysfunction of the body's regulation of blood clotting."
Sheehan's Syndrome,"Amenorrhea, pallor, edema","Sheehan's syndrome, also known as postpartum pituitary gland necrosis, occurs when the pituitary gland is damaged due to significant blood loss and hypovolemic shock (ischemic necrosis) or stroke, originally described during or after childbirth leading to decreased functioning of the pituitary gland (hypopituitarism). Classically, in the milder partial form, the mother is unable to breastfeed her baby, due to failure of the pituitary to secrete the hormone prolactin, and also has no more periods, because FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) and LH (Luteinising Hormone) are not secreted. Although postmenopausal, the mother with this milder form of Sheehan's syndrome does not experience hot flushes, because the pituitary fails to secrete FSH (high levels of FSH, secreted by the pituitary in healthy postmenopausal women is an attempt to trigger ovulation, and these high levels of FSH cause hot the flushes). The failure to breastfeed and amenorrhea no more periods, were seen as the syndrome (a collection of symptoms), but we now view Sheehan's as the pituitary failing to secrete 1-5 of the 9 hormones that it normally produces (the anterior (front) lobe of the pituitary produces FSH, LH, prolactin, ACTH (Adreno-cortico-trophic hormone),TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) and GH (Growth Hormone); the posterior (the lobe at the back) pituitary produces ADH (Anti-Diuretic Hormone) and Oxytocin, i.e. the pituitary is involved in the regulation of many hormones."
Cystic Hyperplasia of the Breast,"Unilateral or bilateral breast swelling or tenderness, multiple breast lumps, worsened by anger, mental stress, or fatigue","Fibrocystic breast changes is a condition of the breasts where there may be pain, breast cysts, and breast masses. The breasts may be described as ""lumpy"" or ""doughy"". Symptoms may worsen during certain parts of the menstrual cycle due to hormonal stimulation. These are normal breast changes, not associated with cancer.
Risk factors include an early age at first menstrual period and either having children at a late age or not at all."
Old Myocardial Infarction,"Angina, chest tightness, palpitations, shortness of breath","A diagnosis of myocardial infarction is created by integrating the history of the presenting illness and physical examination with electrocardiogram findings and cardiac markers (blood tests for heart muscle cell damage). A coronary angiogram allows visualization of narrowings or obstructions on the heart vessels, and therapeutic measures can follow immediately. At autopsy, a pathologist can diagnose a myocardial infarction based on anatomopathological findings.
A chest radiograph and routine blood tests may indicate complications or precipitating causes and are often performed upon arrival to an emergency department. New regional wall motion abnormalities on an echocardiogram are also suggestive of a myocardial infarction."
Contact Dermatitis,"Erythema and swelling of the skin, itching of the skin, skin tenderness, papules, pustules, fever, nausea and vomiting, dermatitis, skin pain, ulcers","Contact dermatitis is a type of acute or chronic inflammation of the skin caused by exposure to chemical or physical agents. Symptoms of contact dermatitis can include itchy or dry skin, a red rash, bumps, blisters, or swelling. These rashes are not contagious or life-threatening, but can be very uncomfortable.
Contact dermatitis results from either exposure to allergens (allergic contact dermatitis), or irritants (irritant contact dermatitis). Allergic contact dermatitis involves a delayed type of hypersensitivity and previous exposure to an allergen to produce a reaction."
Scorpion Sting,"Pain, swelling at the sting site, high fever, nausea and vomiting, fainting","A scorpion sting is an injury caused by the stinger of a scorpion resulting in the medical condition known as scorpionism, which may vary in severity. The anatomical part of the scorpion that delivers the sting is called a ""telson"". In typical cases, scorpion stings usually result in pain, paresthesia, and variable swelling. In serious cases, scorpion stings may involve the envenomation of humans by toxic scorpions, which may result in extreme pain, serious illness, or even death depending on the toxicity of the venom.
Most scorpion stings range in severity from minor swelling to medically significant lesions, with only a few able to cause severe allergic, neurotic or necrotic reactions."
Noise-induced Hearing Loss,Auditory fatigue that gradually recovers after leaving the noisy environment,"Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a hearing impairment resulting from exposure to loud sound. People may have a loss of perception of a narrow range of frequencies or impaired perception of sound including sensitivity to sound or ringing in the ears. When exposure to hazards such as noise occur at work and is associated with hearing loss, it is referred to as occupational hearing loss.
Hearing may deteriorate gradually from chronic and repeated noise exposure (such as to loud music or background noise) or suddenly from exposure to impulse noise, which is a short high intensity noise (such as a gunshot or airhorn). In both types, loud sound overstimulates delicate hearing cells, leading to the permanent injury or death of the cells."
Vaginal Angiosarcoma,"Difficulty urinating, hard lumps, vaginal bleeding","The following is a list of cancer types. Cancer is a group of diseases that involve abnormal increases in the number of cells, with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors or lumps are cancerous; benign tumors are not classified as being cancer because they do not spread to other parts of the body. There are over 100 different known cancers that affect humans.
Cancers are often described by the body part that they originated in."
Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"Squamous cell carcinoma, ulcers, nodules","Squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC),  also known as epidermoid carcinoma, comprises a number of different types of cancer that begin in squamous cells. These cells form on the surface of the skin, on the lining of hollow organs in the body, and on the lining of the respiratory and digestive tracts.
The squamous-cell carcinomas of different body sites can show differences in their presented symptoms, natural history, prognosis, and response to treatment.


== By body location ==
Human papillomavirus infection has been associated with SCCs of the oropharynx, lung, fingers, and anogenital region.


=== Head and neck cancer ===

About 90% of cases of head and neck cancer (cancer of the mouth, nasal cavity, nasopharynx, throat and associated structures) are due to SCC.


=== Skin ===
Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma is the second most common skin cancer, accounting for over 1 million cases in the United States each year."
Gingival Cancer,"Gingival swelling, gingival pain, periodontal pocket formation, oral ulcers, toothache, difficulty opening the mouth, numbness in the lower lip, swollen neck lymph nodes","Oral cancer, also known as oral cavity cancer, tongue cancer or mouth cancer, is a cancer of the lining of the lips, mouth, or upper throat. In the mouth, it most commonly starts as a painless red or white patch, that thickens, gets ulcerated and continues to grow. When on the lips, it commonly looks like a persistent crusting ulcer that does not heal, and slowly grows. Other symptoms may include difficult or painful swallowing, new lumps or bumps in the neck, a swelling in the mouth, or a feeling of numbness in the mouth or lips.
Risk factors include tobacco and alcohol use."
Chronic Granulocytic Leukemia,"Low fever, fatigue, excessive sweating, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, bleeding","Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), also known as chronic myeloid leukemia, is a cancer of the white blood cells. It is a form of leukemia characterized by the increased and unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of these cells in the blood. CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) and their precursors is found; characteristic increase in basophils is clinically relevant. It is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome.
CML is largely treated with targeted drugs called tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which have led to dramatically improved long-term survival rates since 2001."
Pneumonic Plague,"High fever with chills, coughing up blood, rapid breathing, swollen lymph nodes, chest pain, vomiting, diarrhea, enlarged liver, respiratory failure, enlarged spleen, productive cough, nausea, and vomiting","Pneumonic plague is a severe lung infection caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. Symptoms include fever, headache, shortness of breath, chest pain, and coughing. They typically start about three to seven days after exposure. It is one of three forms of plague, the other two being septicemic plague and bubonic plague.
The pneumonic form may occur following an initial bubonic or septicemic plague infection."
Pediatric Malnutrition,"Constipation, restlessness, muscle atrophy, lethargy, anorexia, dry hair, pale complexion, pallor","Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is a type of fluid replacement used to prevent and treat dehydration, especially due to diarrhea. It involves drinking water with modest amounts of sugar and salts, specifically sodium and potassium. Oral rehydration therapy can also be given by a nasogastric tube. Therapy can include the use of zinc supplements to reduce the duration of diarrhea in infants and children under the age of 5. Use of oral rehydration therapy has been estimated to decrease the risk of death from diarrhea by up to 93%."
Neonatal Pneumonia,"Newborns exhibit rapid or labored breathing after resuscitation or birth, accompanied by cyanosis, groaning, unstable body temperature, poor response, and progressively developing rales.","Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) refers to pneumonia (any of several lung diseases) contracted by a person outside of the healthcare system. In contrast, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is seen in patients who have recently visited a hospital or who live in long-term care facilities. CAP is common, affecting people of all ages, and its symptoms occur as a result of oxygen-absorbing areas of the lung (alveoli) filling with fluid. This inhibits lung function, causing dyspnea, fever, chest pains and cough.
CAP, the most common type of pneumonia, is a leading cause of illness and death worldwide."
Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD),"Fatigue, enlarged liver and spleen, pain in the liver area, indigestion","Fatty liver disease (FLD), also known as hepatic steatosis and steatotic liver disease (SLD), is a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver. Often there are no or few symptoms. Occasionally there may be tiredness or pain in the upper right side of the abdomen. Complications may include cirrhosis, liver cancer, and esophageal varices.
The main subtypes of fatty liver disease are metabolic dysfunctionassociated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, formerly ""non-alcoholic fatty liver disease"" (NAFLD)) and alcoholic liver disease (ALD), with the category ""metabolic and alcohol associated liver disease"" (metALD) describing an overlap of the two."
Pyelonephritis,"Frequent urination, urgency, dysuria, cloudy urine, lower back pain, nocturia, loss of appetite","Pyelonephritis  is inflammation of the kidney, typically due to a bacterial infection. Symptoms most often include fever and flank tenderness. Other symptoms may include nausea, burning with urination, and frequent urination. Complications may include pus around the kidney, sepsis, or kidney failure.
It is typically due to a bacterial infection, most commonly Escherichia coli."
Mucin-producing papillary adenocarcinoma,"Nipple discharge, breast swelling, nipple enlargement","Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is a type of tumor that can occur within the cells of the pancreatic duct. IPMN tumors produce mucus, and this mucus can form pancreatic cysts. Although intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms are benign tumors, they can progress to pancreatic cancer. As such IPMN is viewed as a precancerous condition. Once an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm has been found, the management options include close monitoring and pre-emptive surgery."
Visceral Injury,"Chest pain, cough, abdominal pain, hypotension","The spleen (from Anglo-Norman  espleen, ult. from Ancient Greek  , spln) is an organ found in almost all vertebrates. Similar in structure to a large lymph node, it acts primarily as a blood filter.
The spleen plays important roles in regard to red blood cells (erythrocytes) and the immune system. It removes old red blood cells and holds a reserve of blood, which can be valuable in case of hemorrhagic shock, and also recycles iron."
Nonbacterial Prostatitis,"Frequent urination, urgent urination, painful urination, discomfort or burning sensation during urination, urinary irritation, difficulty urinating, abdominal pain, back pain","Chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS), previously known as chronic nonbacterial prostatitis, is long-term pelvic pain and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) without evidence of a bacterial infection. It affects about 26% of men. Together with IC/BPS, it makes up urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS).
The cause is unknown. Diagnosis involves ruling out other potential causes of the symptoms such as bacterial prostatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, overactive bladder, and cancer."
Meningeal Carcinomatosis,"Cerebral hemorrhage, nausea and vomiting, slow response, headache, increased intracranial pressure, damage around the aqueduct, hearing loss, feeling of heaviness in the head and lightness in the feet, ventricular compression shift, deep headache, signs of meningeal irritation, visual impairment","Leptomeningeal cancer is a rare complication of cancer in which the disease spreads from the original tumor site to the meninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord. This leads to an inflammatory response, hence the alternative names neoplastic meningitis (NM), malignant meningitis, or carcinomatous meningitis. The term leptomeningeal (from the Greek lepto, meaning 'fine' or 'slight') describes the thin meninges, the arachnoid and the pia mater, between which the cerebrospinal fluid is located. The disorder was originally reported by Eberth in 1870. It is also known as leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, leptomeningeal disease (LMD), leptomeningeal metastasis, meningeal metastasis and meningeal carcinomatosis."
Spinous Process Fracture,"Tenderness over the spinous process, limited movement of the head and neck","A bone fracture (abbreviated FRX or Fx, Fx, or #) is a medical condition in which there is a partial or complete break in the continuity of any bone in the body. In more severe cases, the bone may be broken into several fragments, known as a comminuted fracture. An open fracture (or compound fracture) is a bone fracture where the broken bone breaks through the skin. 
A bone fracture may be the result of high force impact or stress, or a minimal trauma injury as a result of certain medical conditions that weaken the bones, such as osteoporosis, osteopenia, bone cancer, or osteogenesis imperfecta, where the fracture is then properly termed a pathologic fracture. Most bone fractures require urgent medical attention to prevent further injury."
Chordoma,"Headache, nasal obstruction with purulent or bloody discharge, urinary and fecal incontinence, lung metastasis, pain in the sacrococcygeal region, constipation, paraplegia, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea","Chordoma is a rare slow-growing neoplasm (cancer) that arises from cellular remnants of the notochord in the bones of the skull base and spine. The evidence for the notochordal origin of chordoma is the location of the tumors (along the neuraxis), the similar immunohistochemical staining patterns, expression of brachyury, and the demonstration that notochordal cells are preferentially left behind in the clivus and sacrococcygeal regions when the remainder of the notochord regresses during fetal life.
In layman's terms, chordoma is a type of bone cancer, and is classified as a sarcoma. Chordomas are sometimes mistakenly referred to as a brain, brainstem or spinal cord tumors due to their location near those critical structures, but they are not derived from nervous tissue.


== Presentation ==

Chordomas can arise from bone in the skull base and anywhere along the spine."
Angina Pectoris,"Pain, chest tightness, hidden chest pain, squeezing-like colic pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, pale complexion, and cold sweat","Angina, also known as angina pectoris, is chest pain or pressure, usually caused by insufficient blood flow to the heart muscle (myocardium). It is most commonly a symptom of coronary artery disease.
Angina is typically the result of partial obstruction or spasm of the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. The main mechanism of coronary artery obstruction is atherosclerosis as part of coronary artery disease. Other causes of angina include abnormal heart rhythms, heart failure and, less commonly, anemia."
Severe ovarian edema,"Abdominal pain or pelvic pain, accompanied by abdominal bloating","Lymphedema, also known as lymphoedema and lymphatic edema, is a condition of localized swelling caused by a compromised lymphatic system. The lymphatic system functions as a critical portion of the body's immune system and returns interstitial fluid to the bloodstream.
Lymphedema is most frequently a complication of cancer treatment or parasitic infections, but it can also be seen in a number of genetic disorders. Tissues with lymphedema are at high risk of infection because the lymphatic system has been compromised.
Though incurable and progressive, a number of treatments may improve symptoms."
"Skin diseases caused by petroleum, coal tar, shale oil and their distillation products","Skin lesions manifest as redness, papules, vesicles, with sensations of itching and pain, possibly accompanied by dizziness, headache, fatigue, thirst, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, cough, chest tightness, and palpitations","Creosote is a category of carbonaceous chemicals formed by the distillation of various tars and pyrolysis of plant-derived material, such as wood, or fossil fuel. They are typically used as preservatives or antiseptics.
Some creosote types were used historically as a treatment for components of seagoing and outdoor wood structures to prevent rot (e.g., bridgework and railroad ties, see image). Samples may be found commonly inside chimney flues, where the coal or wood burns under variable conditions, producing soot and tarry smoke. Creosotes are the principal chemicals responsible for the stability, scent, and flavor characteristic of smoked meat; the name is derived from Greek   (kreas) 'meat' and   (str) 'preserver'."
Sturge-Weber Syndrome,"Seizures, port-wine stains, hemiparesis, hemiatrophy, glaucoma, and proptosis with vision impairment.","SturgeWeber syndrome, sometimes referred to as encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis, is a rare congenital neurocutaneous disorder (also known as phakomatoses). It is often associated with port-wine stains of the face, glaucoma, seizures, intellectual disability, and ipsilateral leptomeningeal angioma (cerebral malformations and tumors). SturgeWeber syndrome can be classified into three different types. Type 1 includes facial and leptomeningeal angiomas as well as the possibility of glaucoma or choroidal lesions. Normally, only one side of the brain is affected."
Protein-Energy Malnutrition,"Emaciation, fatigue, pallor","Proteinenergy undernutrition (PEU), once called proteinenergy malnutrition (PEM), is a form of malnutrition that is defined as a range of conditions arising from coincident lack of dietary protein and/or energy (calories) in varying proportions. The condition has mild, moderate, and severe degrees.

Types include:

Kwashiorkor (protein malnutrition predominant)
Marasmus (deficiency in calorie intake)
Marasmic kwashiorkor (marked protein deficiency and marked calorie insufficiency signs present, sometimes referred to as the most severe form of malnutrition)
PEU is fairly common worldwide in both children and adults and accounts for about 250,000 deaths annually. In the industrialized world, PEM is predominantly seen in hospitals, is associated with disease, or is often found in the elderly.
Note that PEU may be secondary to other conditions such as chronic renal disease or cancer cachexia in which protein energy wasting (PEW) may occur."
Pediatric Behcet's Disease,"Oral ulcers, recurrent genital ulcers, keratitis, mucosal damage, perineal ulcers, vulvar ulcers, loss of appetite, eye pain, fatigue, damage to mouth, eyes, genitals, joint pain, intracranial hypertension","Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, abdominal distension, and weight loss. Complications outside of the gastrointestinal tract may include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and fatigue. The skin rashes may be due to infections, as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction may occur as a complication of chronic inflammation, and those with the disease are at greater risk of colon cancer and small bowel cancer."
Spinal Cord Ischemia,"Intermittent claudication, weakness in the lower limbs, paraplegia","Spinal cord stroke is a rare type of stroke with compromised blood flow to any region of spinal cord owing to occlusion or bleeding, leading to irreversible neuronal death. It can be classified into two types, ischaemia and haemorrhage, in which the former accounts for 86% of all cases, a pattern similar to cerebral stroke. The disease is either arisen spontaneously from aortic illnesses or postoperatively. It deprives patients of motor function or sensory function, and sometimes both. Infarction usually occurs in regions perfused by anterior spinal artery, which spans the anterior two-thirds of spinal cord."
Lichen Sclerosus,"Itching, dyspareunia, and a burning sensation in the vulvar area","Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease, of unknown cause, which can affect any body part of any person, but has a strong preference for the genitals (penis, vulva), and is also known as balanitis xerotica obliterans when it affects the penis. Lichen sclerosus is not contagious. There is a well-documented increase of skin cancer risk in LS, potentially improvable with treatment. LS in adult age women is normally incurable, although treatment can lessen its effects, and it often gets progressively worse if not treated properly. Most males with mild or intermediate disease, restricted to foreskin or glans, can be cured by either medical or surgical treatment."
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) in Children,"Nodules, convulsions, epilepsy and epileptic episodes, cognitive impairments, vascular malformations, intracranial hypertension, papules, dementia, hydrocephalus","Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare multisystem autosomal dominant genetic disease that causes non-cancerous tumours to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, liver, eyes, lungs and skin. A combination of symptoms may include seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delay, behavioral problems, skin abnormalities, lung disease, and kidney disease.
TSC is caused by a mutation of either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which code for the proteins hamartin and tuberin, respectively, with TSC2 mutations accounting for the majority and tending to cause more severe symptoms. These proteins act as tumor growth suppressors, agents that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation.
Prognosis is highly variable and depends on the symptoms, but life expectancy is normal for many."
Simple Breast Hyperplasia,"Breast distension pain, breast lumps, pain related to menstrual cycle","Mastectomy is the medical term for the surgical removal of one or both breasts, partially or completely. A mastectomy is usually carried out to treat breast cancer. In some cases, women believed to be at high risk of breast cancer choose to have the operation as a preventive measure. Alternatively, some women can choose to have a wide local excision, also known as a lumpectomy, an operation in which a small volume of breast tissue containing the tumor and a surrounding margin of healthy tissue is removed to conserve the breast. Both mastectomy and lumpectomy are referred to as ""local therapies"" for breast cancer, targeting the area of the tumor, as opposed to systemic therapies, such as chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or immunotherapy."
Turcot Syndrome,"Hematochezia, nausea, abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anemia, headache, dizziness","Mismatch repair cancer syndrome (MMRCS) is a cancer syndrome associated with biallelic DNA mismatch repair mutations. It is also known as Turcot syndrome (after Jacques Turcot, who described the condition in 1959) and by several other names.
In MMRCS, neoplasia typically occurs in both the gut and the central nervous system (CNS). In the large intestine, multiple colonic polyps develop; in the CNS, brain tumors.


== Presentation ==


== Genetics ==
Under the name constitutional mismatch repair-deficiency (CMMR-D), it has been mapped to MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 or PMS2."
Type 2 Diabetes,"Polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, weight loss","Type 2 diabetes (T2D), formerly known as adult-onset diabetes, is a form of diabetes mellitus that is characterized by high blood sugar, insulin resistance, and relative lack of insulin. Common symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue and unexplained weight loss. Other symptoms include increased hunger, having a sensation of pins and needles, and sores (wounds) that heal slowly. Symptoms often develop slowly. Long-term complications from high blood sugar include heart disease, stroke, diabetic retinopathy, which can result in blindness, kidney failure, and poor blood flow in the lower limbs, which may lead to amputations."
Sturge-Weber Syndrome,"Seizures, port-wine stains, hemiparesis, hemiatrophy, glaucoma, and proptosis with vision impairment.","SturgeWeber syndrome, sometimes referred to as encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis, is a rare congenital neurocutaneous disorder (also known as phakomatoses). It is often associated with port-wine stains of the face, glaucoma, seizures, intellectual disability, and ipsilateral leptomeningeal angioma (cerebral malformations and tumors). SturgeWeber syndrome can be classified into three different types. Type 1 includes facial and leptomeningeal angiomas as well as the possibility of glaucoma or choroidal lesions. Normally, only one side of the brain is affected."
Sphenoid Wing Meningioma with Ocular Manifestations,"Sluggish response to light, Superior Orbital Fissure Syndrome, Temporal Bone Protuberance, Hemianopia, Hemiparesis, Triad Syndrome, Ptosis, Visual Field Defect","Phakomatoses, also known as neurocutaneous syndromes, are a group of multisystemic diseases that most prominently affect structures primarily derived from the ectoderm such as the central nervous system, skin and eyes. The majority of phakomatoses are single-gene disorders that may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked pattern. Presentations may vary dramatically between patients with the same particular syndrome due to mosaicism, variable expressivity, and penetrance.
Many phakomatoses are caused by mutations which alter functioning of the RASmitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway that regulates cellular growth, differentiation, proliferation and death. This results in a tendency for individuals with these mutations to develop various types of benign or malignant tumors depending on the particular mutation."
Persistent Vegetative State (PVS),"Coma, loss of consciousness, cognitive dysfunction, lack of emotional response, loss of cognitive and neurological functions","A vegetative state (VS)  or post-coma unresponsiveness (PCU) is a disorder of consciousness in which patients with severe brain damage are in a state of partial arousal rather than true awareness. After four weeks in a vegetative state, the patient is classified as being in a persistent vegetative state (PVS). This diagnosis is classified as a permanent vegetative state some months (three in the US and six in the UK) after a non-traumatic brain injury or one year after a traumatic injury. The term unresponsive wakefulness syndrome may be used alternatively, as ""vegetative state"" has some negative connotations among the public. It is occasionally also called Apallic syndrome or Apallisches syndrome, borrowings from German, primarily in European or older sources."
Toxic Shock Syndrome,"Persistent fever accompanied by rash, sore throat, widespread erythematous infiltrative lesions with desquamation, syncope, shock, headache, anemia, and maculopapular rash","Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a condition caused by bacterial toxins. Symptoms may include fever, rash, skin peeling, and low blood pressure. There may also be symptoms related to the specific underlying infection such as mastitis, osteomyelitis, necrotising fasciitis, or pneumonia.
TSS is typically caused by bacteria of the Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus type, though others may also be involved. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is sometimes referred to as toxic-shock-like syndrome (TSLS)."
Renal Injury,"Urinary extravasation, elevated hematocrit, hematuria, low back pain, renal abscess, hypertension","Kidney failure, also known as renal failure or end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is a medical condition in which the kidneys can no longer adequately filter waste products from the blood, functioning at less than 15% of normal levels. Kidney failure is classified as either acute kidney failure, which develops rapidly and may resolve; and chronic kidney failure, which develops slowly and can often be irreversible. Symptoms may include leg swelling, feeling tired, vomiting, loss of appetite, and confusion. Complications of acute and chronic failure include uremia, hyperkalemia, and volume overload. Complications of chronic failure also include heart disease, high blood pressure, and anaemia."
Alcoholic Fatty Liver,"Right upper abdominal distension and pain, loss of appetite, fatigue, jaundice, spider nevi, palmar erythema, or asymptomatic","Fatty liver disease (FLD), also known as hepatic steatosis and steatotic liver disease (SLD), is a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver. Often there are no or few symptoms. Occasionally there may be tiredness or pain in the upper right side of the abdomen. Complications may include cirrhosis, liver cancer, and esophageal varices.
The main subtypes of fatty liver disease are metabolic dysfunctionassociated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, formerly ""non-alcoholic fatty liver disease"" (NAFLD)) and alcoholic liver disease (ALD), with the category ""metabolic and alcohol associated liver disease"" (metALD) describing an overlap of the two."
Aortic Regurgitation,"Palpitations, dyspnea, chest pain, dizziness, transient syncope, faint heart sounds, pistol shot femoral artery sounds, cyanosis, systolic and diastolic murmurs, systolic thrill, wide pulse pressure, heart failure","Aortic regurgitation (AR), also known as aortic insufficiency (AI), is the leaking of the aortic valve of the heart that causes blood to flow in the reverse direction during ventricular diastole, from the aorta into the left ventricle. As a consequence, the cardiac muscle is forced to work harder than normal.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms of aortic regurgitation are similar to those of heart failure and include the following:

Dyspnea on exertion
Orthopnea
Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
Palpitations
Angina pectoris
Cyanosis (in acute cases)


== Causes ==
In terms of the cause of aortic regurgitation, is often due to the aortic root dilation (annuloaortic ectasia), which is idiopathic in over 80% of cases, but otherwise may result from aging, syphilitic aortitis, osteogenesis imperfecta, aortic dissection, Behet's disease, reactive arthritis and systemic hypertension. Aortic root dilation is the most common cause of aortic regurgitation in developed countries. Additionally, aortic regurgitation has been linked to the use of some medications, specifically medications containing fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine isomers and dopamine agonists."
Vaginal adenocarcinoma,Irregular vaginal bleeding and discharge,"Vaginal cancer is an extraordinarily rare form of cancer that develops in the tissue of the vagina. Primary vaginal cancer originates from the vaginal tissue  most frequently squamous cell carcinoma, but primary vaginal adenocarcinoma, sarcoma, and melanoma have also been reported  while secondary vaginal cancer involves the metastasis of a cancer that originated in a different part of the body. Secondary vaginal cancer is more common. Signs of vaginal cancer may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, dysuria, tenesmus, or pelvic pain, though as many as 20% of women diagnosed with vaginal cancer are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Vaginal cancer occurs more frequently in women over age 50, and the mean age of diagnosis of vaginal cancer is 60 years."
Colorectal Injury,"Gastrointestinal distension, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, disappearance of bowel sounds, peritonitis","Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as bowel cancer, colon cancer, or rectal cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine). Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, abdominal pain and fatigue. Most colorectal cancers are due to lifestyle factors and genetic disorders. Risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red meat, processed meat, and alcohol."
Non-lactational Periareolar Fistula,"Recurrent infections, ulcers, abscesses, nipple retraction","Also called Zuska's disease (only nonpuerperal case), subareolar abscess is a subcutaneous abscess of the breast tissue beneath the areola of the nipple. It is a frequently aseptic inflammation and has been associated with squamous metaplasia of lactiferous ducts.
The term is usually understood to include breast abscesses located in the retroareolar region or the periareolar region but not those located in the periphery of the breast.
Subareolar abscess can develop both during lactation or extrapuerperal, the abscess is often flaring up and down with repeated fistulation.


== Pathophysiology ==
90% of cases are smokers, however only a very small fraction of smokers appear to develop this lesion."
Disorders of consciousness,"Unresponsiveness, convulsions, frothing at the mouth","Disorders of consciousness are medical conditions that inhibit consciousness. Some define disorders of consciousness as any change from complete self-awareness to inhibited or absent self-awareness and arousal. This category generally includes minimally conscious state and persistent vegetative state, but sometimes also includes the less severe locked-in syndrome and more severe but rare chronic coma. Differential diagnosis of these disorders is an active area of biomedical research. Finally, brain death results in an irreversible disruption of consciousness."
Pneumocystis Pneumonia (PCP),"Shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, cyanosis, cough, recurrent pneumonia, malnutrition, nodules, rales, pleural effusion, respiratory failure, chest pain, abnormal breathing","Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), also known as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), is a form of pneumonia that is caused by the yeast-like fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii.
Pneumocystis specimens are commonly found in the lungs of healthy people although it is usually not a cause for disease. However, they are a source of opportunistic infection and can cause lung infections in people with a weak immune system or other predisposing health conditions. PCP is seen in people with HIV/AIDS (who account for 30-40% of PCP cases), those using medications that suppress the immune system, and people with cancer, autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, and chronic lung disease.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms may develop over several days or weeks and may include: shortness of breath and/or difficulty breathing (of gradual onset), fever, dry/non-productive cough, weight loss, night sweats, chills, and fatigue."
Spinal Vascular Disease,"Pain of varying degrees related to the lesion site, paraplegia, paralysis of the lower limbs, loss of sensation, urinary and fecal incontinence","Spinal cord stroke is a rare type of stroke with compromised blood flow to any region of spinal cord owing to occlusion or bleeding, leading to irreversible neuronal death. It can be classified into two types, ischaemia and haemorrhage, in which the former accounts for 86% of all cases, a pattern similar to cerebral stroke. The disease is either arisen spontaneously from aortic illnesses or postoperatively. It deprives patients of motor function or sensory function, and sometimes both. Infarction usually occurs in regions perfused by anterior spinal artery, which spans the anterior two-thirds of spinal cord."
Stress Ulcer,"Abdominal pain, vomiting of blood or coffee-ground-like material, melena","A stress ulcer is a single or multiple mucosal defect usually caused by physiological (not psychological) stress which can become complicated by upper gastrointestinal bleeding. These ulcers can be caused by shock, sepsis, trauma or other conditions and are found in patients with chronic illnesses. These ulcers are a significant issue in patients in critical and intensive care.
It was previously thought that peptic ulcers (a different type of ulcer) could be caused by psychological stress but this was proven false with the discovery of Helicobacter pylori and its role in the formation of this ulcer. Stress ulcers are a different condition and are formed by different mechanisms."
Sepsis in the Elderly,"Swelling and pain in large joints, limited mobility, chills, high fever, rash","Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
This initial stage of sepsis is followed by suppression of the immune system. Common signs and symptoms include fever, increased heart rate, increased breathing rate, and confusion. There may also be symptoms related to a specific infection, such as a cough with pneumonia, or painful urination with a kidney infection. The very young, old, and people with a weakened immune system may not have any symptoms that are specific to their infection, and their body temperature may be low or normal instead of constituting a fever."
Primary Malignant Lymphoma of the Small Intestine,"Abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting, abdominal mass, bloody stool, abdominal hemorrhage, abdominal pain, diarrhea","Lymphoma is a group of blood and lymph tumors that develop from lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). The name typically refers to just the cancerous versions rather than all such tumours. Signs and symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, drenching sweats, unintended weight loss, itching, and constantly feeling tired. The enlarged lymph nodes are usually painless. The sweats are most common at night."
Vulvar Lymphangioma,"Nodules, difficulty breathing, sensation of ants crawling","A vulvar disease is a particular abnormal, pathological condition that affects part or all of the vulva. Several pathologies are defined. Some can be prevented by vulvovaginal health maintenance.


== Vulvar cancer ==

Vulvar cancer accounts for about 5% of all gynecological cancers and typically affects women in later life. Five-year survival rates in the United States are around 70%."
Chronic Heart Failure,"Post-activity shortness of breath, exertional dyspnea, hepatomegaly, lower limb edema, cardiac failure, coma, shock, abnormal breathing, arrhythmia, syncope, vertigo","Heart failure (HF), also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), is a syndrome caused by an impairment in the heart's ability to fill with and pump blood.
Although symptoms vary based on which side of the heart is affected, HF typically presents with shortness of breath, excessive fatigue, and bilateral leg swelling. The severity of the heart failure is mainly decided based on ejection fraction and also measured by the severity of symptoms. Other conditions that have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver disease, anemia, and thyroid disease.
Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excessive alcohol consumption, infection, and cardiomyopathy."
Thymic carcinoma,"Hot flashes, night sweats, chest pain, cough","Thymic carcinoma, or type C thymoma, is a malignancy of the thymus. It is a rare cancer that is often diagnosed at advanced stages. Recurrence following treatment is common, and thymic carcinoma is associated with a poor prognosis.


== Epidemiology ==
A study examining cases of thymic carcinoma in the United States from 2001 to 2015 found a peak incidence from 70 to 74 years old and a higher incidence in males compared to females. After thymoma, thymic carcinoma is the second most common type of thymus cancer."
Hypertensive Cerebral Hemorrhage,"Limited motor function, headache, dizziness","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), also known as hemorrhagic stroke, is a sudden bleeding into the tissues of the brain (i.e. the parenchyma), into its ventricles, or into both. An ICH is a type of bleeding within the skull and one kind of stroke (ischemic stroke being the other). Symptoms can vary dramatically depending on the severity (how much blood), acuity (over what timeframe), and location (anatomically) but can include headache, one-sided weakness, numbness, tingling, or paralysis, speech problems, vision or hearing problems, memory loss, attention problems, coordination problems, balance problems, dizziness or lightheadedness or vertigo, nausea/vomiting, seizures, decreased level of consciousness or total loss of consciousness, neck stiffness, and fever.
Hemorrhagic stroke may occur on the background of alterations to the blood vessels in the brain, such as cerebral arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral arteriovenous malformation, brain trauma, brain tumors and an intracranial aneurysm, which can cause intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage."
Actinic Keratosis,Epidermal keratinization,"Actinic keratosis (AK), sometimes called solar keratosis or senile keratosis, is a pre-cancerous area of thick, scaly, or crusty skin. Actinic keratosis is a disorder (-osis) of epidermal keratinocytes that is induced by ultraviolet (UV) light exposure (actin-). 
These growths are more common in fair-skinned people and those who are frequently in the sun. They are believed to form when skin gets damaged by UV radiation from the sun or indoor tanning beds, usually over the course of decades. Given their pre-cancerous nature, if left untreated, they may turn into a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma."
Renal Vascular Anomalies and Compression,"Hypertension, Hematuria, Proteinuria","Vascular disease is a class of diseases of the vessels of the circulatory system in the body, including blood vessels  the arteries and veins, and the lymphatic vessels. Vascular disease is a subgroup of cardiovascular disease. Disorders in this vast network of blood  and lymph vessels can cause a range of health problems that can sometimes become severe, and fatal. Coronary heart disease for example, is the leading cause of death for men and women in the United States.


== Types ==
There are several types of vascular disease, including venous diseases, and arterial diseases, and signs and symptoms vary depending on the disease."
Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS),"Dyspnea, fatigue, palpitations, oliguria, back pain","Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is altered organ function in an acutely ill patient requiring immediate medical intervention.
There are different stages of organ dysfunction for certain different organs, both in acute and in chronic onset, whether or not there are one or more organs affected. Each stage of dysfunction (whether it be the heart, lung, liver, or kidney) has defined parameters, in terms of laboratory values based on blood and other tests, as to what it is (each of these organs' levels of failure is divided into stage I, II, III, IV, and V). The word ""failure"" is commonly used to refer to the later stages, especially IV and V, when artificial support usually becomes necessary to sustain life; the damage may or may not be fully or partially reversible.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome can trigger a variety of symptoms throughout the body."
Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA),"Cyanosis, clubbing of fingers and toes, heart murmur, patent ductus arteriosus, bounding pulse, capillary pulsation","Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a medical condition in which the ductus arteriosus fails to close after birth: this allows a portion of oxygenated blood from the left heart to flow back to the lungs from the aorta, which has a higher blood pressure, to the pulmonary artery, which has a lower blood pressure. Symptoms are uncommon at birth and shortly thereafter, but later in the first year of life there is often the onset of an increased work of breathing and failure to gain weight at a normal rate. With time, an uncorrected PDA usually leads to pulmonary hypertension followed by right-sided heart failure.
The ductus arteriosus is a fetal blood vessel that normally closes soon after birth. This closure is caused by vessel constriction immediately after birth as circulation changes occur, followed by the occlusion of the vessels lumen in the following days."
Breast Cancer in the Elderly,"In the early stages, a lump the size of a broad bean can be felt within the breast, which is relatively hard, movable, with intermittent concealed pain, dull pain, and stabbing pain, breast lump, breast pain","Breast cancer screening is the medical screening of asymptomatic, apparently healthy women for breast cancer in an attempt to achieve an earlier diagnosis. The assumption is that early detection will improve outcomes.  A number of screening tests have been employed, including clinical and self breast exams, mammography, genetic screening, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.
A clinical or self breast exam involves feeling the breast for lumps or other abnormalities.  Medical evidence, however, does not support its use in women with a typical risk for breast cancer."
Cranial Trauma,"Headache, swelling pain, dizziness, inability to concentrate, depression, slow response","A head injury is any injury that results in trauma to the skull or brain. The terms traumatic brain injury and head injury are often used interchangeably in the medical literature. Because head injuries cover such a broad scope of injuries, there are many causesincluding accidents, falls, physical assault, or traffic accidentsthat can cause head injuries.
The number of new cases is 1.7 million in the United States each year, with about 3% of these incidents leading to death. Adults have head injuries more frequently than any age group resulting from falls, motor vehicle crashes, colliding or being struck by an object, or assaults."
Pediatric Malnutrition,"Constipation, restlessness, muscle atrophy, lethargy, anorexia, dry hair, pale complexion, pallor","Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is a type of fluid replacement used to prevent and treat dehydration, especially due to diarrhea. It involves drinking water with modest amounts of sugar and salts, specifically sodium and potassium. Oral rehydration therapy can also be given by a nasogastric tube. Therapy can include the use of zinc supplements to reduce the duration of diarrhea in infants and children under the age of 5. Use of oral rehydration therapy has been estimated to decrease the risk of death from diarrhea by up to 93%."
Ameloblastoma,"Mild pain, localized progressive swelling, muscle atrophy","Ameloblastoma is a rare, benign or cancerous tumor of odontogenic epithelium (ameloblasts, or outside portion, of the teeth during development) much more commonly appearing in the lower jaw than the upper jaw. It was recognized in 1827 by Cusack. This type of odontogenic neoplasm was designated as an adamantinoma in 1885 by the French physician Louis-Charles Malassez. It was finally renamed to the modern name ameloblastoma in 1930 by Ivey and Churchill.
While these tumors are rarely malignant or metastatic (that is, they rarely spread to other parts of the body), and progress slowly, the resulting lesions can cause severe abnormalities of the face and jaw leading to severe disfiguration."
Chest Wall Soft Tissue Tumor,"Presence of a mass on the chest wall, some patients may experience pain, and if the mass becomes infected, it can result in redness, erosion, and even rupture with pus discharge.","Desmoplastic small-round-cell tumor (DSRCT) is an aggressive and rare cancer that primarily occurs as masses in the abdomen. Other areas affected may include the lymph nodes, the lining of the abdomen, diaphragm, spleen, liver, chest wall, skull, spinal cord, large intestine, small intestine, bladder, brain, lungs, testicles, ovaries, and the pelvis. Reported sites of metastatic spread include the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, brain, skull, and bones. It is characterized by the EWS-WT1 fusion protein.
The tumor is classified as a soft tissue sarcoma and a small round blue cell tumor."
Post-traumatic Cerebral Fat Embolism,"Confusion, coma, hemiplegia, seizures, aphasia, high fever, tachycardia, hypotension, coughing, respiratory distress, cyanosis","Fat embolism syndrome occurs when fat enters the blood stream (fat embolism) and results in symptoms. Symptoms generally begin within a day. This may include a petechial rash, decreased level of consciousness, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms may include fever and decreased urine output. The risk of death is about 10%."
Pediatric Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases,"Recurrent infections, eczema, hair loss, pustules, decreased immunity, thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic anemia, febrile infections, infectious rhinitis, eye infections, bacterial infections, lung infections","Immunodeficiency, also known as immunocompromise, is a state in which the immune system's ability to fight infectious diseases and cancer is compromised or entirely absent. Most cases are acquired (""secondary"") due to extrinsic factors that affect the patient's immune system. Examples of these extrinsic factors include HIV infection and environmental factors, such as nutrition. Immunocompromisation may also be due to genetic diseases/flaws such as SCID.
In clinical settings, immunosuppression by some drugs, such as steroids, can either be an adverse effect or the intended purpose of the treatment. Examples of such use is in organ transplant surgery as an anti-rejection measure and in patients with an overactive immune system, as in autoimmune diseases."
Cerebral Cavernous Malformations,"Seizures and seizure-like episodes, headaches, calcification, recurrent bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage","Cavernous hemangioma, also called cavernous angioma, venous malformation, or cavernoma, is a type of venous malformation due to endothelial dysmorphogenesis from a lesion which is present at birth. A cavernoma in the brain is called a cerebral cavernous malformation or CCM.  Despite its designation as a hemangioma, a cavernous hemangioma is a benign (but not harmless) condition, not a malignant tumor, as it does not display endothelial hyperplasia. The abnormal tissue causes a slowing of blood flow through the cavities, or ""caverns"". The blood vessels do not form the necessary junctions with surrounding cells, and the structural support from the smooth muscle is hindered, causing leakage into the surrounding tissue. It is the leakage of blood (hemorrhage) that causes a variety of symptoms known to be associated with the condition."
Pharyngeal Mixed Tumor,"The tumor often has a complete capsule, is relatively hard, with a few being softer or cystic, sensation of a foreign body, discomfort in the pharynx, difficulty swallowing, and slurred speech","Oral cancer, also known as oral cavity cancer, tongue cancer or mouth cancer, is a cancer of the lining of the lips, mouth, or upper throat. In the mouth, it most commonly starts as a painless red or white patch, that thickens, gets ulcerated and continues to grow. When on the lips, it commonly looks like a persistent crusting ulcer that does not heal, and slowly grows. Other symptoms may include difficult or painful swallowing, new lumps or bumps in the neck, a swelling in the mouth, or a feeling of numbness in the mouth or lips.
Risk factors include tobacco and alcohol use."
Malaria Nephropathy,"Hypertension, proteinuria, hematuria, edema, pleural effusion, ascites accompanied by liver and spleen enlargement and anemia, persistent fever","Malarial nephropathy is kidney failure attributed to malarial infection.  Among various complications due to infection, renal-related disorders are often the most life-threatening.  Including malaria-induced renal lesions, infection may lead to both tubulointerstitial damage and glomerulonephritis.  In addition, malarial acute kidney failure has emerged as a serious problem due to its high mortality rate in non-immune adult patients.


== Mechanism ==
Due to the complex malarial syndrome, there are many pathogenic interactions leading to acute renal failure, such as hypovolemia, intravascular hemolysis and disseminated intravascular coagulation."
Diffuse Mesothelioma,"Hypoglycemia, cough, chest pain, fever","Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium). The area most commonly affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding each testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly."
Microcystic Adenocarcinoma,"Pale yellow skin, plaques, nodules, skin lesions","A histopathologic diagnosis of prostate cancer is the discernment of whether there is a cancer in the prostate, as well as specifying any subdiagnosis of prostate cancer if possible. The histopathologic subdiagnosis of prostate cancer has implications for the possibility and methodology of any subsequent Gleason scoring. The most common histopathological subdiagnosis of prostate cancer is acinar adenocarcinoma, constituting 93% of prostate cancers. The most common form of acinar adenocarcinoma, in turn, is ""adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified"", also termed conventional, or usual acinar adenocarcinoma.


== Sampling ==

The main sources of tissue sampling are prostatectomy and prostate biopsy."
Acute Infective Endocarditis,"High fever with chills, diaphoresis, petechiae, leukocytosis, anemia, migratory abscesses, right heart failure, myocardial abscess, febrile infection, coughing, expectoration, hemoptysis","Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner surface of the heart (endocardium), usually the valves. Signs and symptoms may include fever, small areas of bleeding into the skin, heart murmur, feeling tired, and low red blood cell count. Complications may include backward blood flow in the heart, heart failure  the heart struggling to pump a sufficient amount of blood to meet the body's needs, abnormal electrical conduction in the heart, stroke, and kidney failure.
The cause is typically a bacterial infection and less commonly a fungal infection. Risk factors include valvular heart disease, including rheumatic disease, congenital heart disease, artificial valves, hemodialysis, intravenous drug use, and electronic pacemakers."
Small Intestinal Tumors,"Abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, loss of appetite, tarry stools, colic, emaciation, anemia, and abdominal mass.","Small intestine cancer is a cancer of the small intestine. It is relatively rare compared to other gastrointestinal malignancies such as gastric cancer (stomach cancer) and colorectal cancer.
Small intestine cancer can be subdivided into duodenal cancer (the first part of the small intestine) and cancer of the jejunum and ileum (the latter two parts of the small intestine). Duodenal cancer has more in common with stomach cancer, while cancer of the jejunum and ileum have more in common with colorectal cancer. Five-year survival rates are 65%."
Liposarcoma,"Pain in the liver area, fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, jaundice","Liposarcomas are the most common subtype of soft tissue sarcomas, accounting for at least 20% of all sarcomas in adults. Soft tissue sarcomas are rare neoplasms with over 150 different histological subtypes or forms. Liposarcomas arise from the precursor lipoblasts of the adipocytes (i.e. fat cells) in adipose (i.e. fat) tissues."
Blue Nevus,"Commonly found on the skin of the face, the extensor surfaces of the limbs, particularly the dorsum of the hands and feet, as well as the waist and buttocks. Blue nevi are usually solitary but can also be multiple. They appear as blue, slate blue, or blue-black papules, nodules, or plaques, with diameters ranging from a few millimeters to several centimeters.","A blue nevus is a type of coloured mole, typically a  single well-defined blue-black bump. 
The blue colour is caused by the pigment being deep in the skin.
Diagnosis is by visualisation and dermoscopy. A biopsy is sometimes performed, or the whole lesion surgically removed. The outcome is generally good but there is a small chance of cancerous transformation."
Pancreatic Cyst,"Constipation, ascites, jaundice, abdominal pain accompanied by nausea, vomiting, epigastric fullness, recurrent fever, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal mass, epigastric mass and abdominal distension, abdominal pain","A pancreatic cyst is a fluid filled sac within the pancreas. The prevalence of pancreatic cysts is 2-15% based on imaging studies, but the prevalence may be as high as 50% based on autopsy series. Most pancreatic cysts are benign and the risk of malignancy (pancreatic cancer) is 0.5-1.5%. Pancreatic pseudocysts and serous cystadenomas (which collectively account for 15-25% of all pancreatic cysts) are considered benign pancreatic cysts with a risk of malignancy of 0%. 
Causes range from benign to malignant."
Hypereosinophilic Syndrome,"Fever, fatigue, night sweats, anemia, persistent cough, chest pain, itching skin, weight loss, dyspnea","Hypereosinophilic syndrome  is a disease characterized by a persistently elevated eosinophil count ( 1500 eosinophils/mm) in the blood for at least six months without any recognizable cause, with involvement of either the heart, nervous system, or bone marrow.
Hypereosinophilic syndrome can manifest in many different ways from nonspecific symptoms and fatigue to neurological impairment and endomyocardial fibrosis, which may be fatal.
There are three different variants of hypereosinophilic syndrome, myeloproliferative, lymphocytic, and idiopathic.
HES is a diagnosis of exclusion, after clonal eosinophilia (such as FIP1L1-PDGFRA-fusion induced hypereosinophelia and leukemia) and reactive eosinophilia (in response to infection, autoimmune disease, atopy, hypoadrenalism, tropical eosinophilia, or cancer) have been ruled out.
There are some associations with chronic eosinophilic leukemia as it shows similar characteristics and genetic defects."
Fungal Enteritis,"Diarrhea, abdominal pain, purulent bloody stool, hematochezia, low fever, vomiting, hematemesis and melena, fever, dyspepsia","Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, abdominal distension, and weight loss. Complications outside of the gastrointestinal tract may include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and fatigue. The skin rashes may be due to infections, as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction may occur as a complication of chronic inflammation, and those with the disease are at greater risk of colon cancer and small bowel cancer."
Acute Radiation Thyroiditis,"Pain, tenderness, neck swelling","Radiation-induced thyroiditis is a form of painful, acute thyroiditis resulting from radioactive therapy to treat hyperthyroidism or from radiation to treat head and neck cancer or lymphoma. It affects 1% of those who have received radioactive iodine (I-131) therapy for Graves' Disease, typically presenting between 5 and 10 days after the procedure. Stored T3 and T4 are released as rapid destruction of thyroid tissue occurs which results in pain, tenderness, and exacerbation of hyperthyroidism."
Acute Leukemia,"Fever, anemia, bleeding, infection, weight loss, joint pain, intracranial hemorrhage","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal cells that build up in the bone marrow and blood and interfere with normal blood cell production. Symptoms may include feeling tired, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. Occasionally, spread may occur to the brain, skin, or gums. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly, and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.
Risk factors include getting older, being male, smoking, previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy, myelodysplastic syndrome, and exposure to the chemical benzene."
Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss Syndrome),"Erythema-like rash, joint pain, unexplained fever","Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly known as  allergic granulomatosis, is an extremely rare autoimmune condition that causes inflammation of small and medium-sized blood vessels (vasculitis) in persons with a history of airway allergic hypersensitivity (atopy).
It usually manifests in three stages. The early (prodromal) stage is marked by airway inflammation; almost all patients experience asthma and/or allergic rhinitis. The second stage is characterized by abnormally high numbers of eosinophils (hypereosinophilia), which causes tissue damage, most commonly to the lungs and the digestive tract. The third stage consists of vasculitis, which can eventually lead to cell death and can be life-threatening."
Actinic Keratosis,Epidermal keratinization,"Actinic keratosis (AK), sometimes called solar keratosis or senile keratosis, is a pre-cancerous area of thick, scaly, or crusty skin. Actinic keratosis is a disorder (-osis) of epidermal keratinocytes that is induced by ultraviolet (UV) light exposure (actin-). 
These growths are more common in fair-skinned people and those who are frequently in the sun. They are believed to form when skin gets damaged by UV radiation from the sun or indoor tanning beds, usually over the course of decades. Given their pre-cancerous nature, if left untreated, they may turn into a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma."
Lomentospora prolificans infection,"Ulcers, cysts, abscesses, skin granulomas","Lomentospora prolificans is an emerging opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes a wide variety of infections in immunologically normal and immunosuppressed people and animals. It is resistant to most antifungal drugs and infections are often fatal. Drugs targeting the Class II dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) proteins of L. prolificans, Scedosporium, Aspergillus and other deadly moulds are the basis for at least one new therapy, Olorofim, which is currently in phase 2b clinical trials and has received breakthrough status by FDA. For information on all DHODH proteins, please see Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.


== History ==
The genus Lomentospora was erected by G. Hennebert and B.G. Desai in 1974 to accommodate a culture obtained from greenhouse soil originating from a forest in Belgium. The fungus, which they named Lomentospora prolificans, was thought incorrectly to be related to the genus Beauveria - a group of insect-pathogenic soil fungi affiliated with the order Hypocreales."
Granulocytic Sarcoma,"Localized pain, swelling, skin redness, joint effusion, pain and restricted movement in joints, low-grade fever, fatigue, general malaise","A myeloid sarcoma (chloroma, granulocytic sarcoma,:744 extramedullary myeloid tumor) is a solid tumor composed of immature white blood cells called myeloblasts. A chloroma is an extramedullary manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia; in other words, it is a solid collection of leukemic cells occurring outside of the bone marrow.


== Types ==


=== In acute leukemia ===
Chloromas are rare; exact estimates of their prevalence are lacking, but they are uncommonly seen even by physicians specializing in the treatment of leukemia. Chloromas may be somewhat more common in patients with the following disease features:

FrenchAmericanBritish (FAB) classification class M2
WHO Classification (2016 revision) is a separate entity under the ""Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and related neoplasms""
those with specific cytogenetic abnormalities (e.g. t(8;21) or inv(16))
those whose myeloblasts express T-cell surface markers, CD13, or CD14
those with high peripheral white blood cell counts
However, even in patients with the above risk factors, chloroma remains an uncommon complication of acute myeloid leukemia."
Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy,"Infantile spasms, abnormal psychomotor development in children, mental disorders, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, intellectual developmental delay, speech development delay, hemiparesis, clonic-tonic seizures","Ohtahara syndrome (OS), also known as Early Infantile Developmental & Epileptic Encephalopathy (EIDEE) is a progressive epileptic encephalopathy. The syndrome is outwardly characterized by tonic spasms and partial seizures within the first few months of life, and receives its more elaborate name from the pattern of burst activity on an electroencephalogram (EEG).  It is an extremely debilitating progressive neurological disorder, involving intractable seizures and severe intellectual disabilities. No single cause has been identified, although in many cases structural brain damage is present.


== Presentation ==
Ohtahara syndrome is rare and the earliest-appearing age-related epileptic encephalopathy, with seizure onset occurring within the first three months of life, and often in the first ten days."
Vitamin C Deficiency,"fatigue, general weakness, depressive mood, suspiciousness, debility, anorexia, malnutrition, pallor, mild anemia, gingival swelling, bleeding","Scurvy is a deficiency disease (state of malnutrition) resulting from a lack of vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Early symptoms of deficiency include weakness, fatigue, and sore arms and legs. Without treatment, decreased red blood cells, gum disease, changes to hair, and bleeding from the skin may occur. As scurvy worsens, there can be poor wound healing, personality changes, and finally death from infection or bleeding.
It takes at least a month of little to no vitamin C in the diet before symptoms occur."
Congenital X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia,"Recurrent bacterial infections, associated arthritis","X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a rare genetic disorder discovered in 1952 that affects the body's ability to fight infection. As the form of agammaglobulinemia that is X-linked, it is much more common in males. In people with XLA, the white blood cell formation process does not generate mature B cells, which manifests as a complete or near-complete lack of proteins called gamma globulins, including antibodies, in their bloodstream. B cells are part of the immune system and normally manufacture antibodies (also called immunoglobulins), which defend the body from infections by sustaining a humoral immunity response. Patients with untreated XLA are prone to develop serious and even fatal infections."
Water Intoxication,"Headache, vomiting, drowsiness, decreased respiration and heartbeat, which can lead to severe cases of coma, seizures, and papilloedema.","Water intoxication, also known as water poisoning, hyperhydration, overhydration, or water toxemia, is a potentially fatal disturbance in brain functions that can result when the normal balance of electrolytes in the body is pushed outside safe limits by excessive water intake.
Under normal circumstances, accidentally consuming too much water is exceptionally rare. Most deaths related to water intoxication in healthy individuals have resulted either from water-drinking contests, in which individuals attempt to consume large amounts of water, or from long bouts of exercise during which excessive amounts of fluid were consumed. In addition, water cure, a method of torture in which the victim is forced to consume excessive amounts of water, can cause water intoxication.
Water, like any other substance, can be considered a poison when over-consumed in a brief period."
Atrial Fibrillation,"Palpitations, anxiety, chest discomfort, irregular heartbeat, polyuria, pulse deficit, inability to count pulse rate per minute, syncope, ventricular fibrillation, high metabolic syndrome, atrioventricular dissociation, chronic atrial fibrillation","Atrial fibrillation (AF, AFib or A-fib) is an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) characterized by rapid and irregular beating of the atrial chambers of the heart. It often begins as short periods of abnormal beating, which become longer or continuous over time.  It may also start as other forms of arrhythmia such as atrial flutter that then transform into AF.
Episodes can be asymptomatic. Symptomatic episodes may involve heart palpitations, fainting, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, or shortness of breath. Atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, dementia, and stroke."

Hydrocele Testis,"Scrotal sagging, swelling discomfort, and traction pain","A hydrocele testis is an accumulation of clear fluid within the cavum vaginale, the potential space between the layers of the tunica vaginalis of the testicle. It is the most common form of hydrocele and is often referred to simply as a ""hydrocele"". A primary hydrocele testis causes a painless enlargement in the scrotum on the affected side and is thought to be due to the defective absorption of fluid secreted between the two layers of the tunica vaginalis (investing membrane). A secondary hydrocele is secondary to either inflammation or a neoplasm in the testis.
A hydrocele testis usually occurs on one side, but can also affect both sides."
Basal Cell Carcinoma,"Headache, ulceration, nodules, erythematous rash, eczema, pain","Basal-cell carcinoma (BCC), also known as basal-cell cancer, basalioma or rodent ulcer, is the most common type of skin cancer. It often appears as a painless raised area of skin, which may be shiny with small blood vessels running over it. It may also present as a raised area with ulceration. Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it, but it is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death.
Risk factors include exposure to ultraviolet light, having lighter skin, radiation therapy, long-term exposure to arsenic and poor immune-system function."
Aortic Valve Stenosis,"heart failure, cardiac murmur, hypotension, cyanosis, myocardial hypertrophy, left heart failure, dyspnea, feeding difficulties, breathlessness, pallor, systolic murmur, fatigue","Aortic stenosis (AS or AoS) is the narrowing  of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aorta begins), such that problems result. It may occur at the aortic valve as well as above and below this level. It typically gets worse over time. Symptoms often come on gradually with a decreased ability to exercise often occurring first. If heart failure, loss of consciousness, or heart related chest pain occur due to AS the outcomes are worse."
Iatrogenic Bile Duct Injury,"Jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, nausea","Biliary injury (bile duct injury) is the traumatic damage of the bile ducts. It is most commonly an iatrogenic complication of cholecystectomy (surgical removal of the gallbladder), but can also be caused by other operations or by major trauma. The risk of biliary injury is higher during laparoscopic cholecystectomy than during open cholecystectomy. Biliary injury may lead to several complications and may even cause death if not diagnosed in time and managed properly. Ideally biliary injury should be managed at a center with facilities and expertise in endoscopy, radiology and surgery."
Exfoliation Syndrome,"Conjunctival congestion, nystagmus, elevated intraocular pressure, loss of pigment","Pseudoexfoliation syndrome, often abbreviated as PEX and sometimes as PES or PXS, is an aging-related systemic disease manifesting itself primarily in the eyes which is characterized by the accumulation of microscopic granular amyloid-like protein fibers. Its cause is unknown, although there is speculation that there may be a genetic basis. It is more prevalent in women than men, and in persons past the age of seventy. Its prevalence in different human populations varies; for example, it is prevalent in Scandinavia. The buildup of protein clumps can block normal drainage of the eye fluid called the aqueous humor and can cause, in turn, a buildup of pressure leading to glaucoma and loss of vision (pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, exfoliation glaucoma)."
Perianal Tumor,"Hematochezia, inguinal lymphadenopathy, anal fissure, leukoplakia, anal pruritus","A perianal gland tumor is a type of tumor found near the anus in dogs that arises from specialized glandular tissue found in the perineum. It is also known as a hepatoid tumor because of the similarity in cell shape to hepatocytes (liver cells). It is most commonly seen in intact dogs and is the third most common tumor type in intact male dogs. There are two types of perianal gland tumors, perianal gland adenomas, which are benign, and perianal gland adenocarcinomas, which are malignant. Both have receptors for testosterone."
Basal Ganglia Hematoma,"Patients with a clear history of trauma or hypertension may experience headache, nausea, vomiting, hemiplegia on one side, sensory impairment on one side, mild consciousness disturbances after emotional excitement. If combined with intracranial hemorrhage in other locations, severe consciousness disturbances such as restlessness and coma may occur.","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), also known as hemorrhagic stroke, is a sudden bleeding into the tissues of the brain (i.e. the parenchyma), into its ventricles, or into both. An ICH is a type of bleeding within the skull and one kind of stroke (ischemic stroke being the other). Symptoms can vary dramatically depending on the severity (how much blood), acuity (over what timeframe), and location (anatomically) but can include headache, one-sided weakness, numbness, tingling, or paralysis, speech problems, vision or hearing problems, memory loss, attention problems, coordination problems, balance problems, dizziness or lightheadedness or vertigo, nausea/vomiting, seizures, decreased level of consciousness or total loss of consciousness, neck stiffness, and fever.
Hemorrhagic stroke may occur on the background of alterations to the blood vessels in the brain, such as cerebral arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral arteriovenous malformation, brain trauma, brain tumors and an intracranial aneurysm, which can cause intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage."
Cervical fracture with dislocation,"Neck pain, restricted movement, cervical muscle spasms, widespread tenderness in the neck, severe localized symptoms, signs of paralysis of varying degrees in most cases except for a few fortunate ones due to spinal cord injury, and a higher proportion of complete spinal cord injuries.","A cervical fracture, commonly called a broken neck, is a fracture of any of the seven cervical vertebrae in the neck. Examples of common causes in humans are traffic collisions and diving into shallow water. Abnormal movement of neck bones or pieces of bone can cause a spinal cord injury, resulting in loss of sensation, paralysis, or usually death soon thereafter (~1 min.), primarily via compromising neurological supply to the respiratory muscles and innervation to the heart.


== Causes ==

Considerable force is needed to cause a cervical fracture. Vehicle collisions and falls are common causes."
Tension Pneumothorax,"Chest tightness, shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing","A pneumothorax is collection of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. In a minority of cases, a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, and the amount of air in the space between chest wall and lungs increases; this is called a tension pneumothorax. This can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. This leads to a type of shock called obstructive shock, which can be fatal unless reversed."
Decompression Sickness,"Skin itching, limb pain, aseptic bone necrosis, paraplegia, urinary and fecal incontinence, joint pain, abdominal pain, headache, dermatomal contracture, increased pulmonary water content","Decompression sickness (DCS; also called divers' disease, the bends, aerobullosis, and caisson disease) is a medical condition caused by dissolved gases emerging from solution as bubbles inside the body tissues during decompression. DCS most commonly occurs during or soon after a decompression ascent from underwater diving, but can also result from other causes of depressurisation, such as emerging from a caisson, decompression from saturation, flying in an unpressurised aircraft at high altitude, and extravehicular activity from spacecraft. DCS and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as decompression illness.
Since bubbles can form in or migrate to any part of the body, DCS can produce many symptoms, and its effects may vary from joint pain and rashes to paralysis and death. DCS often causes air bubbles to settle in major joints like knees or elbows, causing individuals to bend over in excruciating pain, hence its common name, the bends."
Acute Cerebrovascular Disease,"Hemiplegia, Aphasia, Vertigo, Ataxia, Cough due to aspiration","Cerebrovascular disease includes a variety of medical conditions that affect the blood vessels of the brain and the cerebral circulation. Arteries supplying oxygen and nutrients to the brain are often damaged or deformed in these disorders. The most common presentation of cerebrovascular disease is an ischemic stroke or mini-stroke and sometimes a hemorrhagic stroke. Hypertension (high blood pressure) is the most important contributing risk factor for stroke and cerebrovascular diseases as it can change the structure of blood vessels and result in atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis narrows blood vessels in the brain, resulting in decreased cerebral perfusion."
Childhood Lead Poisoning,"Nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, a metallic sweet taste in the mouth, drooling, diarrhea, black stools, seizures and seizure-like episodes, headache, dizziness, palpitations, hepatomegaly, and convulsions.","Lead poisoning, also known as plumbism and saturnism, is a type of metal poisoning caused by lead in the body. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, irritability, memory problems, infertility, numbness and tingling in the hands and feet. It causes almost 10% of intellectual disability of otherwise unknown cause and can result in behavioral problems. Some of the effects are permanent. In severe cases, anemia, seizures, coma, or death may occur."
Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors,"Jaundice, petechiae, erythema, weakness, hyperhidrosis, tremors, hyperactivity, anxiety, fatigue, headache, dizziness, disorientation, seizures, confusion, weight loss, diarrhea","Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PanNETs, PETs, or PNETs), often referred to as ""islet cell tumours"", or ""pancreatic endocrine tumours"" are neuroendocrine neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous system within the pancreas.
PanNETs are a type of neuroendocrine tumor, representing about one-third of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). Many PanNETs are benign, while some are malignant. Aggressive PanNET tumors have traditionally been termed ""islet cell carcinoma"".
PanNETs are quite distinct from the usual form of pancreatic cancer, the majority of which are adenocarcinomas, which arise in the exocrine pancreas."
Vertebrobasilar Insufficiency (VBI),"Dizziness, blurred vision, unsteady gait","Vertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI) describes a temporary set of symptoms due to decreased blood flow (ischemia) in the posterior circulation of the brain.  The posterior circulation supplies the medulla, pons, midbrain, cerebellum and (in 70-80% of people) supplies the posterior cerebellar artery to the thalamus and occipital cortex.  As a result, symptoms vary widely depending which brain region is predominantly affected. 
The term 'vertebrobasilar insufficiency' may be used to describe disease in the vertebral and basilar arteries which predisposes to acute embolic events such as transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and stroke.  Alternatively it may be used to describe recurrent symptoms which result from narrowing (stenosis) of these arteries in combination with changes of blood pressure or head position."
Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,"Triad sign, abdominal pain, back pain, abdominal mass, obstructive jaundice, hypotension, nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension, shock, dizziness, loss of consciousness, cold extremities","Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a localized enlargement of the abdominal aorta such that the diameter is greater than 3 cm or more than 50% larger than normal. An AAA usually causes no symptoms, except during rupture. Occasionally, abdominal, back, or leg pain may occur. Large aneurysms can sometimes be felt by pushing on the abdomen. Rupture may result in pain in the abdomen or back, low blood pressure, or loss of consciousness, and often results in death."
Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding Infertility,"Amenorrhea, abdominal pain, changes in menstrual cycle, scanty menstruation, heavy menstruation, dark menstruation, dysmenorrhea","Abnormal uterine bleeding is vaginal bleeding from the uterus that is abnormally frequent, lasts excessively long, is heavier than normal, or is irregular. The term ""dysfunctional uterine bleeding"" was used when no underlying cause was present. Quality of life may be negatively affected.
The underlying causes may be structural or non-structural and are classified in accordance with the FIGO system 1 & 2. Common causes include: Ovulation problems, fibroids, the lining of the uterus growing into the uterine wall, uterine polyps, underlying bleeding problems, side effects from birth control, or cancer."
Fibrosarcoma,"Enlarged mass, often accompanied by pain and local skin numbness, congested surface of the mass","Fibrosarcoma (fibroblastic sarcoma) is a malignant mesenchymal tumour derived from fibrous connective tissue and characterized by the presence of immature proliferating fibroblasts or undifferentiated anaplastic spindle cells in a storiform pattern. Fibrosarcomas mainly arise in people between the ages of 25 and 79. It originates in fibrous tissues of the bone and invades long or flat bones such as the femur, tibia, and mandible. It also involves the periosteum and overlying muscle.


== Presentation ==


=== Adult-type ===
Individuals presenting with fibrosarcoma are usually adults thirty to fifty-five years old, often presenting with pain."
Angiosarcoma,"Angiogenesis, systemic vascular damage, arteriosclerosis","Angiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive cancer that starts in the endothelial cells that line the walls of blood vessels or lymphatic vessels. Since they are made from vascular lining, they can appear anywhere and at any age, but older people are more commonly affected, and the skin is the most affected area, with approximately 60% of cases being cutaneous (skin). Specifically, the scalp makes up ~50% of angiosarcoma cases, but this is still <0.1% of all head and neck tumors. Since angiosarcoma is an umbrella term for many types of tumor that vary greatly in origin and location, many symptoms may occur, from completely asymptomatic to non-specific symptoms like skin lesions, ulceration, shortness of breath and abdominal pain. Multiple-organ involvement at time of diagnosis is common and makes it difficult to ascertain origin and how to treat it."
Cervical Dislocation,"Paralysis, sensory disturbances, neck and shoulder pain","Cervical dislocation is a common method of animal euthanasia. It refers to a technique used in physical euthanasia of small animals by applying pressure to the neck and dislocating the spinal column from the skull or brain. The aim is to quickly separate the spinal cord from the brain so as to provide the animal with a fast, painless, and easy death. 


== Technique ==
Firm pressure is applied at the base of the skull, along with a sharp pinching and twisting of the thumb and forefinger. At the same time, the tail is pulled backward."
Normal-Tension Glaucoma (NTG),"Eye pain, blurred vision, decreased visual acuity","Normal tension glaucoma (NTG) is an eye disease, a neuropathy of the optic nerve, that shows all the characteristics of primary open angle glaucoma except one: the elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) - the classic hallmark of glaucoma - is missing. Normal tension glaucoma is in many cases closely associated with general issues of blood circulation and of organ perfusion like arterial hypotension, metabolic syndrome, and Flammer syndrome.


== Clinical relevance ==
Over many years, glaucoma has been defined by an intraocular pressure of more than 20 mm Hg. Incompatible with this (now obsolete) definition of glaucoma was the ever larger number of cases that have been reported in medical literature in the 1980s and 1990s who had the typical signs of glaucomatous damage, like optic nerve head excavation and thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer, while these patients had an IOP that would generally have been regarded as ""normal"". It is now widely estimated that a larger percentage of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) are suffering from  normal tension glaucoma."
Pregnancy Complicated by Rheumatic Heart Disease,"Fatigue, palpitations, dyspnea after activity, cyanosis, coughing up blood","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is any disease involving the heart or blood vessels. CVDs constitute a class of diseases that includes: coronary artery diseases (e.g. angina, heart attack), heart failure, hypertensive heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease, carditis, aortic aneurysms, peripheral artery disease, thromboembolic disease, and venous thrombosis.
The underlying mechanisms vary depending on the disease. It is estimated that dietary risk factors are associated with 53% of CVD deaths."
Pulmonary Consumption,"Coughing, expulsion of thick sputum and foam, accompanied by alternating chills and fever, emaciation, lethargy, palpitations, shortness of breath, dry lips, and a weak and rapid pulse","Tuberculosis (TB), also known colloquially as the ""white death"", or historically as consumption, is a contagious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteria. Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections show no symptoms, in which case it is known as inactive or latent tuberculosis. A small proportion of latent infections progress to active disease that, if left untreated, can be fatal. Typical symptoms of active TB are chronic cough with blood-containing mucus, fever, night sweats, and weight loss."
Hepatitis D,"Fatigue, loss of appetite, discomfort in the liver area, jaundice","Hepatitis E is inflammation of the liver caused by infection with the hepatitis E virus (HEV); it is a type of viral hepatitis. Hepatitis E has mainly a fecal-oral transmission route that is similar to hepatitis A, although the viruses are unrelated. HEV is a positive-sense, single-stranded, nonenveloped, RNA icosahedral virus and one of five known human hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E.
Like hepatitis A, hepatitis E usually follows an acute and self-limiting course of illness (the condition is temporary and the individual recovers) with low death rates in resource-rich areas; however, it can be more severe in pregnant women and people with a weakened immune system, with substantially higher death rates. In pregnant women, especially in the third trimester, the disease is more often severe and is associated with a clinical syndrome called fulminant liver failure, with death rates around 20%. Whereas pregnant women may have a rapid and severe course, organ transplant recipients who receive medications to weaken the immune system and prevent organ rejection can develop a slower and more persistent form called chronic hepatitis E, which is so diagnosed after 3 months of continuous viremia."
Osteogenesis Imperfecta,"Spontaneous fractures, blue sclerae, joint hypermobility, dwarfism, poor dental development","Osteogenesis imperfecta (IPA: ; OI), colloquially known as brittle bone disease, is a group of genetic disorders that all result in bones that break easily.:85 The range of symptomson the skeleton as well as on the body's other organsmay be mild to severe.:1512 Symptoms found in various types of OI include whites of the eye (sclerae) that are blue instead, short stature, loose joints, hearing loss, breathing problems and problems with the teeth (dentinogenesis imperfecta). Potentially life-threatening complications, all of which become more common in more severe OI, include: tearing (dissection) of the major arteries, such as the aorta;:333 pulmonary valve insufficiency secondary to distortion of the ribcage;:335341 and basilar invagination.:106107
The underlying mechanism is usually a problem with connective tissue due to a lack of, or poorly formed, type I collagen.:1513 In more than 90% of cases, OI occurs due to mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes. These mutations may be hereditary in an autosomal dominant manner but may also occur spontaneously (de novo). There are four clinically defined types: type I, the least severe; type IV, moderately severe; type III, severe and progressively deforming; and type II, perinatally lethal. As of September 2021, 19 different genes are known to cause the 21 documented genetically defined types of OI, many of which are extremely rare and have only been documented in a few individuals."
Pregnancy Complicated by Acute Pyelonephritis,"Miscarriage, premature birth, fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, back pain, renal tenderness on percussion","Pyelonephritis  is inflammation of the kidney, typically due to a bacterial infection. Symptoms most often include fever and flank tenderness. Other symptoms may include nausea, burning with urination, and frequent urination. Complications may include pus around the kidney, sepsis, or kidney failure.
It is typically due to a bacterial infection, most commonly Escherichia coli."
Primary Thyroid Lymphoma,"Difficulty breathing, hoarseness, hard thyroid mass","Thyroid lymphoma is a rare cancer constituting 1% to 2% of all thyroid cancers and less than 2% of lymphomas. Thyroid lymphomas are classified as nonHodgkin's B-cell lymphomas in a majority of cases, although Hodgkin's lymphoma of the thyroid has also been identified.


== Signs and symptoms ==
As with other thyroid lesions, thyroid lymphoma affects predominantly females over 70 years of age with a history of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Thus, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is considered a risk factor for thyroid lymphoma development. Thyroid lymphoma manifests as a rapidly enlarging neck mass which may compress the nearby trachea thereby causing narrowing or obstruction of the airway resulting in breathing difficulties or even respiratory failure."
Acute Suppurative Cholangitis,"Abdominal pain, fever, jaundice, sudden right upper quadrant colic, consciousness disorders, nausea and vomiting","Ascending cholangitis, also known as acute cholangitis or simply cholangitis, is inflammation of the bile duct, usually caused by bacteria ascending from its junction with the duodenum (first part of the small intestine). It tends to occur if the bile duct is already partially obstructed by gallstones.
Cholangitis can be life-threatening, and is regarded as a medical emergency. Characteristic symptoms include yellow discoloration of the skin or whites of the eyes, fever, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, low blood pressure and confusion. Initial treatment is with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but there is often an underlying problem (such as gallstones or narrowing in the bile duct) for which further tests and treatments may be necessary, usually in the form of endoscopy to relieve obstruction of the bile duct."
Platelet Dysfunction,"Skin purpura, ecchymosis, nosebleeds, visceral bleeding, and excessive menstrual bleeding in females","Plateletpheresis (more accurately called thrombocytapheresis or thrombapheresis, though these names are rarely used) is the process of collecting thrombocytes, more commonly called platelets, a component of blood involved in blood clotting.  The term specifically refers to the method of collecting the platelets, which is performed by a device used in blood donation that separates the platelets and returns other portions of the blood to the donor.  Platelet transfusion can be a life-saving procedure in preventing or treating serious complications from bleeding and hemorrhage in patients who have disorders manifesting as thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) or platelet dysfunction.  This process may also be used therapeutically to treat disorders resulting in extraordinarily high platelet counts such as essential thrombocytosis.


== Platelet transfusion ==
Platelet transfusions are traditionally given to patients undergoing chemotherapy for leukemia, multiple myeloma, those with aplastic anemia, AIDS, hypersplenism, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), sepsis, bone marrow transplant, radiation treatment, organ transplant or surgeries such as cardiopulmonary bypass."
Hematuria,"Red urine, microscopic hematuria","Hematuria or haematuria is defined as the presence of blood or red blood cells in the urine. ""Gross hematuria"" occurs when urine appears red, brown, or tea-colored due to the presence of blood. Hematuria may also be subtle and only detectable with a microscope or laboratory test. Blood that enters and mixes with the urine can come from any location within the urinary system, including the kidney, ureter, urinary bladder, urethra, and in men, the prostate. Common causes of hematuria include urinary tract infection (UTI), kidney stones, viral illness, trauma, bladder cancer, and exercise."
Skull Base Tumor,"Reduced sense of smell, dizziness, headache, diplopia, oculomotor disturbances, vomiting, epileptic seizures, facial numbness, hemiparesis or hemiplegia","In medicine, proton therapy, or proton radiotherapy, is a type of particle therapy that uses a beam of protons to irradiate diseased tissue, most often to treat cancer. The chief advantage of proton therapy over other types of external beam radiotherapy is that the dose of protons is deposited over a narrow range of depth; hence in minimal entry, exit, or scattered radiation dose to healthy nearby tissues.
When evaluating whether to treat a tumor with photon or proton therapy, physicians may choose proton therapy if it is important to deliver a higher radiation dose to targeted tissues while significantly decreasing radiation to nearby organs at risk. The American Society for Radiation Oncology Model Policy for Proton Beam therapy says proton therapy is considered reasonable if sparing the surrounding normal tissue ""cannot be adequately achieved with photon-based radiotherapy"" and can benefit the patient. Like photon radiation therapy, proton therapy is often used in conjunction with surgery and/or chemotherapy to most effectively treat cancer."
Pediatric Urolithiasis,"Vomiting, pallor, cold sweats, difficulty urinating, pain during urination","Pediatric urology is a surgical subspecialty of medicine dealing with the disorders of children's genitourinary systems. Pediatric urologists provide care for both boys and girls ranging from birth to early adult age. The most common problems are those involving disorders of urination, reproductive organs and testes.


== Focus areas ==
Some of the problems they deal with are: 

Bladder control problems such as bedwetting and daytime urinary incontinence
Undescended testes (cryptorchidism)
Hypospadias
Epispadias
Urolithiasis (bladder and kidney stones)
Chordee and other minor malformations of the penis
Phimosis
Urinary obstruction and vesicoureteral reflux
Neurogenic bladder (e.g., associated with spina bifida)
Antenatal hydronephrosis
Tumors and cancers of the kidneys
Repair of genitourinary trauma
Genitourinary malformations and birth defects
Prune belly syndrome
Cloacal exstrophy, bladder exstrophy, and epispadias
Ambiguous genitalia and intersex conditions


== Pediatric urologists ==
In North America, most pediatric urologists are associated with children's hospitals. Training for board certification in pediatric urology typically consists of a surgery internship as part of a urology residency followed by subspecialty training in pediatric urology at a major children's hospital."
Respiratory Acidosis in the Elderly,"Shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, headache, coma, arrhythmia, restlessness, tremors, confusion, delirium, blurred vision","Hypovolemic shock is a form of shock caused by severe hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume or extracellular fluid in the body). It can be caused by severe dehydration or blood loss. Hypovolemic shock is a medical emergency; if left untreated, the insufficient blood flow can cause damage to organs, leading to multiple organ failure.
In treating hypovolemic shock, it is important to determine the cause of the underlying hypovolemia, which may be the result of bleeding or other fluid losses. To minimize ischemic damage to tissues, treatment involves quickly replacing lost blood or fluids, with consideration of both rate and the type of fluids used."
Pulmonary Metastatic Tumor,"Cough, expectoration, foul-smelling sputum, fever, hemoptysis, dyspnea, chest pain","Metastasis is a pathogenic agent's spreading from an initial or primary site to a different or secondary site within the host's body; the term is typically used when referring to metastasis by a cancerous tumor.  The newly pathological sites, then, are metastases (mets). It is generally distinguished from cancer invasion, which is the direct extension and penetration by cancer cells into neighboring tissues.
Cancer occurs after cells are genetically altered to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. This uncontrolled proliferation by mitosis produces a primary heterogeneic tumour."
Reye's Syndrome,"Hypoglycemia, headache, coma, dehydration, syncope, nausea and vomiting, hepatomegaly, abnormal respiration, cerebral edema, irritability, somnolence, seizures","Reye syndrome is a rapidly worsening brain disease. Symptoms of Reye syndrome may include vomiting, personality changes, confusion, seizures, and loss of consciousness. While liver toxicity typically occurs in the syndrome, jaundice usually does not. Death occurs in 2040% of those affected with Reye syndrome, and about a third of those who survive are left with a significant degree of brain damage.
The cause of Reye syndrome is unknown."
Colorectal Hemangioma,"Hematochezia, anemia, melena, recurrent bleeding, tenesmus, a sensation of incomplete bowel evacuation","A neoplasm () is a type of abnormal and excessive growth of tissue. The process that occurs to form or produce a neoplasm is called neoplasia. The growth of a neoplasm is uncoordinated with that of the normal surrounding tissue, and persists in growing abnormally, even if the original trigger is removed. This abnormal growth usually forms a mass, which may be called a tumour or tumor.
ICD-10 classifies neoplasms into four main groups: benign neoplasms, in situ neoplasms, malignant neoplasms, and neoplasms of uncertain or unknown behavior."
Pediatric Vascular Hemophilia,"Nosebleeds, bleeding gums, increased menstrual flow, anemia","In biology, hemostasis or haemostasis is a process to prevent and stop bleeding, meaning to keep blood within a damaged blood vessel (the opposite of hemostasis is hemorrhage). It is the first stage of wound healing.  Hemostasis involves three major steps:

vasoconstriction
temporary blockage of a hole in a damaged blood vessel by a platelet plug
blood coagulation (formation of fibrin clots)
Coagulation, the changing of blood from a liquid to a gel which forms the fibrin clots, is essential to hemostasis. Intact blood vessels moderate blood's tendency to form clots. The endothelial cells of intact vessels prevent blood clotting with a heparin-like molecule and thrombomodulin, and prevent platelet aggregation with nitric oxide and prostacyclin."
Malignant Eccrine Spiradenoma,"Sepsis, constipation, convulsions, proteinuria, hypotension, nausea and abdominal pain, diarrhea, hyperesthesia","Spiradenomas (SA) are rare, benign cutaneous adnexal tumors that may progress to become their malignant counterparts, i.e. spiradenocarcinomas (SAC). Cutaneous adnexal tumors are a group of skin tumors consisting of tissues that have differentiated (i.e. matured from stem cells) towards one of the four primary adnexal structures found in normal skin: hair follicles, sebaceous sweat glands, apocrine sweat glands, and eccrine sweat glands. SA and SAC tumors were regarded as eccrine gland tumors and termed eccrine spiradenomas and eccrine spiradenocarcinomas, respectively."
Lower Limb Lymphedema,"Swelling of one side of the body, thickened skin, dryness, roughness, pigmentation","Lymphedema, also known as lymphoedema and lymphatic edema, is a condition of localized swelling caused by a compromised lymphatic system. The lymphatic system functions as a critical portion of the body's immune system and returns interstitial fluid to the bloodstream.
Lymphedema is most frequently a complication of cancer treatment or parasitic infections, but it can also be seen in a number of genetic disorders. Tissues with lymphedema are at high risk of infection because the lymphatic system has been compromised.
Though incurable and progressive, a number of treatments may improve symptoms."
Pericardial Thymoma,"Pericardial effusion, Cardiac tamponade, Distended jugular veins, Edema of lower extremities, Tachycardia, Reduced cardiac output, Myasthenia gravis, Distant heart sounds, Shock, Hepatomegaly, Abnormal heart sounds","A thymoma is a tumor originating from the epithelial cells of the thymus that is considered a rare neoplasm. Thymomas are frequently associated with neuromuscular disorders such as  myasthenia gravis; thymoma is found in 20% of patients with myasthenia gravis. Once diagnosed, thymomas may be removed surgically. In the rare case of a malignant tumor, chemotherapy may be used.


== Signs and symptoms ==
A third of all people with a thymoma have symptoms caused by compression of the surrounding organs by an expansive mass."
Normal-Tension Glaucoma (NTG),"Eye pain, blurred vision, decreased visual acuity","Normal tension glaucoma (NTG) is an eye disease, a neuropathy of the optic nerve, that shows all the characteristics of primary open angle glaucoma except one: the elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) - the classic hallmark of glaucoma - is missing. Normal tension glaucoma is in many cases closely associated with general issues of blood circulation and of organ perfusion like arterial hypotension, metabolic syndrome, and Flammer syndrome.


== Clinical relevance ==
Over many years, glaucoma has been defined by an intraocular pressure of more than 20 mm Hg.

It is now widely estimated that a larger percentage of patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) are suffering from  normal tension glaucoma."
Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus,"Vulvar itching, vulvar skin is white or presents with fissures and ulceration; severe cases may lead to labial adhesion and disappearance, affecting sexual life.","Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease, of unknown cause, which can affect any body part of any person, but has a strong preference for the genitals (penis, vulva), and is also known as balanitis xerotica obliterans when it affects the penis. Lichen sclerosus is not contagious. There is a well-documented increase of skin cancer risk in LS, potentially improvable with treatment. LS in adult age women is normally incurable, although treatment can lessen its effects, and it often gets progressively worse if not treated properly. Most males with mild or intermediate disease, restricted to foreskin or glans, can be cured by either medical or surgical treatment."
Neonatal Gastric Perforation,"Cyanosis, vomiting, peritonitis, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, feeding refusal, cyanotic lips, skin mottling","Neonatal sepsis is a type of neonatal infection and specifically refers to the presence in a newborn baby of a bacterial blood stream infection (BSI) (such as meningitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, or gastroenteritis) in the setting of fever. Older textbooks may refer to neonatal sepsis as ""sepsis neonatorum"". Criteria with regards to hemodynamic compromise or respiratory failure are not useful clinically because these symptoms often do not arise in neonates until death is imminent and unpreventable. Neonatal sepsis is divided into two categories: early-onset sepsis (EOS) and late-onset sepsis (LOS). EOS refers to sepsis presenting in the first 7 days of life (although some refer to EOS as within the first 72 hours of life), with LOS referring to presentation of sepsis after 7 days (or 72 hours, depending on the system used)."
Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma,"Jaundice, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting","Cholangiocarcinoma, also known as bile duct cancer, is a type of cancer that forms in the bile ducts. Symptoms of cholangiocarcinoma may include abdominal pain, yellowish skin, weight loss, generalized itching, and fever. Light colored stool or dark urine may also occur. Other biliary tract cancers include gallbladder cancer and cancer of the ampulla of Vater.
Risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma include primary sclerosing cholangitis (an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts), ulcerative colitis, cirrhosis, hepatitis C, hepatitis B, infection with certain liver flukes, and some congenital liver malformations."
Neurocutaneous Syndrome,"Skin itching, numbness, and reduced sensation in localized tissues","Phakomatoses, also known as neurocutaneous syndromes, are a group of multisystemic diseases that most prominently affect structures primarily derived from the ectoderm such as the central nervous system, skin and eyes. The majority of phakomatoses are single-gene disorders that may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked pattern. Presentations may vary dramatically between patients with the same particular syndrome due to mosaicism, variable expressivity, and penetrance.
Many phakomatoses are caused by mutations which alter functioning of the RASmitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway that regulates cellular growth, differentiation, proliferation and death. This results in a tendency for individuals with these mutations to develop various types of benign or malignant tumors depending on the particular mutation."
Vulvar Cancer,"Vulvar pain, vulvar ulcers, vulvar itching, vulvar swelling, burning sensation during urination, itching or pain, purulent vaginal discharge, bloody vaginal secretions, frequent urination with urgency and pain during urination","Vulvar cancer is a cancer of the vulva, the outer portion of the female genitals. It most commonly affects the labia majora. Less often, the labia minora, clitoris, or Bartholin's glands are affected. Symptoms include a lump, itchiness, changes in the skin, or bleeding from the vulva.
Risk factors include vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), HPV infection, genital warts, smoking, and many sexual partners."
Pediatric Sepsis,"Chills, high fever, lethargy or restlessness, pale complexion, cold extremities, rapid breathing, jaundice","Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
This initial stage of sepsis is followed by suppression of the immune system. Common signs and symptoms include fever, increased heart rate, increased breathing rate, and confusion. There may also be symptoms related to a specific infection, such as a cough with pneumonia, or painful urination with a kidney infection. The very young, old, and people with a weakened immune system may not have any symptoms that are specific to their infection, and their body temperature may be low or normal instead of constituting a fever."
Cryptococcosis,"Low fever, nausea, restlessness, lung infection, cellulitis, high fever, difficulty breathing, carbuncle","Cryptococcosis is a potentially fatal fungal infection of mainly the lungs, presenting as a pneumonia, and in the brain, where it appears as a meningitis. Coughing, difficulty breathing, chest pain and fever are seen when the lungs are infected. When the brain is infected, symptoms include headache, fever, neck pain, nausea and vomiting, light sensitivity and confusion or changes in behavior. It can also affect other parts of the body including skin, where it may appear as several fluid-filled nodules with dead tissue.
It is caused by the fungi Cryptococcus neoformans or less commonly Cryptococcus gattii, and is acquired by breathing in the spores from the air."
Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN),"Increased vaginal discharge, bloody vaginal discharge, contact bleeding","Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), also known as cervical dysplasia, is the abnormal growth of cells on the surface of the cervix that could potentially lead to cervical cancer. More specifically, CIN refers to the potentially precancerous transformation of cells of the cervix.
CIN most commonly occurs at the squamocolumnar junction of the cervix, a transitional area between the squamous epithelium of the vagina and the columnar epithelium of the endocervix. It can also occur in vaginal walls and vulvar epithelium. CIN is graded on a 13 scale, with 3 being the most abnormal (see classification section below)."
Hepatitis,"Loss of appetite, nausea and aversion to oil, fatigue, fever, discomfort and swelling in the liver area, spider angiomas, and palmar erythema","Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue. Some people or animals with hepatitis have no symptoms, whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hepatitis is acute if it resolves within six months, and chronic if it lasts longer than six months. Acute hepatitis can resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or (rarely) result in acute liver failure. Chronic hepatitis may progress to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer."
Vaginal Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"Hematuria, frequent urination or difficulty urinating, bleeding during intercourse","Squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC),  also known as epidermoid carcinoma, comprises a number of different types of cancer that begin in squamous cells. These cells form on the surface of the skin, on the lining of hollow organs in the body, and on the lining of the respiratory and digestive tracts.
The squamous-cell carcinomas of different body sites can show differences in their presented symptoms, natural history, prognosis, and response to treatment.


== By body location ==
Human papillomavirus infection has been associated with SCCs of the oropharynx, lung, fingers, and anogenital region.


=== Head and neck cancer ===

About 90% of cases of head and neck cancer (cancer of the mouth, nasal cavity, nasopharynx, throat and associated structures) are due to SCC.


=== Skin ===
Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma is the second most common skin cancer, accounting for over 1 million cases in the United States each year."
Fibrous Histiocytoma,"Intellectual disability, gonadal dysfunction, congenital anomalies of the eyes, vascular malformations","A dermatofibroma, or benign fibrous histiocytomas, is a benign nodule in the skin, typically on the legs, elbows or chest of an adult. It is usually painless.
It usually ranges from 0.2 to 2 cm in size but larger examples have been reported. It typically results from mild trauma such as an insect bite. Risk factors for developing multiple dermatofibromas include lupus, HIV, blood cancer and some medicines that weaken immunity."
Hemophagocytic Syndrome,"Anemia, jaundice, malnutrition","In hematology, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), also known as haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (British spelling), and hemophagocytic or haemophagocytic syndrome, is an uncommon hematologic disorder seen more often in children than in adults. It is a life-threatening disease of severe hyperinflammation caused by uncontrolled proliferation of benign lymphocytes and macrophages that secrete high amounts of inflammatory cytokines. It is classified as one of the cytokine storm syndromes. There are inherited and non-inherited (acquired) causes of HLH.


== Signs and symptoms ==
HLH as defined by the HLH-04 criteria is a descriptive diagnosis. Its components are non-specific."
Ocular Neurofibromatosis,"Ptosis, café-au-lait spots, proptosis, visual impairment, freckling, pigmentary abnormalities, optic disc edema","Phakomatoses, also known as neurocutaneous syndromes, are a group of multisystemic diseases that most prominently affect structures primarily derived from the ectoderm such as the central nervous system, skin and eyes. The majority of phakomatoses are single-gene disorders that may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked pattern. Presentations may vary dramatically between patients with the same particular syndrome due to mosaicism, variable expressivity, and penetrance.
Many phakomatoses are caused by mutations which alter functioning of the RASmitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway that regulates cellular growth, differentiation, proliferation and death. This results in a tendency for individuals with these mutations to develop various types of benign or malignant tumors depending on the particular mutation."
Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma,"Swelling and pain in the distal femur and proximal tibia, walking impairment, weight loss, poor spirit","A histiocytoma is a tumour consisting of histiocytes. Histiocytes are cells that are a part of the mononuclear phagocytic system, a part of the body's immune system that consists of phagocytic cells, which are responsible for engulfing solid particles by the cell membrane to form an internal phagosome by phagocytes and protists. Myxofibrosarcoma had been classified as a type of histiocytoma. However, the World Health Organization (2020) reclassified myxofibrosarcoma as a malignant tumor in the category of fibroblastic/myofibroblastic tumors.
Types include:

benign fibrous histiocytoma: This tumor has also been termed benign fibrous histiocytomas of the skin, superficial/cutaneous benign fibrous histiocytomas, common fibrous histiocytoma, and more recently dermatofibroma."
Acute Carbon Monoxide Poisoning,"Headache, weakness, dizziness, cherry red coloration of the lips","Carbon monoxide poisoning typically occurs from breathing in carbon monoxide (CO) at excessive levels. Symptoms are often described as ""flu-like"" and commonly include headache, dizziness, weakness, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. Large exposures can result in loss of consciousness, arrhythmias, seizures, or death. The classically described ""cherry red skin"" rarely occurs. Long-term complications may include chronic fatigue, trouble with memory, and movement problems."
Foot-and-mouth disease,Vesicles occur on the mucous membranes of the mouth and the skin of the mammary glands,"Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) or hoof-and-mouth disease (HMD) is an infectious and sometimes fatal viral disease that primarily affects even-toed ungulates, including domestic and wild bovids. The virus causes a high fever lasting two to six days, followed by blisters inside the mouth and near the hoof that may rupture and cause lameness.
FMD has very severe implications for animal farming, since it is highly infectious and can be spread by infected animals comparatively easily through contact with contaminated farming equipment, vehicles, clothing, and feed, and by domestic and wild predators. Its containment demands considerable efforts in vaccination, strict monitoring, trade restrictions, quarantines, and the culling of both infected and healthy (uninfected) animals.

Susceptible animals include cattle, water buffalo, sheep, goats, pigs, antelope, deer, and bison."
Intramedullary Tumor,"radicular pain, sensory disturbances, motor dysfunction, constipation, urgency or even incontinence of urine and feces","Spinal tumors are neoplasms located in either the vertebral column or the spinal cord. There are three main types of spinal tumors classified based on their location: extradural and intradural (intradural-intramedullary and intradural-extramedullary). Extradural tumors are located outside the dura mater lining and are most commonly metastatic. Intradural tumors are located inside the dura mater lining and are further subdivided into intramedullary and extramedullary tumors. Intradural-intramedullary tumors are located within the dura and spinal cord parenchyma, while intradural-extramedullary tumors are located within the dura but outside the spinal cord parenchyma."
Pneumocystis Pneumonia,"Shortness of breath, coughing, cyanosis, three-concave sign, difficulty breathing, restlessness, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, fever, dry cough","Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), also known as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), is a form of pneumonia that is caused by the yeast-like fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii.
Pneumocystis specimens are commonly found in the lungs of healthy people although it is usually not a cause for disease. However, they are a source of opportunistic infection and can cause lung infections in people with a weak immune system or other predisposing health conditions. PCP is seen in people with HIV/AIDS (who account for 30-40% of PCP cases), those using medications that suppress the immune system, and people with cancer, autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, and chronic lung disease.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms may develop over several days or weeks and may include: shortness of breath and/or difficulty breathing (of gradual onset), fever, dry/non-productive cough, weight loss, night sweats, chills, and fatigue."
Acute Stress Reaction,"Stupor, consciousness disorder, clouding of consciousness, disorientation, speaking in monosyllables or disconnected phrases, tense expression, disorganized movements, restlessness, impulsive destructive behavior, sitting or lying down immobile","Acute stress reaction (ASR), also known as psychological shock, mental shock, or simply shock, as well as acute stress disorder (ASD), is a psychological response to a terrifying, traumatic, or surprising experience. The reactions may include but are not limited to intrusive thoughts, or dissociation, and reactivity symptoms such as avoidance or hyperarousal. It may be exhibited for days or weeks after the traumatic event. If the condition is not correctly addressed, it may develop into post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).


== Diagnosis ==
The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) treats this condition differently from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)."
Gonococcal Conjunctivitis,"Eye pain, photophobia, tearing, eyelid redness and swelling, conjunctival congestion, edema, and copious purulent discharge","Neisseria gonorrhoeae, also known as gonococcus (singular) or gonococci (plural), is a species of Gram-negative diplococci bacteria first isolated by Albert Neisser in 1879. An  obligate human pathogen, it primarily colonizes the mucosal lining of the urogenital tract; however, it is also capable of adhering to the mucosa of the nose, pharynx, rectum, and conjunctiva. It causes the sexually transmitted genitourinary infection gonorrhea as well as other forms of gonococcal disease including disseminated gonococcemia, septic arthritis, and gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum.
N. gonorrhoeae is oxidase positive and a microaerophile that is capable of surviving phagocytosis and growing inside neutrophils. Culturing it requires carbon dioxide supplementation and enriched agar (chocolate agar) with various antibiotics (ThayerMartin)."
Aortic Valve Calcification,"Chest tightness, palpitations, shortness of breath","Aortic stenosis (AS or AoS) is the narrowing  of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aorta begins), such that problems result. It may occur at the aortic valve as well as above and below this level. It typically gets worse over time. Symptoms often come on gradually with a decreased ability to exercise often occurring first. If heart failure, loss of consciousness, or heart related chest pain occur due to AS the outcomes are worse."
Cerebral Malaria,"Headache, muscle pain, fatigue, restlessness","Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects vertebrates and Anopheles mosquitoes. Human malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, fatigue, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases, it can cause jaundice, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin 10 to 15 days after being bitten by an infected Anopheles mosquito. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later."
Hepatitis D,"Fatigue, loss of appetite, discomfort in the liver area, jaundice","Hepatitis E is inflammation of the liver caused by infection with the hepatitis E virus (HEV); it is a type of viral hepatitis. Hepatitis E has mainly a fecal-oral transmission route that is similar to hepatitis A, although the viruses are unrelated. HEV is a positive-sense, single-stranded, nonenveloped, RNA icosahedral virus and one of five known human hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E.
Like hepatitis A, hepatitis E usually follows an acute and self-limiting course of illness (the condition is temporary and the individual recovers) with low death rates in resource-rich areas; however, it can be more severe in pregnant women and people with a weakened immune system, with substantially higher death rates. In pregnant women, especially in the third trimester, the disease is more often severe and is associated with a clinical syndrome called fulminant liver failure, with death rates around 20%. Whereas pregnant women may have a rapid and severe course, organ transplant recipients who receive medications to weaken the immune system and prevent organ rejection can develop a slower and more persistent form called chronic hepatitis E, which is so diagnosed after 3 months of continuous viremia."
Granulocytic Monocytic Leukemia,"Skin lesions as purple to reddish-brown papules, nodules, patches, gingival ulcers, necrosis, bleeding, anemia","Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), also known as chronic myeloid leukemia, is a cancer of the white blood cells. It is a form of leukemia characterized by the increased and unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of these cells in the blood. CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) and their precursors is found; characteristic increase in basophils is clinically relevant. It is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome.
CML is largely treated with targeted drugs called tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which have led to dramatically improved long-term survival rates since 2001."
Gangliosidosis,"Corneal opacification, joint contractures, convulsions, decreased muscle tone, abnormal body physique, vision impairment, difficulty swallowing","TaySachs disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disease that results in the destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The most common form is infantile TaySachs disease, which becomes apparent around the age of three to six months of age, with the infant losing the ability to turn over, sit, or crawl. This is then followed by seizures, hearing loss, and inability to move, with death usually occurring by the age of three to five. Less commonly, the disease may occur later in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood (juvenile or late-onset). These forms tend to be less severe, but the juvenile form typically results in death by the age of 15."
Coronary Atherosclerotic Heart Disease,"Precordial discomfort, angina pectoris, shock, syncope, sudden death, irregular heartbeat, cyanosis of the lips, transient cerebral ischemia, shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, sweating, cold and clammy skin, appearance of serious illness","Atherosclerosis is a pattern of the disease arteriosclerosis, characterized by development of abnormalities called lesions in walls of arteries. This is a chronic inflammatory disease involving many different cell types and is driven by elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood. These lesions may lead to narrowing of the arterial walls due to buildup of atheromatous plaques. At the onset there are usually no symptoms, but if they develop, symptoms generally begin around middle age. In severe cases, it can result in coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or kidney disorders, depending on which body part(s) the affected arteries are located in the body."
Cryptococcosis,"Low fever, nausea, restlessness, lung infection, cellulitis, high fever, difficulty breathing, carbuncle","Cryptococcosis is a potentially fatal fungal infection of mainly the lungs, presenting as a pneumonia, and in the brain, where it appears as a meningitis. Coughing, difficulty breathing, chest pain and fever are seen when the lungs are infected. When the brain is infected, symptoms include headache, fever, neck pain, nausea and vomiting, light sensitivity and confusion or changes in behavior. It can also affect other parts of the body including skin, where it may appear as several fluid-filled nodules with dead tissue.
It is caused by the fungi Cryptococcus neoformans or less commonly Cryptococcus gattii, and is acquired by breathing in the spores from the air."
Malignant Granuloma of the Nose,"Intermittent nasal obstruction, accompanied by serous or bloody discharge, nasal dryness and crusting, granulomatous ulcers may appear on the nasal septum.","Lethal midline granuloma (LMG) is an historical term for a condition in which necrotic and highly destructive lesions develop progressively in the middle of the face, principally the nose and palate. Many cases presented with ulcerations in or perforations of the palate.
LMG was thought to be a manifestation of three or four different diseases: the well-characterized disease of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, the ill-defined disorders of polymorphic reticulosis or mid-line malignant reticulosis, and an incompletely defined form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Subsequent studies found that the cells infiltrating the midline tissues in cases of lethal midline granuloma that were not clearly diagnosed as granulomatosis with polyangiitis were: a) infected by the EpsteinBarr virus and b) consisted of malignant lymphocytes, usually NK cells or, rarely, cytotoxic T cells. The disease is therefore now regarded as a NK/T cell malignancy, is grouped with other EpsteinBarr virusassociated lymphoproliferative diseases and is classified by the World Health Organization (2017 update) as a manifestation of the well-defined disease, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTCL-NT)."
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML),"Abnormal blood counts, fatigue, low-grade fever, night sweats, weight loss, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, leukocytosis, dizziness","Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), also known as chronic myeloid leukemia, is a cancer of the white blood cells. It is a form of leukemia characterized by the increased and unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of these cells in the blood. CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) and their precursors is found; characteristic increase in basophils is clinically relevant. It is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome.
CML is largely treated with targeted drugs called tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which have led to dramatically improved long-term survival rates since 2001."
Cryptosporidiosis,"Diarrhea, upper abdominal pain, upper abdominal discomfort, watery stools, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting","Cryptosporidiosis, sometimes informally called crypto, is a parasitic disease caused by Cryptosporidium, a genus of protozoan parasites in the phylum Apicomplexa. It affects the distal small intestine and can affect the respiratory tract in both immunocompetent (i.e., individuals with a normal functioning immune system) and immunocompromised (e.g., persons with HIV/AIDS or autoimmune disorders) individuals, resulting in watery diarrhea with or without an unexplained cough. In immunosuppressed individuals, the symptoms are particularly severe and can be fatal. It is primarily spread through the fecal-oral route, often through contaminated water; recent evidence suggests that it can also be transmitted via fomites contaminated with respiratory secretions. Cryptosporidium is commonly isolated in HIV-positive patients presenting with diarrhea."
Ventriculitis,"Pain, projectile vomiting, nuchal rigidity, altered consciousness, hypotension, high fever, seizures","Ventriculitis, also known as ependymitis, ventricular empyema, pyocephalus, and pyogenic ventriculitis, is the inflammation of the ventricles in the brain. The ventricles are responsible for containing and circulating cerebrospinal fluid throughout the brain. Ventriculitis is caused by infection of the ventricles, leading to swelling and inflammation. This is especially prevalent in patients with external ventricular drains and intraventricular stents. Ventriculitis can cause a wide variety of short-term symptoms and long-term side effects ranging from headaches and dizziness to unconsciousness and death if not treated early."
Ovarian Cancer,"Pelvic mass, abdominal discomfort, postmenopausal bleeding, cachexia","Ovarian cancer is a cancerous tumor of an ovary. It may originate from the ovary itself or more commonly from communicating nearby structures such as fallopian tubes or the inner lining of the abdomen. The ovary is made up of three different cell types including epithelial cells, germ cells, and stromal cells. When these cells become abnormal, they have the ability to divide and form tumors. These cells can also invade or spread to other parts of the body."
Acute Appendicitis,"Migratory or right lower abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, fever with chills, tenderness and rebound pain in the right lower abdomen, abdominal muscle rigidity, constipation, or diarrhea","Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. Symptoms commonly include right lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever and decreased appetite. However, approximately 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms. Severe complications of a ruptured appendix include widespread, painful inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall and sepsis.
Appendicitis is primarily caused by a blockage of the hollow portion in the appendix."
Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE),"Cognitive decline, visual disturbances, coma, myoclonus, opisthotonus, and floating eyeball phenomenon","Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), also known as Dawson disease, is a rare form of progressive brain inflammation caused by a persistent infection with the measles virus. The condition primarily affects children, teens, and young adults. It has been estimated that about 2 in 10,000 people who get measles will eventually develop SSPE. However, a 2016 study estimated that the rate for unvaccinated infants under 15 months was as high as 1 in 609. No cure for SSPE exists, and the condition is almost always fatal. SSPE should not be confused with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, which can also be caused by the measles virus, but has a very different timing and course."
Osteoradionecrosis of the Jaw,"Persistent pain, halitosis, general debility, cachexia, chronic anemia due to consumptive process, difficulty in eating","Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is a serious complication of radiation therapy in cancer treatment where radiated bone becomes necrotic and exposed. ORN occurs most commonly in the mouth during the treatment of head and neck cancer, and can arise over 5 years after radiation. Common signs and symptoms include pain, difficulty chewing, trismus, mouth-to-skin fistulas and non-healing ulcers.
The pathophysiology of ORN is fairly complex and involves drastic changes to bone tissue as a result of DNA damage and cell death caused by radiation treatment. Radiation therapy targeting tumor cells can affect normal cells as well, which can result in the death of bone tissue."
Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP),"Mucopurulent bloody stool, fatigue, weight loss, increased frequency of bowel movements","Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant inherited condition in which numerous adenomatous polyps form mainly in the epithelium of the large intestine. While these polyps start out benign, malignant transformation into colon cancer occurs when they are left untreated. Three variants are known to exist, FAP and attenuated FAP (originally called hereditary flat adenoma syndrome) are caused by APC gene defects on chromosome 5 while autosomal recessive FAP (or MUTYH-associated polyposis) is caused by defects in the MUTYH gene on chromosome 1. Of the three, FAP itself is the most severe and most common; although for all three, the resulting colonic polyps and cancers are initially confined to the colon wall. Detection and removal before metastasis outside the colon can greatly reduce and in many cases eliminate the spread of cancer."
Congenital Nonhemolytic Jaundice,"Jaundice, fatigue, indigestion, abdominal discomfort, mood swings, persistent fever","CriglerNajjar syndrome is a rare inherited autosomal recessive  disorder affecting the metabolism of bilirubin, a chemical formed from the breakdown of the heme in red blood cells. The disorder results in a form of nonhemolytic jaundice, which results in high levels of unconjugated bilirubin and often leads to brain damage in infants. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The annual incidence is estimated at 0.6-1 in 1,000,000.
This syndrome is divided into types I and II, with the latter sometimes called Arias syndrome."
Myocardial Infarction in the Elderly,"Irritability, sweating, fear, angina, nausea, vomiting","A myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops in one of the coronary arteries of the heart, causing infarction (tissue death) to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is retrosternal chest pain or discomfort that classically radiates to the left shoulder, arm, or jaw. The pain may occasionally feel like heartburn. This is the dangerous type of acute coronary syndrome.
Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, feeling tired, and decreased level of consciousness."
Basophilic Leukemia,"Fever, anemia, fatigue, general malaise, night sweats, headache, pruritus, cough, diarrhea","Acute basophilic leukemia (ABL) is a very rare & clinically aggressive subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) designated by the WHO as a distinct entity within the subcategory of AML, Not Otherwise Specified (NOS), which accounts for roughly 4-5% of all ""acute non-lymphocytic"" cases of leukemia. ABL can be either primary (sporadic) or secondary to an existing bone marrow neoplasm (commonly CML or AML with BCR-ABL1). In either case, the disease is characterized by rapid proliferation of abnormal basophils & immature blasts in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. This process interferes with normal blood cell production, giving rise to classic symptoms of AML & ultimately bone marrow failure. Given the role of basophils in coordinating histamine release during inflammatory reactions, those with ABL also typically experience symptoms of hyper-histaminemia which can manifest cutaneously & within the gastrointestinal tract."
Rectal Intussusception,Lower abdominal and anal prolapse,"A rectal prolapse occurs when walls of the rectum have prolapsed to such a degree that they protrude out of the anus and are visible outside the body. However, most researchers agree that there are 3 to 5 different types of rectal prolapse, depending on whether the prolapsed section is visible externally, and whether the full or only partial thickness of the rectal wall is involved.
Rectal prolapse may occur without any symptoms, but depending upon the nature of the prolapse there may be mucous discharge (mucus coming from the anus), rectal bleeding, degrees of fecal incontinence, and obstructed defecation symptoms.
Rectal prolapse is generally more common in elderly women, although it may occur at any age and in either sex. It is very rarely life-threatening, but the symptoms can be debilitating if left untreated."
Hypophosphatasia in Children,"Rickets, slow growth, weakness, chest deformity, anorexia, limb pain, limb shortening deformities, blue sclera, constipation","Hypophosphatasia (; also called deficiency of alkaline phosphatase, phosphoethanolaminuria, or Rathbun's syndrome; sometimes abbreviated HPP) is a rare, and sometimes fatal, inherited metabolic bone disease. Clinical symptoms are heterogeneous, ranging from the rapidly fatal, perinatal variant, with profound skeletal hypomineralization, respiratory compromise or vitamin B6 dependent seizures to a milder, progressive osteomalacia later in life. Tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) deficiency in osteoblasts and chondrocytes impairs bone mineralization, leading to rickets or osteomalacia. The pathognomonic finding is subnormal serum activity of the TNSALP enzyme, which is caused by one of 388 genetic mutations identified to date, in the gene encoding TNSALP. Genetic inheritance is autosomal recessive for the perinatal and infantile forms but either autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant in the milder forms.
The prevalence of hypophosphatasia is not known; one study estimated the live birth incidence of severe forms to be 1:100,000."
Pediatric Sacrococcygeal Teratoma,"Urinary disorders, bowel disorders, fecal incontinence in children, constipation, pain in the sacral or lower lumbar region","Sacrococcygeal teratoma (SCT) is a type of tumor known as a teratoma that develops at the base of the coccyx (tailbone) and is thought to be primarily derived from remnants of the primitive streak. Sacrococcygeal teratomas are benign 75% of the time, malignant 12% of the time, and the remainder are considered ""immature teratomas"" that share benign and malignant features. Benign sacrococcygeal teratomas are more likely to develop in younger children who are less than 5 months old, and older children are more likely to develop malignant sacrococcygeal teratomas.
The Currarino syndrome, due to an autosomal dominant mutation in the MNX1 gene, consists of a presacral mass (usually a mature teratoma or anterior meningocele), anorectal malformation and sacral dysgenesis.

=== Complications ===
Maternal complications of pregnancy may include mirror syndrome."
Nonfunctional Parathyroid Cyst,"Anterior neck mass, compressive symptoms, heterogeneous sizes of the mass, smooth surface, soft texture, sense of fluctuation, and absence of tenderness on palpation","Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous systems. They most commonly occur in the intestine, where they are often called carcinoid tumors, but they are also found in the pancreas, lung, and the rest of the body.
Although there are many kinds of NETs, they are treated as a group of tissue because the cells of these neoplasms share common features, including a similar histological appearance, having special secretory granules, and often producing biogenic amines and polypeptide hormones.
The term ""neuro"" refers to the dense core granules (DCGs), similar to the DCGs in the serotonergic neurons storing monoamines. The term ""endocrine"" refers to the synthesis and secretion of these monoamines."
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL),"Wasting, anemia, fatigue, weight loss, recurrent infections, tendency to bleed, superficial lymph node enlargement","Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. In CLL, the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell. In patients with CLL, B cell lymphocytes can begin to collect in their blood, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. These cells do not function well and crowd out healthy blood cells. CLL is divided into two main types:

Slow-growing CLL (indolent CLL)
Fast-growing CLL
Many people do not have any symptoms when they are first diagnosed."
Neonatal Fever,"Fever, irritability, crying, generalized skin flushing, oliguria","Neonatal sepsis is a type of neonatal infection and specifically refers to the presence in a newborn baby of a bacterial blood stream infection (BSI) (such as meningitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, or gastroenteritis) in the setting of fever. Older textbooks may refer to neonatal sepsis as ""sepsis neonatorum"". Criteria with regards to hemodynamic compromise or respiratory failure are not useful clinically because these symptoms often do not arise in neonates until death is imminent and unpreventable. Neonatal sepsis is divided into two categories: early-onset sepsis (EOS) and late-onset sepsis (LOS). EOS refers to sepsis presenting in the first 7 days of life (although some refer to EOS as within the first 72 hours of life), with LOS referring to presentation of sepsis after 7 days (or 72 hours, depending on the system used)."
Thyroid Cancer,"Thyroid nodules, painless lump, hoarseness, difficulty speaking, difficulty swallowing, enlarged and tender submandibular lymph nodes, facial edema","Thyroid cancer is cancer that develops from the tissues of the thyroid gland. It is a disease in which cells grow abnormally and have the potential to spread to other parts of the body. Symptoms can include swelling or a lump in the neck, difficulty swallowing or voice changes including hoarseness, or a feeling of something being in the throat due to mass effect from the tumor. However, most cases are asymptomatic. Cancer can also occur in the thyroid after spread from other locations, in which case it is not classified as thyroid cancer."
Keratosis Pilaris Rubra,"Cystic hard pointed papules with a central black horn, often densely clustered together, accompanied by a scaly, dandruff-like surface, varying degrees of itching, dryness, and a burning sensation.","Keratosis pilaris  (KP; also follicular keratosis, lichen pilaris, or colloquially chicken skin.) is a common, autosomal-dominant, genetic condition of the skin's hair follicles characterized by the appearance of possibly itchy, small, gooseflesh-like bumps, with varying degrees of reddening or inflammation. It most often appears on the outer sides of the upper arms (the forearms can also be affected), thighs, face, back, and buttocks; KP can also occur on the hands, and tops of legs, sides, or any body part except glabrous (hairless) skin (like the palms or soles of feet). Often the lesions can appear on the face, which may be mistaken for acne or folliculitis.
The several types of KP have been associated with pregnancy, type 1 diabetes mellitus, obesity, dry skin, allergic diseases (e.g., atopic dermatitis), and rarely cancer. Many rarer types of the disorder are part of inherited genetic syndromes."
Intracranial Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM),"Bleeding, seizures, headache, heart failure, hydrocephalus","A cerebral arteriovenous malformation (cerebral AVM, CAVM, cAVM, brain AVM, or BAVM) is an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in the brainspecifically, an arteriovenous malformation in the cerebrum.


== Signs and symptoms ==
The most frequently observed problems related to a cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) are headaches and seizures, cranial nerve afflictions including pinched nerve and palsy, backaches, neckaches, and nausea from coagulated blood that has made its way down to be dissolved in the cerebrospinal fluid. Perhaps 15% of the population at detection are asymptomatic. Other common symptoms are a pulsing noise in the head, progressive weakness, numbness and vision changes as well as debilitating, excruciating pain.
In serious cases, blood vessels rupture and cause bleeding within the brain (intracranial hemorrhage)."
Acute Cor Pulmonale,"Difficulty breathing, chest tightness and palpitations, feeling of suffocation, coughing, coughing up dark red fresh blood sputum, anxiety, cold sweats, nausea and vomiting, fainting, decreased blood pressure","Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a blockage of an artery in the lungs by a substance that has moved from elsewhere in the body through the bloodstream (embolism). Symptoms of a PE may include shortness of breath, chest pain particularly upon breathing in, and coughing up blood. Symptoms of a blood clot in the leg may also be present, such as a red, warm, swollen, and painful leg. Signs of a PE include low blood oxygen levels, rapid breathing, rapid heart rate, and sometimes a mild fever. Severe cases can lead to passing out, abnormally low blood pressure, obstructive shock, and sudden death."
Still's Disease,"Sore throat, high fever, decreased immunity","Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a form of Still's disease, a rare systemic autoinflammatory disease characterized by the classic triad of fevers, joint pain, and a distinctive salmon-colored bumpy rash. The disease is considered a diagnosis of exclusion. Levels of the iron-binding protein ferritin may be extremely elevated with this disorder. AOSD may present in a similar manner to other inflammatory diseases and to autoimmune diseases, which must be ruled out before making the diagnosis.
Prognosis is usually favorable but manifestations of the disease affecting the lungs, heart, or kidneys may occasionally cause severe life-threatening complications."
Asymptomatic Cerebral Infarction,"Headache, dizziness, limb numbness, memory decline, sleep disturbances, depression","A silent stroke (or asymptomatic cerebral infarction) is a stroke that does not have any outward symptoms associated with stroke, and the patient is typically unaware they have suffered a stroke. Despite not causing identifiable symptoms, a silent stroke still causes damage to the brain and places the patient at increased risk for both transient ischemic attack and major stroke in the future. In a broad study in 1998, more than 11 million people were estimated to have experienced a stroke in the United States. Approximately 770,000 of these strokes were symptomatic and 11 million were first-ever silent MRI infarcts or hemorrhages. Silent strokes typically cause lesions which are detected via the use of neuroimaging such as MRI. The risk of silent stroke increases with age but may also affect younger adults."
Acute Infections in Elderly Cancer Patients,"Delayed response, cough, expectoration, granulocytopenia, rales, urinary tract infection, immunodeficiency, frequent urination","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal cells that build up in the bone marrow and blood and interfere with normal blood cell production. Symptoms may include feeling tired, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. Occasionally, spread may occur to the brain, skin, or gums. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly, and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.
Risk factors include getting older, being male, smoking, previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy, myelodysplastic syndrome, and exposure to the chemical benzene."
Malignant Melanoma,"Skin moles, pigmented skin lesions","Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer; it develops from the  melanin-producing cells known as melanocytes. It typically occurs in the skin, but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye (uveal melanoma). In very rare cases melanoma can also happen in the lung which is known as primary pulmonary melanoma and only happens in 0.01% of primary lung tumors.
In women, melanomas most commonly occur on the legs; while in men, on the back. Melanoma is frequently referred to as malignant melanoma."
Hepatorenal Syndrome,"Hematuria, jaundice, spider angiomas, palmar erythema, splenomegaly, ascites, edema of legs and feet, eyelid edema","Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a life-threatening medical condition that consists of rapid deterioration in kidney function in individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. HRS is usually fatal unless a liver transplant is performed, although various treatments, such as dialysis, can prevent advancement of the condition.
HRS can affect individuals with cirrhosis, severe alcoholic hepatitis, or liver failure, and usually occurs when liver function deteriorates rapidly because of a sudden insult such as an infection, bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, or overuse of diuretic medications.  HRS is a relatively common complication of cirrhosis, occurring in 18% of people within one year of their diagnosis, and in 39% within five years of their diagnosis. Deteriorating liver function is believed to cause changes in the circulation that supplies the intestines, altering blood flow and blood vessel tone in the kidneys."
Neurofibrosarcoma,"Limb swelling, limb pain","A malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a form of cancer of the connective tissue surrounding peripheral nerves. Given its origin and behavior it is classified as a sarcoma. About half the cases are diagnosed in people with neurofibromatosis; the lifetime risk for an MPNST in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 is 813%. MPNST with rhabdomyoblastomatous component are called malignant triton tumors.
The first-line treatment is surgical resection with wide margins."
Metastatic Calcinosis Cutis,"Papules, Skin Calcification, Ulcers","Calcinosis cutis is an uncommon condition marked by calcium buildup in the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Calcinosis cutis can range in intensity from little nodules in one area of the body to huge, crippling lesions affecting a vast portion of the body. Five kinds of the condition are typically distinguished: calciphylaxis, idiopathic calcification, iatrogenic calcification, dystrophic calcification, and metastatic calcification.
Tumors, inflammation, varicose veins, infections, connective tissue disease, hyperphosphatemia, and hypercalcemia can all lead to calcinosis. Systemic sclerosis is linked to calcineuris cutis."
Schwannoma,"Nodules, macules, papules, sensory disturbances, motor dysfunction, tenderness, facial muscle twitching, hoarseness","A schwannoma (or neurilemmoma) is a usually benign nerve sheath tumor composed of Schwann cells, which normally produce the insulating myelin sheath covering peripheral nerves.
Schwannomas are homogeneous tumors, consisting only of Schwann cells. The tumor cells always stay on the outside of the nerve, but the tumor itself may either push the nerve aside and/or up against a bony structure (thereby possibly causing damage). Schwannomas are relatively slow-growing. For reasons not yet understood, schwannomas are mostly benign and less than 1% become malignant, degenerating into a form of cancer known as neurofibrosarcoma."
Cervical Adenocarcinoma,"Increased vaginal discharge, watery or mucoid in character, abnormal vaginal bleeding","Cervical cancer is a cancer arising from the cervix or in any layer of the wall of the cervix. It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that can invade or spread to other parts of the body. Early on, typically no symptoms are seen. Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain or pain during sexual intercourse. While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer."
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID),"Increased vaginal discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, pain during sexual intercourse","Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), also known as pelvic inflammatory disorder, is an infection of the upper part of the female reproductive system, mainly the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often, there may be no symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present, may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, bleeding after sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long-term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.
The disease is caused by bacteria that spread from the vagina and cervix."
Orbital Sarcoma,"Inability of the eyeball to move freely, nausea, vomiting, and proptosis","A myeloid sarcoma (chloroma, granulocytic sarcoma,:744 extramedullary myeloid tumor) is a solid tumor composed of immature white blood cells called myeloblasts. A chloroma is an extramedullary manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia; in other words, it is a solid collection of leukemic cells occurring outside of the bone marrow.


== Types ==


=== In acute leukemia ===
Chloromas are rare; exact estimates of their prevalence are lacking, but they are uncommonly seen even by physicians specializing in the treatment of leukemia. Chloromas may be somewhat more common in patients with the following disease features:

FrenchAmericanBritish (FAB) classification class M2
WHO Classification (2016 revision) is a separate entity under the ""Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and related neoplasms""
those with specific cytogenetic abnormalities (e.g. t(8;21) or inv(16))
those whose myeloblasts express T-cell surface markers, CD13, or CD14
those with high peripheral white blood cell counts
However, even in patients with the above risk factors, chloroma remains an uncommon complication of acute myeloid leukemia."
Secondary Liver Cancer,"Fatigue, liver pain, abdominal distension, diarrhea, abdominal mass, jaundice, ascites","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer in adults and is currently the most common cause of death in people with cirrhosis. HCC is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.
HCC most commonly occurs in those with chronic liver disease especially those with cirrhosis or fibrosis, which occur in the setting of chronic liver injury and inflammation. HCC is rare in those without chronic liver disease. Chronic liver diseases which greatly increase the risk of HCC include hepatitis infection such as (hepatitis B, C or D), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), alcoholic liver disease, or exposure to toxins such as aflatoxin, or pyrrolizidine alkaloids.:870873 Certain diseases, such as hemochromatosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, markedly increase the risk of developing HCC. The five-year survival in those with HCC is 18%."
Kidney Cough,"Cough, expectoration, dull pain in the lumbar region, deafness, soreness of the waist and knees","A cough is a sudden expulsion of air through the large breathing passages which can help clear them of fluids, irritants, foreign particles and microbes. As a protective reflex, coughing can be repetitive with the cough reflex following three phases: an inhalation, a forced exhalation against a closed glottis, and a violent release of air from the lungs following opening of the glottis, usually accompanied by a distinctive sound.
Frequent coughing usually indicates the presence of a disease. Many viruses and bacteria benefit, from an evolutionary perspective, by causing the host to cough, which helps to spread the disease to new hosts. Irregular coughing is usually caused by a respiratory tract infection but can also be triggered by choking, smoking, air pollution, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, post-nasal drip, chronic bronchitis, lung tumors, heart failure and medications such as angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and beta blockers."
Leiomyosarcoma,Fever,"A leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a rare malignant (cancerous) smooth muscle tumor. The word is from  leio- 'smooth'  myo- 'muscle' and  sarcoma 'tumor of connective tissue'. The stomach, bladder, uterus, blood vessels, and intestines are examples of hollow organs made up of smooth muscles where LMS can be located; however, the uterus and abdomen are the most common sites.
Although leiomyosarcomas are rare, they belong to the more common types of soft-tissue sarcoma, representing 1020% of new cases. This type of cancer is more frequently diagnosed in adults as compared to children."
Persistent Atrial Fibrillation,"Palpitations, Dizziness, Discomfort in the precordial area","Atrial fibrillation (AF, AFib or A-fib) is an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) characterized by rapid and irregular beating of the atrial chambers of the heart. It often begins as short periods of abnormal beating, which become longer or continuous over time.  It may also start as other forms of arrhythmia such as atrial flutter that then transform into AF.
Episodes can be asymptomatic. Symptomatic episodes may involve heart palpitations, fainting, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, or shortness of breath. Atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, dementia, and stroke."
Acute Upper Respiratory Infection in Children,"Fever with chills, runny nose, nasal congestion, sore throat, headache, diarrhea, hoarseness, fatigue, muscle ache, loss of appetite, dry mouth","An upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is an illness caused by an acute infection, which involves the upper respiratory tract, including the nose, sinuses, pharynx, larynx or trachea. This commonly includes nasal obstruction, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, sinusitis, otitis media, and the common cold.:28 Most infections are viral in nature, and in other instances, the cause is bacterial. URTIs can also be fungal or helminthic in origin, but these are less common.:443445
In 2015, 17.2 billion cases of URTIs are estimated to have occurred. As of 2016, they caused about 3,000 deaths, down from 4,000 in 1990.


== Signs and symptoms ==

In uncomplicated colds, coughing and nasal discharge may persist for 14 days or more even after other symptoms have resolved."
Chronic Fibrosing Thyroiditis,"Enlarged thyroid, difficulty in breathing, difficulty in swallowing","IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD), formerly known as IgG4-related systemic disease, is a chronic inflammatory condition characterized by tissue infiltration with lymphocytes and IgG4-secreting plasma cells, various degrees of fibrosis (scarring) and a usually prompt response to oral steroids. In approximately 5170% of people with this disease, serum IgG4 concentrations are elevated during an acute phase.
It is a relapsing-remitting disease associated with a tendency to mass forming, tissue-destructive lesions in multiple sites, with a characteristic histopathological appearance in whichever site is involved. Inflammation and the deposition of connective tissue in affected anatomical sites can lead to organ dysfunction, organ failure, or even death if not treated.
Early detection is important to avoid organ damage and potentially serious complications."
Mediastinal Tumor,"Chest pain, chest tightness, cough, facial edema, edema, dysphagia","A mediastinal tumor is a tumor in the mediastinum, the cavity that separates the lungs from the rest of the chest. It contains the heart, esophagus, trachea, thymus, and aorta. The most common mediastinal masses are thymoma (20% of mediastinal tumors), usually found in the anterior mediastinum, followed by neurogenic Timor (1520%) located in the anterior mediastinum. Lung cancer typically spreads to the lymph nodes in the mediastinum.
The mediastinum has three main  parts: the anterior mediastinum (front), the middle mediastinum, and the posterior mediastinum (back)."
Anterior Spinal Artery Syndrome,"Lower back pain, sensory disturbances, gastrointestinal bloating, paralysis, persistent dull pain in the lower back","Anterior spinal artery syndrome (also known as ""anterior spinal cord syndrome"") is syndrome caused by ischemia of the area supplied by the  anterior spinal artery, resulting in loss of function of the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord. The region affected includes the descending  corticospinal tract, ascending spinothalamic tract, and autonomic fibers. It is characterized by a corresponding loss of motor function, loss of pain and temperature sensation, and hypotension.
Anterior spinal artery syndrome is the most common form of spinal cord infarction. The anterior spinal cord is at increased risk for infarction because it is supplied by the single anterior spinal artery and has little collateral circulation, unlike the posterior spinal cord which is supplied by two posterior spinal arteries."
Fulminant Hepatitis-like Syndrome,"Nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension, tendency to bleed, consciousness disturbances, jaundice, irritability, epistaxis (nosebleed), somnolence, coma, impaired liver function, vomiting blood, ascites","Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue. Some people or animals with hepatitis have no symptoms, whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hepatitis is acute if it resolves within six months, and chronic if it lasts longer than six months. Acute hepatitis can resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or (rarely) result in acute liver failure. Chronic hepatitis may progress to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer."
Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH),"Anorexia, nausea and vomiting, somnolence, seizures, stupor, coma","Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), also known as the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), is characterized by a physiologically inappropriate release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) either from the posterior pituitary gland, or an ectopic non-pituitary source, such as an ADH-secreting tumor in the lung. Unsuppressed ADH causes a physiologically inappropriate increase in solute-free water being reabsorbed by the tubules of the kidney to the venous circulation leading to hypotonic hyponatremia (a low plasma osmolality and low sodium levels).
The causes of SIADH are commonly grouped into categories including: central nervous system diseases that directly stimulate the hypothalamus to release ADH, various cancers that synthesize and secrete ectopic ADH, various lung diseases, numerous drugs (carbamazepine, cyclophosphamide, SSRIs) that may stimulate the release of ADH, vasopressin release, desmopressin release, oxytocin, or stimulation of vasopressin receptor 2 on the kidney (the site of ADH action). Inappropriate antidiuresis may also be due to acute stressors such as exercise, pain, severe nausea or during the post-operative state. In 1760% of people, the cause of inappropriate antidiuresis is never found."
Pediatric Amyloidosis,"hepatomegaly, renal enlargement, ascites, edema, cachexia, proteinuria, renal failure, orthostatic hypotension","Cardiomyopathy is a group of primary diseases of the heart muscle. Early on there may be few or no symptoms. As the disease worsens, shortness of breath, feeling tired, and swelling of the legs may occur, due to the onset of heart failure. An irregular heart beat and fainting may occur. Those affected are at an increased risk of sudden cardiac death."
Neonatal Hypothermia,"Rectal temperature ≤35°C, hypothermia, cold skin surface, decreased response","Mild total body hypothermia, induced by cooling a baby to 33-34C for three days after birth, is nowadays a standardized treatment after moderate to severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy in full-term and near to fullterm neonates. It has recently been proven to be the only medical intervention which reduces brain damage, and improves an infant's chance of survival and reduced disability. 
Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy has many causes and is defined essentially as the reduction in the supply of blood or oxygen to a baby's brain before, during, or even after birth.  It is a major cause of death and disability, occurring in approximately 23 per 1000 births and causing around 20% of all cases of cerebral palsy. A 2013 Cochrane review found that therapeutic hypothermia is useful in full term babies with encephalopathy."
Chronic Lead Poisoning,"Dizziness, headache, general weakness, impaired memory, sleep disturbances, frequent dreaming","Lead poisoning, also known as plumbism and saturnism, is a type of metal poisoning caused by lead in the body. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, irritability, memory problems, infertility, numbness and tingling in the hands and feet. It causes almost 10% of intellectual disability of otherwise unknown cause and can result in behavioral problems. Some of the effects are permanent. In severe cases, anemia, seizures, coma, or death may occur."
Schistosomiasis,"Fever, dysuria, hematuria, headache, urinary urgency, bladder irritation, chills, fatigue, hyperhidrosis, hepatosplenomegaly, liver fibrosis, palpitations","Schistosomiasis, also known as snail fever, bilharzia, and Katayama fever is a disease caused by parasitic flatworms called schistosomes. It affects the urinary tract or the intestines. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, or blood in the urine. Those who have been infected for a long time may experience liver damage, kidney failure, infertility, or bladder cancer. In children, schistosomiasis may cause poor growth and learning difficulties."
Pearly Penile Papules,"Pearl-like, milky white papules, itching","Pearly penile papules (PPP; also known as hirsutoid papillomas or as papillae coronae glandis, Latin for 'papillae of the corona of the glans') are benign, small bumps or spots on the human penis. They vary in size from 0.5-1 mm, are pearly or flesh-colored, smooth and dome-topped or filiform, and appear in one or, several rows around the corona, the ridge of the head of the penis and sometimes on the penile shaft. They are painless, non-cancerous and not harmful. The medical condition of having such papules is called hirsutoid papillomatosis or hirsuties papillaris coronae glandis (Latin for 'papillary hirsutism of the corona of the glans').


== Cause and mechanism ==

PPPs are a type of angiofibroma."
Esophageal Injury,"Dysphagia, esophageal bleeding, vomiting, chest pain, subcutaneous emphysema, lower chest pain, subcutaneous emphysema in the lower neck area","Esophageal diseases can derive from congenital conditions, or they can be acquired later in life.
Many people experience a burning sensation in their chest occasionally, caused by stomach acids refluxing into the esophagus, normally called heartburn. Extended exposure to heartburn may erode the lining of the esophagus, leading potentially to Barrett's esophagus which is associated with an increased risk of adenocarcinoma most commonly found in the distal one-third of the esophagus.
Some people also experience a sensation known as globus esophagus, where it feels as if a ball is lodged in the lower part of the esophagus.
The following are additional diseases and conditions that affect the esophagus:

Achalasia
Acute esophageal necrosis
Barrett's esophagus
Boerhaave syndrome
Caustic injury to the esophagus
Chagas disease
Diffuse esophageal spasm
Esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula
Esophageal cancer

Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS),"Chest pain, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing","Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a syndrome due to decreased blood flow in the coronary arteries such that part of the heart muscle is unable to function properly or dies. The most common symptom is centrally located pressure-like chest pain, often radiating to the left shoulder or angle of the jaw, and associated with nausea and sweating. Many people with acute coronary syndromes present with symptoms other than chest pain, particularly women, older people, and people with diabetes mellitus.
Acute coronary syndrome is subdivided in three scenarios depending primarily on the presence of electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and blood test results (a change in cardiac biomarkers such as troponin levels): ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), or unstable angina. STEMI is characterized by complete blockage of a coronary artery resulting in necrosis of part of the heart muscle indicated by ST elevation on ECG, NSTEMI is characterized by a partially blocked coronary artery resulting in necrosis of part of the heart muscle that may be indicated by ECG changes, and unstable angina is characterised by ischemia of the heart muscle that does not result in cell injury or necrosis."
Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA),"Monoplegia, hemiplegia, sensory disturbances, visual impairments, vertigo, motor aphasia, dysphagia, hoarseness, decreased hearing, limb weakness, memory loss, consciousness disorders","A transient ischemic attack (TIA), commonly known as a mini-stroke, is a temporary (transient) stroke with noticeable symptoms that end within 24 hours. A TIA causes the same symptoms associated with a stroke, such as weakness or numbness on one side of the body, sudden dimming or loss of vision, difficulty speaking or understanding language or slurred speech.
All forms of stroke, including a TIA, result from a disruption in blood flow to the central nervous system.  A TIA is caused by a temporary disruption in blood flow to the brain, or cerebral blood flow (CBF).  The primary difference between a major stroke and the TIA's minor stroke is how much tissue death (infarction) can be detected afterwards through medical imaging."
Chronic Angle-Closure Glaucoma,"Elevated intraocular pressure, visual field defects, eye pain, conjunctival congestion, rainbow vision disturbances, eye fatigue, pupil deformation, and eyeball protrusion","Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can lead to damage of the optic nerve. The optic nerve transmits visual information from the eye to the brain. Glaucoma may cause vision loss if left untreated. It has been called the ""silent thief of sight"" because the loss of vision usually occurs slowly over a long period of time. A major risk factor for glaucoma is increased pressure within the eye, known as intraocular pressure (IOP)."
Elbow Ankylosis and Fibrous Stiffness,"Stiffness, ankylosis, limited flexion and extension, severe elbow joint dysfunction","Fibrous ankylosis (also known as false ankylosis) is a condition that affects fibrous connective tissue causing a limited range of movement. 
Most causes occurs due to physical trauma.  Other cases can be attributed to the contraction of diseases such as tubercular arthritis, (arthritis developed after contracting tuberculosis), or septic arthritis.  Surgery, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, immobilization are also cases of this condition.  Fibrous ankylosis was thought to be a precursor progress into bony ankylosis,  in which osseous bone tissue fuses the affected joint, causing a greater reduction of mobility."
Dermoid Cyst and Epidermoid Cyst,"Subcutaneous cysts, back pain, cystic changes","A dermoid cyst is a teratoma of a cystic nature that contains an array of developmentally mature, solid tissues. It frequently consists of skin, hair follicles, and sweat glands, while other commonly found components include clumps of long hair, pockets of sebum, blood, fat, bone, nail, teeth, eyes, cartilage, and thyroid tissue.
As dermoid cysts grow slowly and contain mature tissue, this type of cystic teratoma is nearly always benign. In those rare cases wherein the dermoid cyst is malignant, a squamous cell carcinoma usually develops in adults, while infants and children usually present with an endodermal sinus tumor.:781


== Location ==
Due to its classification, a dermoid cyst can occur wherever a teratoma can occur.


=== Vaginal and ovarian dermoid cysts ===
Ovaries normally grow cyst-like structures called follicles each month."
Kaposi's Sarcoma,"Idiopathic, multifocal, pigmented sarcoma of the skin","Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a type of cancer that can form masses on the skin, in lymph nodes, in the mouth, or in other organs. The skin lesions are usually painless, purple and may be flat or raised. Lesions can occur singly, multiply in a limited area, or may be widespread. Depending on the sub-type of disease and level of immune suppression, KS may worsen either gradually or quickly. Except for classic KS where there is generally no immune suppression, KS is caused by a combination of immune suppression (such as due to HIV/AIDS) and infection by Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8  also called KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV))."
Mollaret's Meningitis in Children,"Recurrent headaches, nausea and vomiting, diplopia, hallucinations, myalgia, back pain, coma, seizures, neck stiffness, signs of meningeal irritation, meningitis","Viral meningitis, also known as aseptic meningitis, is a type of meningitis due to a viral infection. It results in inflammation of the meninges (the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord). Symptoms commonly include headache, fever, sensitivity to light and neck stiffness. 
Viruses are the most common cause of aseptic meningitis. Most cases of viral meningitis are caused by enteroviruses (common stomach viruses)."
Tubo-ovarian abscess,"Lower abdominal pain, low fever, lumbosacral soreness, sensation of heaviness, recurrent dyspareunia that worsens with fatigue and after menstruation, increased purulent vaginal discharge","A tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) is one of the late complications of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and can be life-threatening if the abscess ruptures and results in sepsis. It consists of an encapsulated or confined pocket of pus with defined boundaries that forms during an infection of a fallopian tube and ovary. These abscesses are found most commonly in reproductive age women and typically result from upper genital tract infection. It is an inflammatory mass involving the fallopian tube, ovary and, occasionally, other adjacent pelvic organs. A TOA can also develop as a complication of a hysterectomy.:103
Symptoms typically include fever, an elevated white blood cell count, lower abdominal-pelvic pain, and/or vaginal discharge."
Junctional Escape Beat and Rhythm,"Tachycardia, Sinus Arrest, Shortness of Breath, Palpitations, Arrhythmia, Atrioventricular Block, Syncope","Junctional rhythm also called nodal rhythm describes an abnormal heart rhythm resulting from impulses coming from a locus of tissue in the area of the atrioventricular node (AV node), the ""junction"" between atria and ventricles.
Under normal conditions, the heart's sinoatrial node (SA node) determines the rate by which the organ beats  in other words, it is the heart's ""pacemaker"". The electrical activity of sinus rhythm originates in the sinoatrial node and depolarizes the atria. Current then passes from the atria through the atrioventricular node and into the bundle of His, from which it travels along Purkinje fibers to reach and depolarize the ventricles. This sinus rhythm is important because it ensures that the heart's atria reliably contract before the ventricles, ensuring as optimal stroke volume and cardiac output."
Unstable Angina in the Elderly,"Precordial pain, a sense of oppression, palpitations, chest tightness, radiating pain to the shoulders, back, arms, and jaw, and profuse sweating","Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a syndrome due to decreased blood flow in the coronary arteries such that part of the heart muscle is unable to function properly or dies. The most common symptom is centrally located pressure-like chest pain, often radiating to the left shoulder or angle of the jaw, and associated with nausea and sweating. Many people with acute coronary syndromes present with symptoms other than chest pain, particularly women, older people, and people with diabetes mellitus.
Acute coronary syndrome is subdivided in three scenarios depending primarily on the presence of electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and blood test results (a change in cardiac biomarkers such as troponin levels): ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), or unstable angina.

Superior Mesenteric Artery Thrombosis,"Symptoms include postprandial diffuse abdominal colic, emaciation, oliguria, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, increased stool volume, and weight loss.","Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome is a gastro-vascular disorder in which the third and final portion of the duodenum is compressed between the abdominal aorta (AA) and the overlying superior mesenteric artery.  This rare, potentially life-threatening syndrome is typically caused by an angle of 625 between the AA and the SMA, in comparison to the normal range of 3856, due to a lack of retroperitoneal and visceral fat (mesenteric fat). In addition, the aortomesenteric distance is 28 millimeters, as opposed to the typical 1020. However, a narrow SMA angle alone is not enough to make a diagnosis, because patients with a low BMI, most notably children, have been known to have a narrow SMA angle with no symptoms of SMA syndrome.
SMA syndrome is also known as Wilkie's syndrome, cast syndrome, mesenteric root syndrome, chronic duodenal ileus and intermittent arterio-mesenteric occlusion."
Allergic Colitis,"Abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, mucous stools, headache, fatigue, insomnia, palpitations, sweating","Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI or C-diff), also known as Clostridium difficile infection, is a symptomatic infection due to the spore-forming bacterium Clostridioides difficile. Symptoms include watery diarrhea, fever, nausea, and abdominal pain. It makes up about 20% of cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  Antibiotics can contribute to detrimental changes in gut microbiota; specifically, they decrease short-chain fatty acid absorption which results in osmotic, or watery, diarrhea. Complications may include pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon, perforation of the colon, and sepsis."
Neonatal Group B Streptococcus Infection,"Asphyxia, shock, neonatal cyanosis, abnormal respiration, coma, convulsions, recurrent high fever, cellulitis, secondary infections","Group B streptococcal infection, also known as Group B streptococcal disease or just Group B strep infection, is the infectious disease caused by the bacterium Streptococcus agalactiae. Streptococcus agalactiae is the most common human pathogen belonging to group B of the Lancefield classification of streptococcihence the name of group B stretococcal (GBS). Infection with GBS can cause serious illness and sometimes death, especially in newborns, the elderly, and people with compromised immune systems.
The most severe form of group B streptococcal disease is neonatal meningitis in infants, which is frequently lethal and can cause permanent neuro-cognitive impairment.

S. agalactiae was recognized as a pathogen in cattle by Edmond Nocard and Mollereau in the late 1880s."
Elderly Fatty Liver Disease,"Subclinical pain in the liver area, poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, diarrhea, impotence, nosebleeds, spider angiomas, and gynecomastia in males","Atherosclerosis is a pattern of the disease arteriosclerosis, characterized by development of abnormalities called lesions in walls of arteries. This is a chronic inflammatory disease involving many different cell types and is driven by elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood. These lesions may lead to narrowing of the arterial walls due to buildup of atheromatous plaques. At the onset there are usually no symptoms, but if they develop, symptoms generally begin around middle age. In severe cases, it can result in coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or kidney disorders, depending on which body part(s) the affected arteries are located in the body."
Spinal Vascular Disease,"Pain of varying degrees related to the lesion site, paraplegia, paralysis of the lower limbs, loss of sensation, urinary and fecal incontinence","Spinal cord stroke is a rare type of stroke with compromised blood flow to any region of spinal cord owing to occlusion or bleeding, leading to irreversible neuronal death. It can be classified into two types, ischaemia and haemorrhage, in which the former accounts for 86% of all cases, a pattern similar to cerebral stroke. The disease is either arisen spontaneously from aortic illnesses or postoperatively. It deprives patients of motor function or sensory function, and sometimes both. Infarction usually occurs in regions perfused by anterior spinal artery, which spans the anterior two-thirds of spinal cord."
Intestinal Polyps,"Hematochezia, mucous stools, constipation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, intussusception, colic, gastrointestinal bleeding","A polyp is an abnormal growth of tissue projecting from a mucous membrane. If it is attached to the surface by a narrow elongated stalk, it is said to be pedunculated; if it is attached without a stalk, it is said to be sessile. 
Polyps are commonly found in the colon, stomach, nose, ear, sinus(es), urinary bladder, and uterus. They may also occur elsewhere in the body where there are mucous membranes, including the cervix, vocal folds, and small intestine. Some polyps are tumors (neoplasms) and others are non-neoplastic, for example hyperplastic or dysplastic, which are benign."
Pediatric Neuro-Behet's Syndrome,,"Anti-Hu associated encephalitis, also known as Anti-ANNA1 associated encephalitis, is an uncommon form of brain inflammation that is associated with an underlying cancer. It can cause psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and hallucinations. It can also produce neurological symptoms such as confusion, memory loss, weakness, sensory loss, pain, seizures, and problems coordinating the movement of the body.
While its cause is unknown, the most common hypothesis is that it is caused by an immune system attack on the nervous system. This immune system attack is linked to cancer in most cases, usually small cell lung carcinoma."
Watershed Cerebral Infarction,"Consciousness disturbance, motor aphasia, hemianopia, sensory disturbance, basal ganglia hemorrhage, nausea and vomiting, brain dysfunction, coma, loss of light reflex, paralysis, central fever, delirium","A watershed stroke is defined as a brain ischemia that is localized to the vulnerable border zones between the tissues supplied by the anterior, posterior and middle cerebral arteries.  The actual blood stream blockage/restriction site can be located far away from the infarcts. Watershed locations are those border-zone regions in the brain supplied by the major cerebral arteries where blood supply is decreased. Watershed strokes are a concern because they comprise approximately 10% of all ischemic stroke cases. The watershed zones themselves are particularly susceptible to infarction from global ischemia as the distal nature of the vasculature predisposes these areas to be most sensitive to profound hypoperfusion."
Shock and Collapse,"Shortness of breath, cold extremities, profuse sweating, unconsciousness, unresponsiveness","Shock is the state of insufficient blood flow to the tissues of the body as a result of problems with the circulatory system. Initial symptoms of shock may include weakness, tachycardia, hyperventilation, sweating, anxiety, and increased thirst. This may be followed by confusion, unconsciousness, or cardiac arrest, as complications worsen.
Shock is divided into four main types based on the underlying cause: hypovolemic, cardiogenic, obstructive, and distributive shock. Hypovolemic shock, also known as low volume shock, may be from bleeding, diarrhea, or vomiting."
Aggressive Infantile Fibromatosis,"Constipation, rectal bleeding, intestinal dysfunction, congestion, nausea, delayed response, peritoneal irritation signs, abdominal pain","Aggressive fibromatosis or desmoid tumor is a rare condition. Desmoid tumors are a type of fibromatosis and related to sarcoma, though without the ability to spread throughout the body (metastasize). The tumors arise from cells called fibroblasts, which are found throughout the body and provide structural support, protection to the vital organs, and play a critical role in wound healing. These tumors tend to occur in women in their thirties, but can occur in anyone at any age. They can be either relatively slow-growing or malignant."
Cervical Penetrating Injury,"Cyanosis, sensory disorder, high paraplegia, dyspnea, severe pain, open injury, cough, twisted pronunciation","A cervical fracture, commonly called a broken neck, is a fracture of any of the seven cervical vertebrae in the neck. Examples of common causes in humans are traffic collisions and diving into shallow water. Abnormal movement of neck bones or pieces of bone can cause a spinal cord injury, resulting in loss of sensation, paralysis, or usually death soon thereafter (~1 min.), primarily via compromising neurological supply to the respiratory muscles and innervation to the heart.


== Causes ==

Considerable force is needed to cause a cervical fracture. Vehicle collisions and falls are common causes."
Aortic Dissection,"Severe pain, frontal headache, neck pain, scapular referral pain, rapid heart rate, angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, dissection hematoma, dizziness, confusion, paraplegia, abdominal pain","Aortic dissection (AD) occurs when an injury to the innermost layer of the aorta allows blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall, forcing the layers apart. In most cases, this is associated with a sudden onset of agonizing chest or back pain, often described as ""tearing"" in character. Vomiting, sweating, and lightheadedness may also occur. Damage to other organs may result from the decreased blood supply, such as stroke, lower extremity ischemia, or mesenteric ischemia. Aortic dissection can quickly lead to death from insufficient blood flow to the heart or complete rupture of the aorta."
Vaginal Sarcoma Botryoides,"Vaginal bleeding, increased vaginal discharge, bloody vaginal discharge, vaginal expulsion of tissue fragments, lower abdominal tenderness","Sarcoma botryoides or botryoid sarcoma is a subtype of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, that can be observed in the walls of hollow, mucosa lined structures such as the nasopharynx, common bile duct, urinary bladder of infants and young children or the vagina in females, typically younger than age 8. The name comes from Ancient Greek  botryoid 'grape bunch' due to their gross appearance.


== Presentation ==
For botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma of the vagina, the most common clinical finding is vaginal bleeding but vaginal bleeding is not specific for sarcoma botryoides:  other vaginal cancers are possible. They may appear as a polypoid mass, somewhat yellow in color and are friable: thus, they (possibly) may break off, leading to vaginal bleeding or infections.


== Histology ==
Under the microscope one can see rhabdomyoblasts that may contain cross-striations."
Transitional Cell Carcinoma of the Bladder,Painless gross hematuria,"Transitional cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that arises from the transitional epithelium, a tissue lining the inner surface of these hollow organs. It typically occurs in the urothelium of the urinary system; in that case, it is also called urothelial carcinoma. It is the most common type of bladder cancer and cancer of the ureter, urethra, and urachus. Symptoms of urothelial carcinoma in the bladder include hematuria (blood in the urine). Diagnosis includes urine analysis and imaging of the urinary tract (cystoscopy)."
Syringocystadenoma Papilliferum,"Increased sweating upon cold exposure, noticeable body odor, lactation disorder, subcutaneous nodules","Syringocystadenoma papilliferum is a rare non-malignant adnexal neoplasm that develops from apocrine or eccrine sweat glands and can be identified histologically by cystic, papillary, and ductal invaginations into the dermis lined by double-layered outer cuboidal and luminal high columnar epithelium and connected to the epidermis.
Lesions have a heterogeneous, non-distinctive appearance that ranges from skin-colored to pink-colored papules or plaques. Typically, lesions form in the head and neck area.
Syringocystadenoma papilliferum can develop de-novo or within a nevus sebaceous. Syringocystadenoma papilliferum tends to be seen in children."
Gallbladder Polyps,"Pain in the upper right abdomen radiating to the right shoulder back, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite in young and middle-aged individuals.","Gallbladder polyps are growths or lesions resembling growths (polypoid lesions) in the wall of the gallbladder. True polyps are abnormal accumulations of mucous membrane tissue that would normally be shed by the body.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Most polyps do not cause noticeable symptoms. Gallbladder polyps are usually found incidentally when examining the abdomen by ultrasound for other conditions, usually abdominal pain.


== Pathology ==
Most small polyps (less than 1 cm) are not cancerous and may remain unchanged for years."
Temporomandibular Joint Disorders,"Pain in the temporomandibular joint, worsened while opening the mouth or chewing, with accompanying clicking, grinding sounds, difficulty opening the mouth, and limited mouth opening","Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD, TMJD) is an umbrella term covering pain and dysfunction of the muscles of mastication (the muscles that move the jaw) and the temporomandibular joints (the joints which connect the mandible to the skull). The most important feature is pain, followed by restricted mandibular movement, and noises from the temporomandibular joints (TMJ) during jaw movement. Although TMD is not life-threatening, it can be detrimental to quality of life; this is because the symptoms can become chronic and difficult to manage.
In this article, the term temporomandibular disorder is taken to mean any disorder that affects the temporomandibular joint, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction (here also abbreviated to TMD) is taken to mean symptomatic (e.g. pain, limitation of movement, clicking) dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint."
Salivary Gland Cyst,"Submucosal swelling in the oral cavity, purulent discharge","Salivary gland tumours, or neoplasms, are tumours that form in the tissues of salivary glands. The salivary glands are classified as major or minor. The major salivary glands consist of the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. The minor salivary glands consist of 800 to 1000 small mucus-secreting glands located throughout the lining of the oral cavity. People with these types of tumours may be asymptomatic."
Extramammary Paget's Disease,"Localized itching or minor burning sensation of the nipple, reddening of the skin around the nipple and areola, serous exudation, mild erosion, thickening and hardening of the skin in some patients","Paget's disease of the breast (also known as mammary Paget's disease) is a rare skin change at the nipple nearly always associated with underlying breast cancer. Paget's disease of the breast was first described by Sir James Paget in 1874. The condition is an uncommon disease accounting for 1 to 4% of all breast cancers cases. 92% to 100% of patients with Paget's disease of the breast have an underlying breast cancer.
The condition in itself often appears innocuous, limited to a surface appearance and it is sometimes dismissed, although it is actually indicative of underlying breast cancer."
Avascular Necrosis,"Discomfort in the hip, hip pain, increased pain after fatigue or long periods of activity, alleviation of pain after rest, pain in the lumbar sacral region or knee joint","Avascular necrosis (AVN), also called osteonecrosis or bone infarction, is death of bone tissue due to interruption of the blood supply. Early on, there may be no symptoms. Gradually joint pain may develop, which may limit the person's ability to move. Complications may include collapse of the bone or nearby joint surface.
Risk factors include bone fractures, joint dislocations, alcoholism, and the use of high-dose steroids."
Hepatorenal Syndrome,"Hematuria, jaundice, spider angiomas, palmar erythema, splenomegaly, ascites, edema of legs and feet, eyelid edema","Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a life-threatening medical condition that consists of rapid deterioration in kidney function in individuals with cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure. HRS is usually fatal unless a liver transplant is performed, although various treatments, such as dialysis, can prevent advancement of the condition.
HRS can affect individuals with cirrhosis, severe alcoholic hepatitis, or liver failure, and usually occurs when liver function deteriorates rapidly because of a sudden insult such as an infection, bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, or overuse of diuretic medications.  HRS is a relatively common complication of cirrhosis, occurring in 18% of people within one year of their diagnosis, and in 39% within five years of their diagnosis. Deteriorating liver function is believed to cause changes in the circulation that supplies the intestines, altering blood flow and blood vessel tone in the kidneys."
Heart Failure,"Orthopnea, tachycardia, restlessness, pink frothy sputum, syncope, chest pain with tightness, palpitations, pitting edema in both lower limbs","Heart failure (HF), also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), is a syndrome caused by an impairment in the heart's ability to fill with and pump blood.
Although symptoms vary based on which side of the heart is affected, HF typically presents with shortness of breath, excessive fatigue, and bilateral leg swelling. The severity of the heart failure is mainly decided based on ejection fraction and also measured by the severity of symptoms. Other conditions that have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver disease, anemia, and thyroid disease.
Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excessive alcohol consumption, infection, and cardiomyopathy."
Congenital Rubella Syndrome,"Thrombocytopenic purpura, hepatosplenomegaly, maculopapular rash, congenital heart defects, heart failure, intrauterine growth retardation, cataracts, skin petechiae, deafness, miscarriage, stillbirth, fever","Congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) occurs when a human fetus is infected with the rubella virus (German measles) via maternal-fetal transmission and develops birth defects. The most common congenital defects affect the ophthalmologic, cardiac, auditory, and neurologic systems.
Rubella infection in pregnancy can result in various outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to congenital defects to miscarriage and fetal death. If infection occurs 011 weeks after conception, the infant has a 90% risk of being affected. If the infection occurs 1220 weeks after conception, the risk is 20%."
Basal Cell Carcinoma,"Headache, ulceration, nodules, erythematous rash, eczema, pain","Basal-cell carcinoma (BCC), also known as basal-cell cancer, basalioma or rodent ulcer, is the most common type of skin cancer. It often appears as a painless raised area of skin, which may be shiny with small blood vessels running over it. It may also present as a raised area with ulceration. Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it, but it is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death.
Risk factors include exposure to ultraviolet light, having lighter skin, radiation therapy, long-term exposure to arsenic and poor immune-system function."
Clustered Hemangioma,Papules,"Cherry angioma, also called cherry hemangioma or Campbell de Morgan Spot, is a small bright red dome-shaped bump on the skin. It ranges between 0.5 and 6 mm in diameter and usually several are present, typically on the chest and arms, and increasing in number with age. If scratched, they may bleed.
They are a harmless benign tumour, containing an abnormal proliferation of blood vessels, and have no relationship to cancer. They are the most common kind of angioma, and increase with age, occurring in nearly all adults over 30 years."
B Virus Infection,"Nasal congestion, fever, muscle soreness, sore throat","B-virus a virus of the genus Simplexvirus that infects macaque monkeys. B virus is very similar to Herpes simplex virus 1, and as such, this neurotropic virus is not found in the blood.
In the natural host, the virus exhibits pathogenesis similar to that of cold sores in humans. There have been a number of accidental infections and fatalities of researchers working with rhesus monkeys (Rhesus macaque). When humans are zoonotically infected with B virus, they can present with a severe encephalitis, resulting in permanent neurological dysfunction or death."
Pediatric Drug Hypersensitivity,"Maculopapular rash, exfoliative dermatitis, nodules, anemia, edema, shock, vasculitis, drug allergic reactions","Drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms or drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), also termed drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS), is a rare reaction to certain medications. It involves primarily a widespread skin rash, fever, swollen lymph nodes, and characteristic blood abnormalities such as an abnormally high level of eosinophils, low number of platelets, and increased number of atypical white blood cells (lymphocytes). However, DRESS is often complicated by potentially life-threatening inflammation of internal organs and the syndrome has about a 10% mortality rate. Treatment consists of stopping the offending medication and providing supportive care. Systemic corticosteroids are commonly used as well but no controlled clinical trials have assessed the efficacy of this treatment."
Pediatric Ataxia-Telangiectasia Syndrome,"Ataxia, Intellectual Developmental Delay","Ataxiatelangiectasia (AT or AT), also referred to as ataxiatelangiectasia syndrome or LouisBar syndrome, is a rare, neurodegenerative disease causing severe disability. Ataxia refers to poor coordination and telangiectasia to small dilated blood vessels, both of which are hallmarks of the disease. AT affects many parts of the body:

It impairs certain areas of the brain including the cerebellum, causing difficulty with movement and coordination.
It weakens the immune system, causing a predisposition to infection.
It prevents the repair of broken DNA, increasing the risk of cancer."
Epithelioid Sarcoma,"Subcutaneous nodules, ulcers, gradual infiltration toward deeper layers, infiltration along fascia, tendons, and nerves","Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare soft tissue sarcoma arising from mesenchymal tissue and characterized by epithelioid-like features. It accounts for less than 1% of all soft tissue sarcomas. It was first definitively characterized by F.M. Enzinger in 1970. It commonly presents itself in the distal limbs (fingers, hands, forearms, or feet) of young adults as a small, soft mass or a cluster of bumps. A proximal version has also been described, frequently occurring in the upper extremities."
Intraspinal Metastatic Tumors,"Radicular pain, radiation from the back, coughing, sneezing, aggravated by exertion, significant at night, paraplegia in cases involving the spinal cord","A brain tumor (sometimes referred more commonly as brain cancer) occurs when a group of cells within the brain turn cancerous and grow out of control, creating a mass. There are two main types of tumors: malignant (cancerous) tumors and benign (non-cancerous) tumors. These can be further classified as primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which most commonly have spread from tumors located outside the brain, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the size of the tumor and the part of the brain that is involved. Where symptoms exist, they may include headaches, seizures, problems with vision, vomiting and mental changes."
Pituitary Adenoma,"Amenorrhea, galactorrhea, infertility, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, breast development, sparse facial hair, headache","Pituitary adenomas are tumors that occur in the pituitary gland. Most pituitary tumors are benign, approximately 35% are invasive and just 0.1% to 0.2% are carcinomas. Pituitary adenomas represent from 10% to 25% of all intracranial neoplasms, with an estimated prevalence rate in the general population of approximately 17%.
Non-invasive and non-secreting pituitary adenomas are considered to be benign in the literal as well as the clinical sense, though a 2011 meta-analysis of available research showed that research to either support or refute this assumption was scant and of questionable quality.
Adenomas exceeding 10 mm (0.39 in) in size are defined as macroadenomas, while those smaller than 10 mm (0.39 in) are referred to as microadenomas."
Temporomandibular Joint Disorder,"Pain in the temporomandibular joint, pain in the masticatory muscles, audible friction sounds, and clicking","Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD, TMJD) is an umbrella term covering pain and dysfunction of the muscles of mastication (the muscles that move the jaw) and the temporomandibular joints (the joints which connect the mandible to the skull). The most important feature is pain, followed by restricted mandibular movement, and noises from the temporomandibular joints (TMJ) during jaw movement. Although TMD is not life-threatening, it can be detrimental to quality of life; this is because the symptoms can become chronic and difficult to manage.
In this article, the term temporomandibular disorder is taken to mean any disorder that affects the temporomandibular joint, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction (here also abbreviated to TMD) is taken to mean symptomatic (e.g. pain, limitation of movement, clicking) dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint."
Idiopathic Delayed Hypogammaglobulinemia,"Ulcers, Splenomegaly","Multiple myeloma (MM), also known as plasma cell myeloma and simply myeloma, is a cancer of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell that normally produces antibodies. Often, no symptoms are noticed initially. As it progresses, bone pain, anemia, renal insufficiency, and infections may occur. Complications may include hypercalcemia and amyloidosis.
The cause of multiple myeloma is unknown."
Bone Metastatic Cancer,Pain in lower back and legs,"Metastatic breast cancer, also referred to as metastases, advanced breast cancer, secondary tumors, secondaries or stage IV breast cancer, is a stage of breast cancer where the breast cancer cells have spread to distant sites beyond the axillary lymph nodes. There is no cure for metastatic breast cancer;  there is no stage after IV.
Metastases can occur several years after the primary breast cancer, although it is sometimes diagnosed at the same time as the primary breast cancer or, rarely, before the primary breast cancer has been diagnosed.
Metastatic breast cancer cells frequently differ from the preceding primary breast cancer in properties such as receptor status. The cells have often developed resistance to several lines of previous treatment and have acquired special properties that permit them to metastasize to distant sites. Metastatic breast cancer can be treated, sometimes for many years, but it cannot be cured."
Cardiac Papillary Fibroelastoma,"heart failure, unexplained fever, angina, hemiparesis, transient cerebral ischemia, myocardial infarction","A papillary fibroelastoma is a primary tumor of the heart that typically involves one of the heart valves. Papillary fibroelastomas, while considered uncommon, make up about 10 percent of all primary tumors of the heart. They are the third most common type of primary tumor of the heart, behind cardiac myxomas and cardiac lipomas.


== Signs and symptoms ==
A papillary fibroelastoma is generally considered pathologically benign, however outflow obstruction or embolism can be associated with syncope, chest pain, heart attack, stroke and sudden cardiac death.
Symptoms due to papillary fibroelastomas are generally due to either mechanical effects of the tumor or due to embolization of a portion of the tumor to a distal organ."
Gastric Perforation,"Sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, cutting or burning sensation, intermittent exacerbation, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, constipation, pneumoperitoneum, abdominal wall tenderness, rebound tenderness, muscle tension","Gastrointestinal perforation, also known as gastrointestinal rupture, is a hole in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. The gastrointestinal tract is composed of hollow digestive organs leading from the mouth to the anus. Symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation commonly include severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Complications include a painful inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall and sepsis.
Perforation may be caused by trauma, bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, stomach ulcers, cancer, or infection."
Liver Tumor,"Pain in the liver area, decreased appetite, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, fever","Liver cancer, also known as hepatic cancer, primary hepatic cancer, or primary hepatic malignancy, is cancer that starts in the liver. Liver cancer can be primary in which the cancer starts in the liver, or it can be liver metastasis, or secondary, in which the cancer spreads from elsewhere in the body to the liver. Liver metastasis is the more common of the two liver cancers. Instances of liver cancer are increasing globally. 
Primary liver cancer is globally the sixth-most frequent cancer and the fourth-leading cause of death from cancer."
Hydrogen Sulfide Poisoning,"Tearing, rhinorrhea, coughing, ulcers, asphyxiation, eye pain, conjunctival congestion, dry rales, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, chest tightness","Hydrogen sulfide is a chemical compound with the formula H2S. It is a colorless chalcogen-hydride gas, and is toxic, corrosive, and flammable. Trace amounts in ambient atmosphere have a characteristic foul odor of rotten eggs.  Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele is credited with having discovered the chemical composition of purified hydrogen sulfide in 1777.
Hydrogen sulfide is toxic to humans and most other animals by inhibiting cellular respiration in a manner similar to hydrogen cyanide. When it is inhaled or its salts are ingested in high amounts, damage to organs occurs rapidly with symptoms ranging from breathing difficulties to convulsions and death."
Guillain-Barre Syndrome,"Weakness in both lower limbs, numbness in lower limbs, tingling sensation in the lower limbs, which in a few days ascends to the trunk and upper limbs, presenting as flaccid paralysis","GuillainBarr syndrome (GBS) is a rapid-onset muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. Typically, both sides of the body are involved, and the initial symptoms are changes in sensation or pain often in the back along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands, often spreading to the arms and upper body. The symptoms may develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening, with about 15% of people developing respiratory muscle weakness requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in the function of the autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure."
Acute and Subacute Intracerebral Hematoma,"Headache, Hemianopia, sensory disturbances affecting one side of the body, impaired consciousness, nausea and vomiting, hemiplegia, aphasia","A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a type of bleeding in which a collection of bloodusually but not always associated with a traumatic brain injurygathers between the inner layer of the dura mater and the arachnoid mater of the meninges surrounding the brain. It usually results from rips in bridging veins that cross the subdural space.
Subdural hematomas may cause an increase in the pressure inside the skull, which in turn can cause compression of and damage to delicate brain tissue. Acute subdural hematomas are often life-threatening. Chronic subdural hematomas have a better prognosis if properly managed."
Retropharyngeal Abscess,"Dehydration, difficulty swallowing, restlessness, refusal to eat, abscess, snoring, breathing difficulty, sore throat","Retropharyngeal abscess (RPA) is an abscess located in the tissues in the back of the throat behind the posterior pharyngeal wall (the retropharyngeal space).  Because RPAs typically occur in deep tissue, they are difficult to diagnose by physical examination alone. RPA is a relatively uncommon illness, and therefore may not receive early diagnosis in children presenting with stiff neck, malaise, difficulty swallowing, or other symptoms listed below. Early diagnosis is key, while a delay in diagnosis and treatment may lead to death. Parapharyngeal space communicates with retropharyngeal space and an infection of retropharyngeal space can pass down behind the esophagus into the mediastinum."
Pelvic Peritonitis,"Patients present with high fever and chills, with body temperature reaching 40°C or above, accompanied by severe cramp-like pain in the lower abdomen.","Peritonitis is inflammation of the localized or generalized peritoneum, the lining of the inner wall of the abdomen and covering of the abdominal organs. Symptoms may include severe pain, swelling of the abdomen, fever, or weight loss. One part or the entire abdomen may be tender. Complications may include shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Causes include perforation of the intestinal tract, pancreatitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, stomach ulcer, cirrhosis, a ruptured appendix or even a perforated gallbladder."
Septicemic Pneumonia,"Pulmonary infection, shock, cough, sputum production, pale complexion, cold sweats, general malaise, decreased blood pressure, cold extremities, rapid thin pulse, cyanosis of the lips, cyanosis","Pneumonic plague is a severe lung infection caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. Symptoms include fever, headache, shortness of breath, chest pain, and coughing. They typically start about three to seven days after exposure. It is one of three forms of plague, the other two being septicemic plague and bubonic plague.
The pneumonic form may occur following an initial bubonic or septicemic plague infection."
Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM),"Often asymptomatic, but may present with severe headache, vomiting, loss of consciousness, seizures, and limb paralysis upon rupture of the abnormal vessels.","A cerebral arteriovenous malformation (cerebral AVM, CAVM, cAVM, brain AVM, or BAVM) is an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in the brainspecifically, an arteriovenous malformation in the cerebrum.


== Signs and symptoms ==
The most frequently observed problems related to a cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) are headaches and seizures, cranial nerve afflictions including pinched nerve and palsy, backaches, neckaches, and nausea from coagulated blood that has made its way down to be dissolved in the cerebrospinal fluid. Perhaps 15% of the population at detection are asymptomatic. Other common symptoms are a pulsing noise in the head, progressive weakness, numbness and vision changes as well as debilitating, excruciating pain.
In serious cases, blood vessels rupture and cause bleeding within the brain (intracranial hemorrhage)."
Pediatric Sudden Cardiac Arrest and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation,"Cardiac arrest, Respiratory distress","Cardiac arrest (also known as sudden cardiac arrest [SCA]) is when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating. When the heart stops beating, blood cannot properly circulate around the body and the blood flow to the brain and other organs is decreased. When the brain does not receive enough blood, this can cause a person to lose consciousness and brain cells can start to die due to lack of oxygen. Coma and persistent vegetative state may result from cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest is also identified by a lack of central pulses and abnormal or absent breathing."
Cholangitis,"Upper abdominal pain, high fever, jaundice","Ascending cholangitis, also known as acute cholangitis or simply cholangitis, is inflammation of the bile duct, usually caused by bacteria ascending from its junction with the duodenum (first part of the small intestine). It tends to occur if the bile duct is already partially obstructed by gallstones.
Cholangitis can be life-threatening, and is regarded as a medical emergency. Characteristic symptoms include yellow discoloration of the skin or whites of the eyes, fever, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, low blood pressure and confusion. Initial treatment is with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but there is often an underlying problem (such as gallstones or narrowing in the bile duct) for which further tests and treatments may be necessary, usually in the form of endoscopy to relieve obstruction of the bile duct."
Electrical Burn,"Wounds are grayish-yellow, charred yellow, dry, and painful","An electrical burn is a burn that results from electricity passing through the body causing rapid injury. Approximately 1000 deaths per year due to electrical injuries are reported in the United States, with a mortality rate of 3-5%. Electrical burns differ from thermal or chemical burns in that they cause much more subdermal damage. They can exclusively cause surface damage, but more often tissues deeper underneath the skin have been severely damaged. As a result, electrical burns are difficult to accurately diagnose, and many people underestimate the severity of their burn."
Enterocutaneous Fistula,"Fever, abdominal distention, abdominal pain, malnutrition, abdominal discomfort, intra-abdominal infection, septic fever, abdominal tenderness, mixed acid-base imbalance, gastrointestinal bleeding, paralytic ileus, widespread and non-localized abdominal pain","An enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) is an abnormal communication between the small or large bowel and the skin that allows the contents of the stomach or intestines to leak through an opening in the skin.

Moderate-output fistula: 200500 mL/day
High-output fistula: > 500 mL/day


== Treatment ==
The majority will close spontaneously within approximately 6 weeks. If it has not closed by 12 weeks, it is unlikely to do so and definitive surgery should be planned. The median time to definitive repair from fistula onset was 6 months (range 1 day to 28 months). The 6-month time course is commonly utilized by groups with significant experience treating fistulas, owing to the trend in encountering a less hostile abdomen than in the early phases."
Renal Oncocytoma,"Hematuria, flank pain, mass","A renal oncocytoma is a tumour of the kidney made up of oncocytes, epithelial cells with an excess amount of mitochondria.


== Signs and symptoms ==

Renal oncocytomas are often asymptomatic and are frequently discovered by chance on a CT or ultrasound of the abdomen. Possible signs and symptoms of a renal oncocytoma include blood in the urine, flank pain, and an abdominal mass.


== Pathophysiology ==
Renal oncocytoma is thought to arise from the intercalated cells of collecting ducts of the kidney. It represent 5% to 15% of surgically resected renal neoplasms."
Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) in the Elderly,"Accompanied by mental disorders, tremor paralysis, and incontinence of urine and feces","Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), also called malresorptive hydrocephalus, is a form of communicating hydrocephalus in which excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) builds up in the ventricles, leading to normal or slightly elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure. The fluid build-up causes the ventricles to enlarge and the pressure inside the head to increase, compressing surrounding brain tissue and leading to neurological complications. Although the cause of idiopathic (also referred to as primary) NPH remains unclear, it has been associated with various co-morbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, and hyperlipidemia. Causes of secondary NPH include trauma, hemorrhage, or infection. The disease presents in a classic triad of symptoms, which are memory impairment, urinary frequency, and balance problems/gait deviations (note: this diagnosis method is obsolete)."
Pediatric Medulloblastoma,"Unsteady gait, diplopia, ataxia, neck stiffness, increased intracranial pressure, edema, headache, difficulty swallowing","Medulloblastoma is a common type of primary brain cancer in children. It originates in the part of the brain that is towards the back and the bottom, on the floor of the skull, in the cerebellum, or posterior fossa.
The brain is divided into two main parts, the larger cerebrum on top and the smaller cerebellum below towards the back. They are separated by a membrane called the tentorium. Tumors that originate in the cerebellum or the surrounding region below the tentorium are, therefore, called infratentorial."
Mesenteric Tumor,"Cachexia, rectal bleeding, abdominal mass, fibrosis of intestinal wall, abdominal pain, fever, loss of appetite, hydronephrosis, lumbar soreness, frequent urination, chest tightness","Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome is a gastro-vascular disorder in which the third and final portion of the duodenum is compressed between the abdominal aorta (AA) and the overlying superior mesenteric artery.  This rare, potentially life-threatening syndrome is typically caused by an angle of 625 between the AA and the SMA, in comparison to the normal range of 3856, due to a lack of retroperitoneal and visceral fat (mesenteric fat). In addition, the aortomesenteric distance is 28 millimeters, as opposed to the typical 1020. However, a narrow SMA angle alone is not enough to make a diagnosis, because patients with a low BMI, most notably children, have been known to have a narrow SMA angle with no symptoms of SMA syndrome.
SMA syndrome is also known as Wilkie's syndrome, cast syndrome, mesenteric root syndrome, chronic duodenal ileus and intermittent arterio-mesenteric occlusion."
Tuberculous Ulcer,"Ulceration, Pain","Tuberculosis (TB), also known colloquially as the ""white death"", or historically as consumption, is a contagious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteria. Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections show no symptoms, in which case it is known as inactive or latent tuberculosis. A small proportion of latent infections progress to active disease that, if left untreated, can be fatal. Typical symptoms of active TB are chronic cough with blood-containing mucus, fever, night sweats, and weight loss."
HIV-associated nephropathy,"Unexplained fever, joint pain, lymphadenopathy, erythematous rash, hematuria, proteinuria, chronic renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, immunodeficiency, acute renal failure","HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) refers to kidney disease developing in association with infection by human immunodeficiency virus, the virus that causes AIDS. The most common, or ""classical"", type of HIV-associated nephropathy is a collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), though other forms of kidney disease may also occur. Regardless of the underlying histology, kidney disease in HIV-positive patients is associated with an increased risk of death.


== Cause ==
HIVAN may be caused by direct infection of the kidney cells by HIV, with resulting kidney damage through the viral gene products. It could also be caused by the release of cytokines during HIV infection. Usually occurs only in advanced HIV disease and approximately 80% of patients with HIVAN have a CD4 count of less than 200."
Chronic Respiratory Failure,"respiratory functional failure, cyanosis, dyspnea, arrhythmia, edema, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, agitation, coma, convulsions","Respiratory failure results from inadequate gas exchange by the respiratory system, meaning that the arterial oxygen, carbon dioxide, or both cannot be kept at normal levels. A drop in the oxygen carried in the blood is known as hypoxemia; a rise in arterial carbon dioxide levels is called hypercapnia. Respiratory failure is classified as either Type 1 or Type 2, based on whether there is a high carbon dioxide level, and can be acute or chronic. In clinical trials, the definition of respiratory failure usually includes increased respiratory rate, abnormal blood gases (hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or both), and evidence of increased work of breathing. Respiratory failure causes an altered state of consciousness due to ischemia in the brain."
Focal Nodular Hyperplasia of the Liver,"Abdominal mass, hepatomegaly, tenderness, right upper quadrant pain, abdominal lump","Focal nodular hyperplasia is a benign tumor of the liver (hepatic tumor), which is the second most prevalent tumor of the liver after hepatic hemangioma. It is usually asymptomatic, rarely grows or bleeds, and has no malignant potential. This tumor was once often resected because it was difficult to distinguish from hepatic adenoma, but with modern multiphase imaging it is usually now diagnosed by strict imaging criteria and not resected.


== Presentation ==

Focal nodular hyperplasia's most recognizable gross feature is a central stellate scar seen in 6070% of cases.  Microscopically, a lobular proliferation of bland-appearing hepatocytes with a bile ductular proliferation and malformed vessels within the fibrous scar is the most common pattern."
Meningococcemia,"Petechiae, ecchymoses, systemic rose-colored maculopapular rash, herpetic lesions, pustules, subcutaneous hemorrhage, chills, high fever, headache, vomiting, coma, convulsions","Meningococcal disease is a serious infection caused by Neisseria meningitidis, also known  as meningococcus, a gram negative diplococcus. Meningococcal disease includes meningitis,  meningococcal septicemia, or a combination of both, which can be life-threatening and rapidly progressive. If left untreated, the disease has a high mortality rate; however, it is preventable through vaccination. Meningitis and meningococcal sepsis are major causes of illness, death, and disability in both developed and under-developed countries.
Meningococcal disease can be transmitted to others through saliva, close contact with an infected individual by inhaling respiratory air droplets."
Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis,"Jaundice, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, continuous fever, pruritus, hepatosplenomegaly","Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a long-term progressive disease of the liver and gallbladder characterized by inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts, which normally allow bile to drain from the gallbladder. Affected individuals may have no symptoms or may experience signs and symptoms of liver disease, such as jaundice, itching, and abdominal pain.
The bile duct scarring that occurs in PSC narrows the ducts of the biliary tree and impedes the flow of bile to the duodenum. Eventually, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver failure. PSC increases the risk of various cancers, including liver cancer, gallbladder carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and cholangiocarcinoma."
Cancer Pain,"Pain, nausea, vomiting, cachexia","Pain in cancer may arise from a tumor compressing or infiltrating nearby body parts; from treatments and diagnostic procedures; or from skin, nerve and other changes caused by a hormone imbalance or immune response. Most chronic (long-lasting) pain is caused by the illness and most acute (short-term) pain is caused by treatment or diagnostic procedures. However, radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy may produce painful conditions that persist long after treatment has ended.
The presence of pain depends mainly on the location of the cancer and the stage of the disease. At any given time, about half of all people diagnosed with malignant cancer are experiencing pain, and two-thirds of those with advanced cancer experience pain of such intensity that it adversely affects their sleep, mood, social relations and activities of daily living."
Hypoglycemia,"Palpitations, cold sweats, pale complexion, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, visual disturbances, stiffness, coma, seizures, weakness, vertigo, hunger sensation","Hypoglycemia (American English), also spelled hypoglycaemia or hypoglycmia (British English), sometimes called low blood sugar, is a fall in blood sugar to levels below normal, typically below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). Whipple's triad is used to properly identify hypoglycemic episodes. It is defined as blood glucose below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), symptoms associated with hypoglycemia, and resolution of symptoms when blood sugar returns to normal. Hypoglycemia may result in headache, tiredness, clumsiness, trouble talking, confusion, fast heart rate, sweating, shakiness, nervousness, hunger, loss of consciousness, seizures, or death. Symptoms typically come on quickly."
Primary Juvenile Glaucoma,"Intraocular pus accumulation leading to blindness, sudden and rapid increase in intraocular pressure, abnormal pigmentation, narrowing of visual field, sunset syndrome, juvenile cataract, unequal pupil sizes, headache, sectoral iris atrophy, increased ocular pressure, eye fatigue, blue field entoptic phenomenon","Primary congenital glaucoma is a rare eye condition that is present at birth or develops early in childhood. It occurs due to improper drainage of the eye's fluids, which leads to increased pressure inside the eye, known as intraocular pressure. This elevated pressure can damage the optic nerve which will result in permanent vision loss.  It is also known as pediatric glaucoma or childhood glaucoma, and was previously known as trabeculodysgenesis or goniodysgenesis.


== Types ==
Primary congenital glaucoma is classified into three subtypes:

true congenital glaucoma, which causes signs of increased intraocular pressure within the first month of life,
infantile glaucoma, which presents between one month and three years, and
juvenile glaucoma, which becomes clinically apparent after three years of age and before age 40."
Myopia,"Decreased far vision, normal near vision, and visual fatigue","Myopia, also known as near-sightedness and short-sightedness, is an eye condition where light from distant objects focuses in front of, instead of on, the retina. As a result, distant objects appear blurry, while close objects appear normal. Other symptoms may include headaches and eye strain. Severe myopia is associated with an increased risk of macular degeneration, retinal detachment, cataracts, and glaucoma.
Myopia results from the length of the eyeball growing too long or less commonly the lens being too strong."
Pediatric Neurocutaneous Syndrome,"Facial angiofibromas, epileptic seizures, intellectual disability","SturgeWeber syndrome, sometimes referred to as encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis, is a rare congenital neurocutaneous disorder (also known as phakomatoses). It is often associated with port-wine stains of the face, glaucoma, seizures, intellectual disability, and ipsilateral leptomeningeal angioma (cerebral malformations and tumors). SturgeWeber syndrome can be classified into three different types. Type 1 includes facial and leptomeningeal angiomas as well as the possibility of glaucoma or choroidal lesions. Normally, only one side of the brain is affected."
Flaccid Paralysis,"Laxity of sinews and channels, weakness of limb muscles, inability to move at will, and even muscle atrophy or paralysis","Flaccid paralysis is a neurological condition characterized by weakness or paralysis and reduced muscle tone without other obvious cause (e.g., trauma). This abnormal condition may be caused by disease or by trauma affecting the nerves associated with the involved muscles.  For example, if the somatic nerves to a skeletal muscle are severed, then the muscle will exhibit flaccid paralysis.  When muscles enter this state, they become limp and cannot contract.  This condition can become fatal if it affects the respiratory muscles, posing the threat of suffocation."
Leukemia,"Fever, progressive anemia, significant bleeding tendency, bone and joint pain, nosebleed, gum bleeding","Leukemia (also spelled leukaemia; pronounced  loo-KEE-mee-) is a group of blood cancers that usually begin in the bone marrow and produce high numbers of abnormal blood cells. These blood cells are not fully developed and are called blasts or leukemia cells. Symptoms may include bleeding and bruising, bone pain, fatigue, fever, and an increased risk of infections. These symptoms occur due to a lack of normal blood cells. Diagnosis is typically made by blood tests or bone marrow biopsy."
Extremity Vascular Injury,"Bleeding, shock, limb pain, hematoma formation, severe pain, paralysis","A gunshot wound (GSW) is a penetrating injury caused by a projectile (e.g. a bullet) shot from a gun (typically a firearm). Damage may include bleeding, bone fractures, organ damage, wound infection, and loss of the ability to move part of the body. Damage depends on the part of the body hit, the path the bullet follows through (or into) the body, and the type and speed of the bullet. In severe cases, although not uncommon, the injury is fatal."
Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type II in Children,"Diarrhea, peptic ulcers, hot flashes, genital erythema, perianal erythema","Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (also known as ""Pheochromocytoma (codons 630 and 634) and amyloid producing medullary thyroid carcinoma"", ""PTC syndrome,"" and ""Sipple syndrome"") is a group of medical disorders associated with tumors of the endocrine system. The tumors may be benign or malignant (cancer).  They generally occur in endocrine organs (e.g. thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenals), but may also occur in endocrine tissues of organs not classically thought of as endocrine. MEN2 is a sub-type of MEN (multiple endocrine neoplasia) and itself has sub-types, as discussed below."
Anomalous Termination of Coronary Artery,"Chest pain, headache, fever, abnormal heart sounds, heart murmurs, palpitations, syncope, vertigo, abnormal breathing, arrhythmia, pericardial effusion, shock","Coronary artery anomalies are variations of the coronary circulation, affecting <1% of the general population. Symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath and syncope, although cardiac arrest may be the first clinical presentation. Several varieties are identified, with a different potential to cause sudden cardiac death.


== Physiology of coronary arteries ==
Coronary arteries are vessels supplying blood and nutrients to the heart muscle (myocardium).
Coronary arteries arise from ostia, openings of the aorta (the largest artery in the human body) at the upper third or middle third of the sinuses of Valsalva (the first part of the big pipe coming off the main pumping chamber)."
Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type II,"Peptic ulcers, diarrhea, skin flushing","Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (also known as ""Pheochromocytoma (codons 630 and 634) and amyloid producing medullary thyroid carcinoma"", ""PTC syndrome,"" and ""Sipple syndrome"") is a group of medical disorders associated with tumors of the endocrine system. The tumors may be benign or malignant (cancer).  They generally occur in endocrine organs (e.g. thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenals), but may also occur in endocrine tissues of organs not classically thought of as endocrine. MEN2 is a sub-type of MEN (multiple endocrine neoplasia) and itself has sub-types, as discussed below."
Lung Adenocarcinoma,"Cough, expectoration, hemoptysis, weight loss, dyspnea, chest pain","Adenocarcinoma of the lung is the most common type of lung cancer, and like other forms of lung cancer, it is characterized by distinct cellular and molecular features. It is classified as one of several non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), to distinguish it from small cell lung cancer which has a different behavior and prognosis. Lung adenocarcinoma is further classified into several subtypes and variants. The signs and symptoms of this specific type of lung cancer are similar to other forms of lung cancer, and patients most commonly complain of persistent cough and shortness of breath.
Adenocarcinoma is more common in patients with a history of cigarette smoking, and is the most common form of lung cancer in younger women and Asian populations."
Malignant Melanoma,"Skin moles, pigmented skin lesions","Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer; it develops from the  melanin-producing cells known as melanocytes. It typically occurs in the skin, but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye (uveal melanoma). In very rare cases melanoma can also happen in the lung which is known as primary pulmonary melanoma and only happens in 0.01% of primary lung tumors.
In women, melanomas most commonly occur on the legs; while in men, on the back. Melanoma is frequently referred to as malignant melanoma."
Persistent Tubal Pregnancy,"Amenorrhea, abdominal pain, irregular vaginal bleeding, shock","Ectopic pregnancy is a complication of pregnancy in which the embryo attaches outside the uterus. Signs and symptoms classically include abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding, but fewer than 50 percent of affected women have both of these symptoms. The pain may be described as sharp, dull, or crampy. Pain may also spread to the shoulder if bleeding into the abdomen has occurred. Severe bleeding may result in a fast heart rate, fainting, or shock."
Acute Lymphangitis,"Skin redness, tenderness, limb coldness, fever, localized infection, fatigue, loss of appetite","Lymphangitis is an inflammation or an infection of the lymphatic channels that occurs as a result of infection at a site distal to the channel. It may present as long red streaks spreading away from the site of infection. It is a possible medical emergency as involvement of the lymphatic system allows for an infection to spread rapidly. The most common cause of lymphangitis in humans is bacteria, in which case sepsis and death could result within hours if left untreated. The most commonly involved bacteria include Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A strep) and hemolytic streptococci."
Giant Cell Tumor of Bone,"Pain, localized swelling, lump, and joint dysfunction","Giant-cell tumor of the bone (GCTOB) is a relatively uncommon bone tumor characterized by the presence of multinucleated giant cells (osteoclast-like cells). Malignancy in giant-cell tumor is uncommon and occurs in about 2% of all cases. However, if malignant degeneration does occur, it is likely to metastasize to the lungs. Giant-cell tumors are normally benign, with unpredictable behavior. 
It is a heterogeneous tumor composed of different cell populations."
Periosteal Chondrosarcoma,"Bone pain, spontaneous fractures, bone necrosis","Chondrosarcoma is a bone sarcoma, a primary cancer composed of cells derived from transformed cells that produce cartilage. A chondrosarcoma is a member of a category of tumors of bone and soft tissue known as sarcomas.  About 30% of bone sarcomas are chondrosarcomas. It is resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Unlike other primary bone sarcomas that mainly affect children and adolescents, a chondrosarcoma can present at any age."
Epidemic Typhus,"Fever, maculopapular rash, headache, delirium, arrhythmias, coma, cough, nausea and vomiting, chest pain, persistent high fever, fatigue, dizziness","Epidemic typhus, also known as louse-borne typhus, is a form of typhus so named because the disease often causes epidemics following wars and natural disasters where civil life is disrupted. Epidemic typhus is spread to people through contact with infected body lice, in contrast to endemic typhus which is usually transmitted by fleas.
Though typhus has been responsible for millions of deaths throughout history, it is still considered a rare disease that occurs mainly in populations that suffer unhygienic extreme overcrowding. Typhus is most rare in industrialized countries. It occurs primarily in the colder, mountainous regions of central and east Africa, as well as Central and South America."
Primary Peritonitis,"Fever, abdominal pain, peritonitis, ascites, abdominal distension, muscular rigidity of the abdomen, sudden onset of colic, pain in the left and right flank, acute abdominal pain","Peritonitis is inflammation of the localized or generalized peritoneum, the lining of the inner wall of the abdomen and covering of the abdominal organs. Symptoms may include severe pain, swelling of the abdomen, fever, or weight loss. One part or the entire abdomen may be tender. Complications may include shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Causes include perforation of the intestinal tract, pancreatitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, stomach ulcer, cirrhosis, a ruptured appendix or even a perforated gallbladder."
Amebiasis,"Fever of unknown origin, abdominal distention, hepatomegaly, progressive cachexia, tenesmus, dysentery, brain abscess, anemia","Amoebiasis, or amoebic dysentery, is an infection of the intestines caused by a parasitic amoeba Entamoeba histolytica. Amoebiasis can be present with no, mild, or severe symptoms. Symptoms may include lethargy, loss of weight, colonic ulcerations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or bloody diarrhea. Complications can include inflammation and ulceration of the colon with tissue death or perforation, which may result in peritonitis. Anemia may develop due to prolonged gastric bleeding."
Paraneoplastic Syndromes,"Chest pain, joint pain, acral enlargement","A paraneoplastic syndrome is a syndrome (a set of signs and symptoms) that is the consequence of a tumor in the body (usually a cancerous one). It is specifically due to the production of chemical signaling molecules (such as hormones or cytokines) by tumor cells or by an immune response against the tumor. Unlike a mass effect, it is not due to the local presence of cancer cells.
Paraneoplastic syndromes are typical among middle-aged to older people, and they most commonly occur with cancers of the lung, breast, ovaries or lymphatic system (a lymphoma). Sometimes, the symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes show before the diagnosis of a malignancy, which has been hypothesized to relate to the disease pathogenesis."
Subacute Infective Endocarditis,"Low-grade fever, clubbing, arrhythmias, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, fatigue, night sweats, relapsing fever, intermittent fever, fever of unknown origin, persistent fever, chills","Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner surface of the heart (endocardium), usually the valves. Signs and symptoms may include fever, small areas of bleeding into the skin, heart murmur, feeling tired, and low red blood cell count. Complications may include backward blood flow in the heart, heart failure  the heart struggling to pump a sufficient amount of blood to meet the body's needs, abnormal electrical conduction in the heart, stroke, and kidney failure.
The cause is typically a bacterial infection and less commonly a fungal infection. Risk factors include valvular heart disease, including rheumatic disease, congenital heart disease, artificial valves, hemodialysis, intravenous drug use, and electronic pacemakers."
Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA),"Monoplegia, hemiplegia, sensory disturbances, visual impairments, vertigo, motor aphasia, dysphagia, hoarseness, decreased hearing, limb weakness, memory loss, consciousness disorders","A transient ischemic attack (TIA), commonly known as a mini-stroke, is a temporary (transient) stroke with noticeable symptoms that end within 24 hours. A TIA causes the same symptoms associated with a stroke, such as weakness or numbness on one side of the body, sudden dimming or loss of vision, difficulty speaking or understanding language or slurred speech.
All forms of stroke, including a TIA, result from a disruption in blood flow to the central nervous system.  A TIA is caused by a temporary disruption in blood flow to the brain, or cerebral blood flow (CBF).  The primary difference between a major stroke and the TIA's minor stroke is how much tissue death (infarction) can be detected afterwards through medical imaging."
Optic Neuropathy,"Sudden decline in vision, flashing lights, orbital pain, especially when the eye moves","Optic neuropathy is damage to the optic nerve from any cause. The optic nerve is a bundle of millions of fibers in the retina that sends visual signals to the brain.
Damage and death of these nerve cells, or neurons, leads to characteristic features of optic neuropathy. The main symptom is loss of vision, with colors appearing subtly washed out in the affected eye. A pale disc is characteristic of long-standing optic neuropathy."
Perinatal Care,Normal pregnant women can undergo perinatal care from the beginning of pregnancy until before delivery.,"Prenatal care, also known as antenatal care, is a type of preventive healthcare for pregnant individuals. It is provided in the form of medical checkups and healthy lifestyle recommendations for the pregnant person. Antenatal care also consists of educating the pregnant individual about maternal physiological and biological changes in pregnancy, along with prenatal nutrition; all of which prevent potential health problems throughout the pregnancy and promote good health for the parent and the fetus. The availability of routine prenatal care, including prenatal screening and diagnosis, has played a part in reducing the frequency of maternal death, miscarriages, birth defects, low birth weight, neonatal infections, and other preventable health problems.


== Prenatal Visits ==
Traditional prenatal care in high-income countries generally consists of:

monthly visits during the first two trimesters (from the 1st week to the 28th week)
fortnightly visits from the 28th week to the 36th week of pregnancy
weekly visits after 36th week to the delivery, from the 38th week to the 42nd week
Assessment of parental needs and family dynamics
The WHO recommends that pregnant women should all receive at least eight antenatal visits to spot and treat problems and give immunizations."
Melanoma,"Dark moles, swollen lymph nodes, black vaginal discharge","Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer; it develops from the  melanin-producing cells known as melanocytes. It typically occurs in the skin, but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye (uveal melanoma). In very rare cases melanoma can also happen in the lung which is known as primary pulmonary melanoma and only happens in 0.01% of primary lung tumors.
In women, melanomas most commonly occur on the legs; while in men, on the back. Melanoma is frequently referred to as malignant melanoma."
Geriatric Watershed Cerebral Infarction,"Hypotension, hemiplegia, sensory disturbance, quadrantanopia, cerebral dysfunction, ataxia, central fever, delirium, basal ganglia hemorrhage, paralysis, hemianopia","Stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to a part of the brain causes cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. Both cause parts of the brain to stop functioning properly.
Signs and symptoms of stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, dizziness, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred."
Pediatric Intracranial Hemorrhage,"Sensory disturbances, high fever, coma, convulsions, severe headache, intracranial hypertension, pallor, signs of meningeal irritation","Pediatric stroke is a stroke that occurs in children or adolescents.  Stroke affects an estimated 2.5 to 13 per 100,000 children annually.
The signs and symptoms of stroke in children, infants, and newborns are different from those in adults. The causes and risk factors of stroke in children are also different from those in adults. Children have hemorrhagic strokes at the same rate in which they have ischemic strokes, while adults are more likely to have ischemic strokes."
Pituitary Adenoma in the Elderly,"Excess endocrine hormones, partial or complete pituitary insufficiency, compression of adjacent tissues by pituitary adenoma","Pituitary adenomas are tumors that occur in the pituitary gland. Most pituitary tumors are benign, approximately 35% are invasive and just 0.1% to 0.2% are carcinomas. Pituitary adenomas represent from 10% to 25% of all intracranial neoplasms, with an estimated prevalence rate in the general population of approximately 17%.
Non-invasive and non-secreting pituitary adenomas are considered to be benign in the literal as well as the clinical sense, though a 2011 meta-analysis of available research showed that research to either support or refute this assumption was scant and of questionable quality.
Adenomas exceeding 10 mm (0.39 in) in size are defined as macroadenomas, while those smaller than 10 mm (0.39 in) are referred to as microadenomas."
Gardner's Syndrome,"Diarrhea, rectal bleeding, colon polyps, subcutaneous cysts, bone pain, bone cysts","Gardner's syndrome (also known as Gardner syndrome, familial polyposis of the colon, or familial colorectal polyposis) is a subtype of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Gardner syndrome is an autosomal dominant form of polyposis characterized by the presence of multiple polyps in the colon together with tumors outside the colon. The extracolonic tumors may include osteomas of the skull, thyroid cancer, epidermoid cysts, fibromas, as well as the occurrence of desmoid tumors in approximately 15% of affected individuals.
Desmoid tumors are fibrous tumors that usually occur in the tissue covering the intestines and may be provoked by surgery to remove the colon. The countless polyps in the colon predispose to the development of colon cancer; if the colon is not removed, the chance of colon cancer is considered to be very significant."
Neurogenic Bladder,"Significant decrease or loss of bladder sensation (urge to urinate, bladder distension)","Neurogenic bladder dysfunction, often called by the shortened term neurogenic bladder, refers to urinary bladder problems due to disease or injury of the central nervous system or peripheral nerves involved in the control of urination. There are multiple types of neurogenic bladder depending on the underlying cause and the symptoms. Symptoms include overactive bladder, urinary urgency, frequency, incontinence or difficulty passing urine. A range of diseases or conditions can cause neurogenic bladder including spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, stroke, brain injury, spina bifida, peripheral nerve damage, Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy or other neurodegenerative diseases. Neurogenic bladder can be diagnosed through a history and physical as well as imaging and more specialized testing."
Testicular Cancer,"The presence of a painless lump in the testicle, a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum, enlargement of a testicle, and a sudden increase in fluid in the scrotum.","Testicular cancer is cancer that develops in the testicles, a part of the male reproductive system. Symptoms may include a lump in the testicle or swelling or pain in the scrotum. Treatment may result in infertility.
Risk factors include an undescended testis, family history of the disease, and previous history of testicular cancer. More than 95% are germ cell tumors which are divided into seminomas and non-seminomas."
Ovarian Sertoli-Leydig Cell Tumor,"Pelvic mass, irregular vaginal bleeding, postmenopausal bleeding, virilization, scanty menstruation, clitoromegaly, abdominal distension","SertoliLeydig cell tumour is a group of tumors composed of variable proportions of Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, and in the case of intermediate and poorly differentiated neoplasms, primitive gonadal stroma and sometimes heterologous elements. The tumor secretes testosterone. It is a member of the sex cord-stromal tumour group of ovarians and testicular tumors.
The tumour mainly occurs in early adulthood (not seen in newborn), is rare, comprising less than 1% of testicular tumours. While the tumour can occur at any age, it occurs most often in young adults."
Myopia,"Decreased far vision, normal near vision, and visual fatigue","Myopia, also known as near-sightedness and short-sightedness, is an eye condition where light from distant objects focuses in front of, instead of on, the retina. As a result, distant objects appear blurry, while close objects appear normal. Other symptoms may include headaches and eye strain. Severe myopia is associated with an increased risk of macular degeneration, retinal detachment, cataracts, and glaucoma.
Myopia results from the length of the eyeball growing too long or less commonly the lens being too strong."
Multi-infarct Dementia,"Central facial and lingual paralysis, hemiplegia, unilateral sensory disturbance, increased muscle tone, pyramidal signs, pseudobulbar palsy, hyperesthesia, urinary and fecal incontinence, reduced short-term memory and calculation abilities, apathetic facial expression, anxiety, mutism, depression or euphoria.","Vascular dementia is dementia caused by a series of strokes. Restricted blood flow due to strokes reduces oxygen and glucose delivery to the brain, causing cell injury and neurological deficits in the affected region. Subtypes of vascular dementia include subcortical vascular dementia, multi-infarct dementia, stroke-related dementia, and mixed dementia.
Subcortical vascular dementia occurs from damage to small blood vessels in the brain. Multi-infarct dementia results from a series of small strokes affecting several brain regions."
Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies,"Maculopapular rash, macular rash, morning stiffness, congestion, conduction block, proteinuria, low fever, fatigue","Inflammatory myopathy, also known as idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM), is disease featuring muscle weakness, inflammation of muscles (myositis), and in some types, muscle pain (myalgia). The cause of much inflammatory myopathy is unknown (idiopathic), and such cases are classified according to their symptoms and signs, electromyography, MRI, and laboratory findings. It can also be associated with underlying cancer. The main classes of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy are polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM) (including juvenile, amyopathic, and sine-dermatitis form), inclusion-body myositis (IBM), immune-mediated necrotising myopathy (IMNM), and focal autoimmune myositis.


== Diagnosis ==
Idiopathic inflammatory myopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion."
Methanol Poisoning,"Headache, eye pain, dizziness, fatigue, confusion, insomnia, delirium, blurred consciousness, diplopia, retinal hemorrhage, optic disc pallor, optic atrophy","Methanol toxicity (also methanol poisoning) is poisoning from methanol, characteristically via ingestion. Symptoms may include an altered/decreased level of consciousness, poor or no coordination, vomiting, abdominal pain, and a specific smell on the breath. Decreased vision may start as early as twelve hours after exposure. Long-term outcomes may include blindness and kidney failure. Blindness may occur after drinking as little as 10 mL; death may occur after drinking quantities over 15 mL (median 100 mL, varies depending on body weight)."
Endometrial Hyperplasia,"Menstrual disorder, heavy menstruation, scanty menstruation, irregular vaginal bleeding, amenorrhea","Endometrial hyperplasia is a condition of excessive proliferation of the cells of the endometrium, or inner lining of the uterus.
Most cases of endometrial hyperplasia result from high levels of estrogens, combined with insufficient levels of the progesterone-like hormones which ordinarily counteract estrogen's proliferative effects on this tissue. This may occur in several settings, including obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome, estrogen producing tumours (e.g. granulosa cell tumour) and certain formulations of estrogen replacement therapy.
Endometrial hyperplasia with atypia is a significant risk factor for the development or even co-existence of endometrial cancer, so careful monitoring and treatment of women with this disorder is essential."
Phlegm Syncope,"Syncope, rapid breathing, rhonchi, limbs coldness","A cough is a sudden expulsion of air through the large breathing passages which can help clear them of fluids, irritants, foreign particles and microbes. As a protective reflex, coughing can be repetitive with the cough reflex following three phases: an inhalation, a forced exhalation against a closed glottis, and a violent release of air from the lungs following opening of the glottis, usually accompanied by a distinctive sound.
Frequent coughing usually indicates the presence of a disease. Many viruses and bacteria benefit, from an evolutionary perspective, by causing the host to cough, which helps to spread the disease to new hosts. Irregular coughing is usually caused by a respiratory tract infection but can also be triggered by choking, smoking, air pollution, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, post-nasal drip, chronic bronchitis, lung tumors, heart failure and medications such as angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and beta blockers."
Chronic Cervical Soft Tissue Injury,"Long-term bowing, history of poor cervical posture, neck pain, soreness and swelling, crackling sound during movement, symptoms worsen with cold or fatigue","A gunshot wound (GSW) is a penetrating injury caused by a projectile (e.g. a bullet) shot from a gun (typically a firearm). Damage may include bleeding, bone fractures, organ damage, wound infection, and loss of the ability to move part of the body. Damage depends on the part of the body hit, the path the bullet follows through (or into) the body, and the type and speed of the bullet. In severe cases, although not uncommon, the injury is fatal."
Menstrual Fever,Cyclical fever accompanying menstruation,"Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a condition caused by bacterial toxins. Symptoms may include fever, rash, skin peeling, and low blood pressure. There may also be symptoms related to the specific underlying infection such as mastitis, osteomyelitis, necrotising fasciitis, or pneumonia.
TSS is typically caused by bacteria of the Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus type, though others may also be involved. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is sometimes referred to as toxic-shock-like syndrome (TSLS)."
Melioidosis Pneumonia,"Fever, diarrhea, cough, expectoration, chest pain, interlobar fissures often present as arc-shaped droop, hemoptysis, pulmonary infection, nausea and vomiting, bronchoalveolar sounds, abdominal pain, purulent pulmonary infection","Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by a gram-negative bacterium called Burkholderia pseudomallei.  Most people exposed to B. pseudomallei experience no symptoms, but complications can range from fever and skin changes to pneumonia, abscesses, and septic shock, which can be fatal. Approximately 10% of people with melioidosis develop symptoms that last longer than two months, termed ""chronic melioidosis"".
Humans are infected with B. pseudomallei by contact with contaminated soil or water. The bacteria enter the body through wounds, inhalation, or ingestion."
Pharyngeal Tumor,"Difficulty swallowing, sensation of obstruction, feeling of pressure, sore throat with referred pain to the ear","Head and neck cancer is a general term encompassing multiple cancers that can develop in the head and neck region. These include cancers of the mouth, tongue, gums and lips (oral cancer), voice box (laryngeal), throat (nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal), salivary glands, nose and sinuses. 
Head and neck cancer can present a wide range of symptoms depending on where the cancer developed. These can include an ulcer in the mouth that does not heal, changes in the voice, difficulty swallowing, red or white patches in the mouth, and a neck lump. 
The majority of head and neck cancer is caused by the use of alcohol or tobacco (including smokeless tobacco)."
Pediatric Pneumococcal Meningitis,"Fever, headache, vomiting, intracranial hypertension, sepsis, meningitis, brain abscess, hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, mastoiditis, pediatric fever, coma","Pneumococcal infection is an infection caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. 
S. pneumoniae is a common member of the bacterial flora colonizing the nose and throat of 510% of healthy adults and 2040% of healthy children. However, it is also a cause of significant disease, being a leading cause of pneumonia, bacterial meningitis, and sepsis. The World Health Organization estimates that in 2005, pneumococcal infections were responsible for the death of 1.6 million children worldwide.


== Infections ==

Pneumococcal pneumonia represents 15%50% of all episodes of community-acquired pneumonia, 3050% of all cases of acute otitis media, and a significant proportion of bloodstream infections and bacterial meningitis."
Enterocutaneous Fistula,"Fever, abdominal distention, abdominal pain, malnutrition, abdominal discomfort, intra-abdominal infection, septic fever, abdominal tenderness, mixed acid-base imbalance, gastrointestinal bleeding, paralytic ileus, widespread and non-localized abdominal pain","An enterocutaneous fistula (ECF) is an abnormal communication between the small or large bowel and the skin that allows the contents of the stomach or intestines to leak through an opening in the skin.

== Diagnosis ==


=== Classification ===
Congenital types: tracheoesophageal, vitellointestinal duct, patent urachus, rectovaginal
Acquired: trauma (postoperative), radiation, malignancy, infection


=== Two categories ===
Low-output fistula: < 500 mL/day
High-output fistula: > 500 mL/day


=== Three categories ===
Low-output fistula: < 200 mL/day
Moderate-output fistula: 200500 mL/day
High-output fistula: > 500 mL/day


== Treatment ==
The majority will close spontaneously within approximately 6 weeks. If it has not closed by 12 weeks, it is unlikely to do so and definitive surgery should be planned. The median time to definitive repair from fistula onset was 6 months (range 1 day to 28 months). The 6-month time course is commonly utilized by groups with significant experience treating fistulas, owing to the trend in encountering a less hostile abdomen than in the early phases."
Reye's Syndrome,"Hypoglycemia, headache, coma, dehydration, syncope, nausea and vomiting, hepatomegaly, abnormal respiration, cerebral edema, irritability, somnolence, seizures","Reye syndrome is a rapidly worsening brain disease. Symptoms of Reye syndrome may include vomiting, personality changes, confusion, seizures, and loss of consciousness. While liver toxicity typically occurs in the syndrome, jaundice usually does not. Death occurs in 2040% of those affected with Reye syndrome, and about a third of those who survive are left with a significant degree of brain damage.
The cause of Reye syndrome is unknown."
Pediatric Cardiac-facial Syndrome,"Poor development of the depressor anguli oris muscle, facial deformities, unilateral facial hypertrophy","Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a condition affecting repolarization (relaxing) of the heart after a heartbeat, giving rise to an abnormally lengthy QT interval. It results in an increased risk of an irregular heartbeat which can result in fainting, drowning, seizures, or sudden death. These episodes can be triggered by exercise or stress. Some rare forms of LQTS are associated with other symptoms and signs including deafness and periods of muscle weakness.
Long QT syndrome may be present at birth or develop later in life."
Closed Head Injury,"Disturbance of consciousness, scalp injuries, bleeding or leakage from ears and nose, unequal pupil size, abnormal light reflex, abnormal motor and tendon reflexes","Closed-head injury is a type of traumatic brain injury in which the skull and dura mater remain intact. Closed-head injuries are the leading cause of death in children under 4 years old and the most common cause of physical disability and cognitive impairment in young people. Overall, closed-head injuries and other forms of mild traumatic brain injury account for about 75% of the estimated 1.7 million brain injuries that occur annually in the United States. Brain injuries such as closed-head injuries may result in lifelong physical, cognitive, or psychological impairment and, thus, are of utmost concern with regards to public health.


== Symptoms ==
If symptoms of a head injury are seen after an accident, medical care is necessary to diagnose and treat the injury."
Pediatric Neuroblastoma,"Periorbital ecchymosis, cough, abdominal pain, fever, abdominal mass, body pain, proptosis, emaciation, increased abdominal girth, anemia, shortness of breath","Neuroblastoma (NB) is a type of cancer that forms in certain types of nerve tissue. It most frequently starts from one of the adrenal glands but can also develop in the head, neck, chest, abdomen, or spine. Symptoms may include bone pain, a lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest, or a painless bluish lump under the skin.
Typically, neuroblastoma occurs due to a genetic mutation occurring in the first trimester of pregnancy. Rarely, it may be due to a mutation inherited."
Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma,"Nodule, painless salivary gland mass, severe pain, inability to move the eyeball voluntarily, periorbital edema, headache","Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a rare type of cancer that can exist in many different body sites. This tumor most often occurs in the salivary glands, but it can also be found in many anatomic sites, including the breast, lacrimal gland, lung, brain, Bartholin gland, trachea, and the paranasal sinuses.
It is the third-most common malignant salivary gland tumor overall (after mucoepidermoid carcinoma and polymorphous adenocarcinoma). It represents 28% of malignant submandibular gland tumors, making it the single most common malignant salivary gland tumor in this region.  Patients may survive for years with metastases because this tumor is generally well-differentiated and slow growing."
Stiff Neck,"Upon waking, there is a notable soreness and pain in the neck and upper back area, with limited neck mobility.","Neck stiffness, stiff neck and nuchal rigidity are terms often used interchangeably to describe the medical condition when one experiences discomfort or pain when trying to turn, move, or flex the neck. Possible causes include muscle strain or sprain, cervical spine disorder, meningitis, and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Nuchal rigidity due to irritation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord is one of the main symptoms of meningitis."
Hibernoma,"Slow enlargement in the scapular, chest, neck, or thigh areas, with occasional tenderness","A hibernoma is a benign neoplasm of vestigial brown fat. They were first described under the name pseudolipoma by the German physician H. Merkel in 1906 and the term hibernoma was proposed by the French anatomist Louis Gery in 1914 because of its resemblance to brown fat in hibernating animals. 


== Signs and symptoms ==
Patients present with a slow-growing, painless, solitary mass, usually of the subcutaneous tissues. It is much less frequently noted in the intramuscular tissue. It is not uncommon for symptoms to be present for years."
Neovascular Glaucoma,"Sectoral iris atrophy, elevated intraocular pressure, edema, narrowed visual field, eye pain, high intraocular pressure, eye fatigue, fundus hemorrhage, exudation","Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can lead to damage of the optic nerve. The optic nerve transmits visual information from the eye to the brain. Glaucoma may cause vision loss if left untreated. It has been called the ""silent thief of sight"" because the loss of vision usually occurs slowly over a long period of time. A major risk factor for glaucoma is increased pressure within the eye, known as intraocular pressure (IOP)."
Amebiasis,"Fever of unknown origin, abdominal distention, hepatomegaly, progressive cachexia, tenesmus, dysentery, brain abscess, anemia","Amoebiasis, or amoebic dysentery, is an infection of the intestines caused by a parasitic amoeba Entamoeba histolytica. Amoebiasis can be present with no, mild, or severe symptoms. Symptoms may include lethargy, loss of weight, colonic ulcerations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or bloody diarrhea. Complications can include inflammation and ulceration of the colon with tissue death or perforation, which may result in peritonitis. Anemia may develop due to prolonged gastric bleeding."
Pityriasis Lichenoides,"Chronic, asymptomatic, with erythematous scaly patches, circular or irregular shape, covered with scales of red, dark red patches","Pityriasis lichenoides represents a distinct subset of inflammatory skin disorders that includes pityriasis lichenoides chronica, febrile ulceronecrotic Mucha-Habermann disease, and pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA).
PLEVA typically manifests as an acute to subacute skin eruption of several tiny red papules that grow into polymorphic lesions. It may also leave behind varicella-like scars and hyper- or hypopigmentation sequelae.
Pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC) has very small reddish-brown flat maculopapules with a mica-like scale that appear more gradually; it also has long remission intervals between episodes of relapse.
Febrile ulceronecrotic Mucha-Habermann disease (FUMHD) is best treated as a dermatological emergency because it is an acute, severe, widespread eruption of purpuric and ulceronecrotic plaques that can have a 25% fatality rate and accompanying systemic involvement."
Refractory Heart Failure,"Shortness of breath, orthopnea, cyanosis, ascites, edema, heart failure, limb coldness, dyspnea, right upper quadrant pain","Heart failure (HF), also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), is a syndrome caused by an impairment in the heart's ability to fill with and pump blood.
Although symptoms vary based on which side of the heart is affected, HF typically presents with shortness of breath, excessive fatigue, and bilateral leg swelling. The severity of the heart failure is mainly decided based on ejection fraction and also measured by the severity of symptoms. Other conditions that have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver disease, anemia, and thyroid disease.
Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excessive alcohol consumption, infection, and cardiomyopathy."
Clonorchiasis,"Recurrent infections, abnormal appetite, anorexia, malnutrition, obstructive jaundice, biliary colic, impaired memory, insomnia, listlessness, epigastric hidden pain, fullness after meals, fatigue","Clonorchiasis is an infectious disease caused by the Chinese liver fluke (Clonorchis sinensis) and two related species.
Clonorchiasis is a known risk factor for the development of cholangiocarcinoma, a neoplasm of the biliary system.
Symptoms of opisthorchiasis caused by Opisthorchis viverrini and by O. felineus are indistinguishable from clonorchiasis caused by Clonorchis sinensis, leading some to argue that the disease by these three parasites should be referred to collectively as clonorchiasis.


== Signs and symptoms ==


== Cause ==
Clonorchis sinensis is a trematode (fluke) which is part of the phylum Platyhelminthes. The parasitic worm is as long as 10 to 25 mm and lives in the bile ducts of the liver."
Subcutaneous Panniculitis-like T-cell Lymphoma,"Fever, Nodules, Fatigue","T-cell lymphoma is a rare form of cancerous lymphoma affecting T-cells. Lymphoma arises mainly from the uncontrolled proliferation of lymphocytes, such as T-cells, and can become cancerous.
T-cell lymphoma is categorized under Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and represents less than 15% of all Non-Hodgkin's diseases in the category. T-cell lymphomas are often categorised based on their growth patterns as either aggressive (fast-growing) or indolent (slow-growing). Although the cause of T-cell lymphoma is not definitive, it has been associated with various risk factors and viruses such as EpsteinBarr virus (EBV) and human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV1)."
Colorectal Injury,"Gastrointestinal distension, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, disappearance of bowel sounds, peritonitis","Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as bowel cancer, colon cancer, or rectal cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine). Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, abdominal pain and fatigue. Most colorectal cancers are due to lifestyle factors and genetic disorders. Risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red meat, processed meat, and alcohol."
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML),"Pale complexion, fever, fatigue, accompanied by palpitations, shortness of breath, chest and rib pain, joint pain, skin presenting with sparse, dense petechiae, lymph node enlargement.","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal cells that build up in the bone marrow and blood and interfere with normal blood cell production. Symptoms may include feeling tired, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. Occasionally, spread may occur to the brain, skin, or gums. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly, and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.
Risk factors include getting older, being male, smoking, previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy, myelodysplastic syndrome, and exposure to the chemical benzene."
Zygomycosis,"Visual impairments, meningitis, encephalitis-like changes, cranial nerve damage, facial pain, paralysis","Zygomycosis is the broadest term to refer to infections caused by bread mold fungi of the zygomycota phylum. However, because zygomycota has been identified as polyphyletic, and is not included in modern fungal classification systems, the diseases that zygomycosis can refer to are better called by their specific names: mucormycosis (after Mucorales), phycomycosis (after Phycomycetes) and basidiobolomycosis (after Basidiobolus). These rare yet serious and potentially life-threatening fungal infections usually affect the face or oropharyngeal (nose and mouth) cavity. Zygomycosis type infections are most often caused by common fungi found in soil and decaying vegetation. While most individuals are exposed to the fungi on a regular basis, those with immune disorders (immunocompromised) are more prone to fungal infection."
Non-functioning Pituitary Adenoma,"Headaches, visual deficits, visual disturbances, vomiting, increased intracranial pressure, bitemporal hemianopsia, nerve atrophy, hydrocephalus, papilledema, epileptic-like seizures","Pituitary adenomas are tumors that occur in the pituitary gland. Most pituitary tumors are benign, approximately 35% are invasive and just 0.1% to 0.2% are carcinomas. Pituitary adenomas represent from 10% to 25% of all intracranial neoplasms, with an estimated prevalence rate in the general population of approximately 17%.
Non-invasive and non-secreting pituitary adenomas are considered to be benign in the literal as well as the clinical sense, though a 2011 meta-analysis of available research showed that research to either support or refute this assumption was scant and of questionable quality.
Adenomas exceeding 10 mm (0.39 in) in size are defined as macroadenomas, while those smaller than 10 mm (0.39 in) are referred to as microadenomas."
Streptococcal Toxic Shock Syndrome (STSS),"Fever, hypotension, severe pain, widespread skin erythema and swelling, heart failure, shock, syncope, increased urine specific gravity, faint heart sounds, signs of cardiac tamponade, elevated red blood cell hematocrit, decreased effective blood volume","Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a condition caused by bacterial toxins. Symptoms may include fever, rash, skin peeling, and low blood pressure. There may also be symptoms related to the specific underlying infection such as mastitis, osteomyelitis, necrotising fasciitis, or pneumonia.
TSS is typically caused by bacteria of the Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus type, though others may also be involved. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is sometimes referred to as toxic-shock-like syndrome (TSLS)."
Inflammatory Breast Cancer,"Redness, swelling, heat in the skin of the breast, diffuse or localized skin sclerosis, thickening, and uneven surface","Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is one of the most aggressive types of breast cancer. It can occur in women of any age (and, extremely rarely, in men, see male breast cancer). It is referred to as ""inflammatory"" due to its frequent presentation with symptoms resembling a skin inflammation, such as erysipelas. 
Inflammatory breast cancer presents with variable signs and symptoms, frequently without detectable lumps or tumors; it therefore is often not detected by mammography or ultrasound. Typical presentation is rapid breast swelling, sometimes associated with skin changes (peau d'orange), and nipple retraction."
Micropapillary Thyroid Cancer,"Thyroid nodules, bone metastasis, lung metastasis","Thyroid neoplasm is a neoplasm or tumor of the thyroid. It can be a benign tumor such as thyroid adenoma, or it can be a malignant neoplasm (thyroid cancer), such as papillary, follicular, medullary or anaplastic thyroid cancer. Most patients are 25 to 65 years of age when first diagnosed; women are more affected than men.  The estimated number of new cases of thyroid cancer in the United States in 2023 is 43,720 compared to only 2,120 deaths. Of all thyroid nodules discovered, only about 5 percent are cancerous, and under 3 percent of those result in fatalities."
Keratosis Pilaris,"Papules, itching, severe pain","Keratosis pilaris  (KP; also follicular keratosis, lichen pilaris, or colloquially chicken skin.) is a common, autosomal-dominant, genetic condition of the skin's hair follicles characterized by the appearance of possibly itchy, small, gooseflesh-like bumps, with varying degrees of reddening or inflammation. It most often appears on the outer sides of the upper arms (the forearms can also be affected), thighs, face, back, and buttocks; KP can also occur on the hands, and tops of legs, sides, or any body part except glabrous (hairless) skin (like the palms or soles of feet). Often the lesions can appear on the face, which may be mistaken for acne or folliculitis.
The several types of KP have been associated with pregnancy, type 1 diabetes mellitus, obesity, dry skin, allergic diseases (e.g., atopic dermatitis), and rarely cancer. Many rarer types of the disorder are part of inherited genetic syndromes."
Septic Shock,"Fever, drowsiness, coma, confusion, cyanosis of the lips, cold hands and feet","Septic shock is a potentially fatal medical condition that occurs when sepsis, which is organ injury or damage in response to infection, leads to dangerously low blood pressure and abnormalities in cellular metabolism. The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) defines septic shock as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Patients with septic shock can be clinically identified by requiring a vasopressor to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and having serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (>18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia. This combination is associated with hospital mortality rates greater than 40%.
The primary infection is most commonly caused by bacteria, but also may be by fungi, viruses or parasites."
Poor Follicular Development,"Irregular menstruation, infertility, weight gain, hirsutism",Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a cancer that involves certain types of white blood cells known as lymphocytes. This cancer is a form of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and it originates from the uncontrolled division of specific types of B-cells (centrocytes and centroblasts). These cells normally occupy the follicles (nodular swirls of various types of lymphocytes) in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes. The cancerous cells in FL typically form follicular or follicle-like structures (see adjacent Figure) in the tissues they invade. These structures are usually the dominant histological feature of this cancer.
Spinal Metastasis,"Anemia, emaciation, intercostal pain, abdominal pain, hip joint pain, neck pain, muscle atrophy, swelling, mass, low fever, fatigue, decreased appetite","Spinal tumors are neoplasms located in either the vertebral column or the spinal cord. There are three main types of spinal tumors classified based on their location: extradural and intradural (intradural-intramedullary and intradural-extramedullary). Extradural tumors are located outside the dura mater lining and are most commonly metastatic. Intradural tumors are located inside the dura mater lining and are further subdivided into intramedullary and extramedullary tumors. Intradural-intramedullary tumors are located within the dura and spinal cord parenchyma, while intradural-extramedullary tumors are located within the dura but outside the spinal cord parenchyma."
Hairy Cell Leukemia,"Splenomegaly, abdominal distension, fatigue, bleeding tendencies, consumptive weight loss, pancytopenia, erythematous rash, fever","Hairy cell leukemia is an uncommon hematological malignancy characterized by an accumulation of abnormal B lymphocytes. The incidence of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is 0.28-0.30 cases per 100,000 people in Europe and the United States and the prevalence is 3 cases per 100,000 in Europe with a lower prevalence in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.
HCL has an indolent course but with frequent relapses, but with treatment life expectancy is usually the same as that for the general population.
HCL was originally described as histiocytic leukemia, malignant reticulosis, or lymphoid myelofibrosis in publications dating back to the 1920s. The disease was formally named leukemic reticuloendotheliosis, and its characterization was significantly advanced by Bertha Bouroncle and colleagues at the Ohio State University College of Medicine in 1958."
Pelvic Effusion,"Lower abdominal pain, lower abdominal distension pain, lower abdominal dropping pain, lumbosacral pain, lumbar soreness and backache, lower abdominal sagging","In medicine, Meigs's syndrome, also Meigs syndrome or DemonsMeigs syndrome, is the triad of ascites, pleural effusion, and benign ovarian tumor (ovarian fibroma, fibrothecoma, Brenner tumour, and occasionally granulosa cell tumour). Meigs syndrome resolves after the resection of the tumor.  Because the transdiaphragmatic lymphatic channels are larger in diameter on the right, the pleural effusion is classically on the right side. The causes of the ascites and pleural effusion are poorly understood. Atypical Meigs syndrome, characterized by a benign pelvic mass with right-sided pleural effusion but without ascites, can also occur."
Ovarian Thecoma,"Irregular vaginal bleeding, heavy menstrual bleeding, amenorrhea, postmenopausal bleeding, abdominal pain, virilization, clitoromegaly, abnormal hair growth, abdominal bloating, vaginal bleeding","Thecomas or theca cell tumors are benign ovarian neoplasms composed only of theca cells. Histogenetically they are classified as sex cord-stromal tumours. 
They are typically estrogen-producing and they occur in older women (mean age 59; 84% after menopause). (They can, however, appear before menopause.)
60% of patients present with abnormal uterine bleeding, and 20% have endometrial carcinoma.


== Pathologic features ==

Grossly, the tumour is solid and yellow."
Desquamative Interstitial Pneumonia,"Dry cough, shortness of breath, cyanosis, difficulty breathing, rales, hemoptysis, abnormal breathing, both dry and moist rales and wheezing heard in lungs, persistent fever, weight loss, high fever with chills, patchy or lobular fuzzy shadows in the lower lobes of the lungs","Desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) is a type of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia featuring elevated numbers of macrophages within the alveoli of the lung. DIP is a chronic disorder with an insidious onset. Its common symptoms include shortness of breath, coughing, fever, weakness, weight loss, and fatigue. In more severe cases, it may lead to respiratory failure, chest pain, digital clubbing, cyanosis, and hemoptysis. Asymptomatic cases are rare."
Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,"headache and projectile vomiting, disturbance of consciousness, mental disorder, pale complexion, cold sweat, spasm of the neck extensor muscles, motor disorder","Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is bleeding into the subarachnoid spacethe area between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater surrounding the brain. Symptoms may include a severe headache of rapid onset, vomiting, decreased level of consciousness, fever, weakness, numbness, and sometimes seizures. Neck stiffness or neck pain are also relatively common. In about a quarter of people a small bleed with resolving symptoms occurs within a month of a larger bleed.
SAH may occur as a result of a head injury or spontaneously, usually from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm."
Periampullary Cancer,"Jaundice, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bloating, hepatomegaly, weight loss","Periampullary cancer is a cancer that forms near the ampulla of Vater, an enlargement of the ducts from the liver and pancreas where they join and enter the small intestine. It consists of:

ampullary tumour from ampulla of Vater
cancer of lower common bile duct
duodenal cancer adjacent to ampulla
carcinoma head of pancreas
It presents with painless jaundice which may have a waxing and waning nature, because at times the sloughing of the tumor tissue relieves the obstruction partially.


== Signs and symptoms of periampullary cancer ==
Signs and symptoms of periampullary cancer include:

Jaundice (yellowing of skin, eyes and urine with pale stools)
Itching
Abdominal pain
Weight loss and loss of appetite
Recurrent vomiting
Black stools
Anemia


== Treatment ==
Source:
The treatment depends upon the stage of the disease and degree of jaundice. Surgery is the best possible option and can be considered if the cancer is diagnosed at a stage where it can be completely removed by surgery. If the jaundice is very high, the surgeon may choose to decrease jaundice before surgery by doing a procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and stenting."
Meigs' syndrome,"Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, decreased breath sounds, cough, urinary incontinence, shortness of breath, weight loss, chest tightness","In medicine, Meigs's syndrome, also Meigs syndrome or DemonsMeigs syndrome, is the triad of ascites, pleural effusion, and benign ovarian tumor (ovarian fibroma, fibrothecoma, Brenner tumour, and occasionally granulosa cell tumour). Meigs syndrome resolves after the resection of the tumor.  Because the transdiaphragmatic lymphatic channels are larger in diameter on the right, the pleural effusion is classically on the right side. The causes of the ascites and pleural effusion are poorly understood. Atypical Meigs syndrome, characterized by a benign pelvic mass with right-sided pleural effusion but without ascites, can also occur."
Endocardial Fibroelastosis,"Heart failure, difficulty in breathing, pallor, cyanosis of lips, hepatomegaly, abnormal respiration, cardiac arrhythmia, cyanosis, rales, fever, nausea and vomiting, splenomegaly","Endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) is a rare heart disorder usually occurring in children two years old and younger. It may also be considered a reaction to stress, not necessarily a specific disease.
It should not be confused with endomyocardial fibrosis.


== Signs and symptoms ==
EFE is characterized by a thickening of the innermost lining of the heart chambers (the endocardium) due to an increase in the amount of supporting connective tissue and elastic fibres. It is an uncommon cause of unexplained heart failure in infants and children, and is one component of HEC syndrome."
Delayed Stress Reaction,"Palpitations, Panic, Chest tightness, Shortness of breath, Difficulty breathing","Combat stress reaction (CSR) is acute behavioral disorganization as a direct result of the trauma of war. Also known as ""combat fatigue"", ""battle fatigue"", ""operational exhaustion"", or ""battle/war neurosis"", it has some overlap with the diagnosis of acute stress reaction used in civilian psychiatry. It is historically linked to shell shock and is sometimes a precursor to post-traumatic stress disorder.
Combat stress reaction is an acute reaction that includes a range of behaviors resulting from the stress of battle that decrease the combatant's fighting efficiency. The most common symptoms are fatigue, slower reaction times, indecision, disconnection from one's surroundings, and the inability to prioritize."
Bladder Adenocarcinoma,Painless gross hematuria,"Bladder cancer is the abnormal growth of cells in the bladder. These cells can grow to form a tumor, which eventually spreads, damaging the bladder and other organs. Most people with bladder cancer are diagnosed after noticing blood in their urine. Those suspected of having bladder cancer typically have their bladder inspected by a thin medical camera, a procedure called cystoscopy. Suspected tumors are removed and examined to determine if they are cancerous."
Pediatric Cerebrovascular Malformation,"Headache, vomiting, neck stiffness, convulsions, hemiplegia, signs of meningeal irritation, heart failure, increased intracranial pressure, ptosis, respiratory failure, retinal hemorrhage, increased tension in the anterior fontanelle","Cerebrovascular disease includes a variety of medical conditions that affect the blood vessels of the brain and the cerebral circulation. Arteries supplying oxygen and nutrients to the brain are often damaged or deformed in these disorders. The most common presentation of cerebrovascular disease is an ischemic stroke or mini-stroke and sometimes a hemorrhagic stroke. Hypertension (high blood pressure) is the most important contributing risk factor for stroke and cerebrovascular diseases as it can change the structure of blood vessels and result in atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis narrows blood vessels in the brain, resulting in decreased cerebral perfusion."
Oral Ulcer,"Localized ulcer burning pain, oral vesicles, halitosis, lymphadenopathy","A mouth ulcer (aphtha), or sometimes called a canker sore or salt blister, is an ulcer that occurs on the mucous membrane of the oral cavity. Mouth ulcers are very common, occurring in association with many diseases and by many different mechanisms, but usually there is no serious underlying cause. Rarely, a mouth ulcer that does not heal may be a sign of oral cancer. These ulcers may form individually or multiple ulcers may appear at once (i.e., a ""crop"" of ulcers). Once formed, an ulcer may be maintained by inflammation and/or secondary infection."
Hypotonic Cerebral Palsy,"Vertical eye movement disorder, fear of standing and preference for leaning, motor aphasia, decreased muscle tone","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), also known as hemorrhagic stroke, is a sudden bleeding into the tissues of the brain (i.e. the parenchyma), into its ventricles, or into both. An ICH is a type of bleeding within the skull and one kind of stroke (ischemic stroke being the other). Symptoms can vary dramatically depending on the severity (how much blood), acuity (over what timeframe), and location (anatomically) but can include headache, one-sided weakness, numbness, tingling, or paralysis, speech problems, vision or hearing problems, memory loss, attention problems, coordination problems, balance problems, dizziness or lightheadedness or vertigo, nausea/vomiting, seizures, decreased level of consciousness or total loss of consciousness, neck stiffness, and fever.
Hemorrhagic stroke may occur on the background of alterations to the blood vessels in the brain, such as cerebral arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral arteriovenous malformation, brain trauma, brain tumors and an intracranial aneurysm, which can cause intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage."
Diabetes,"Polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, unintentional weight loss, emaciation, fatigue, blurry vision","Diabetes, also known as diabetes  mellitus, is a group of common endocrine diseases characterized by sustained high blood sugar levels. Diabetes is due to either the pancreas not producing enough of the hormone insulin, or the cells of the body becoming unresponsive to insulin's effects. Classic symptoms include polydipsia (excessive thirst), polyuria (excessive urination), polyphagia (excessive hunger), weight loss, and blurred vision. If left untreated, the disease can lead to various health complications, including disorders of the cardiovascular system, eye, kidney, and nerves. Diabetes accounts for approximately 4.2 million deaths every year, with an estimated 1.5 million caused by either untreated or poorly treated diabetes."
Post-transfusion Purpura,"Unexplained fever, reduced immunity","Post-transfusion purpura (PTP) is a delayed adverse reaction to a blood transfusion or platelet transfusion that occurs when the body has produced alloantibodies to the allogeneic transfused platelets' antigens. These alloantibodies destroy the patient's platelets leading to thrombocytopenia, a rapid decline in platelet count. PTP usually presents 512 days after transfusion, and is a potentially fatal condition in rare cases. Approximately 85% of cases occur in women.


== Mechanism ==
PTP is rare, but usually occurs in women who have had multiple pregnancies or in people who have undergone previous transfusions."
Neonatal Hemolytic Disease,"General edema in neonates, pallor, petechiae, pleural effusion, increased limb muscle tone, convulsions, opisthotonos, respiratory failure, hemolytic phenomena, edema, jaundice, hepatomegaly","Hemolytic disease of the newborn, also known as hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, HDN, HDFN, or erythroblastosis fetalis, is an alloimmune condition that develops in a fetus at or around birth, when the IgG molecules (one of the five main types of antibodies) produced by the mother pass through the placenta. Among these antibodies are some which attack antigens on the red blood cells in the fetal circulation, breaking down and destroying the cells. The fetus can develop reticulocytosis and anemia. The intensity of this fetal disease ranges from mild to very severe, and fetal death from heart failure (hydrops fetalis) can occur. When the disease is moderate or severe, many erythroblasts (immature red blood cells) are present in the fetal blood, earning these forms of the disease the name erythroblastosis fetalis (British English: erythroblastosis foetalis
HDFN represents a breach of immune privilege for the fetus or some other form of impairment of the immune tolerance in pregnancy."
Chiasmal Syndrome,"Visual field deficits, vision impairment, optic atrophy, increased intracranial pressure, abnormal pupils","Chiasmal syndrome is the set of signs and symptoms that are associated with lesions of the optic chiasm, manifesting as various impairments of the affected's visual field according to the location of the lesion along the optic nerve. Pituitary adenomas are the most common cause; however, chiasmal syndrome may be caused by cancer, or associated with other medical conditions such as multiple sclerosis and neurofibromatosis.


== Cause ==
Foroozen divides the causes of chiasmal syndromes into intrinsic and extrinsic causes. Intrinsic implies thickening of the chiasm itself and extrinsic implies compression by another structure. Other less common causes of chiasmal syndrome are metabolic, toxic, traumatic or infectious in nature."
Skin Cancer,"Skin keratinization, persistent red skin scars, wart-like proliferation","Skin cancers are cancers that arise from the skin. They are due to the development of abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. It occurs when skin cells grow uncontrollably, forming malignant tumors. The primary cause of skin cancer is prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning devices. Skin cancer is the most commonly diagnosed form of cancer in humans."
Spinocerebellar Degeneration,"Ataxia, Dysarthria, Unsteady Gait, Dysphagia, Coughing, Fatigue","Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a progressive, degenerative, genetic disease with multiple types, each of which could be considered a neurological condition in its own right. An estimated 150,000 people in the United States have a diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia at any given time. SCA is hereditary, progressive, degenerative, and often fatal. There is no known effective treatment or cure. SCA can affect anyone of any age."
Syphilitic Cardiovascular Disease in the Elderly,"Retrosternal pain, cardiac murmurs, angina, left heart failure, arrhythmia, chest pain","Preventive healthcare, or prophylaxis, is the application of healthcare measures to prevent diseases. Disease and disability are affected by environmental factors, genetic predisposition, disease agents, and lifestyle choices, and are dynamic processes that begin before individuals realize they are affected. Disease prevention relies on anticipatory actions that can be categorized as primal, primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention.
Each year, millions of people die of preventable causes. A 2004 study showed that about half of all deaths in the United States in 2000 were due to preventable behaviors and exposures."
Extraskeletal Chondrosarcoma,"Joint swelling, pain, darker coloration","Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma (EMC) is a rare low-grade malignant mesenchymal neoplasm of the soft tissues, that differs from other sarcomas by unique histology and characteristic chromosomal translocations. There is an uncertain differentiation (there is no evidence yet showing that EMC exhibits the feature of cartilaginous differentiation) and neuroendocrine differentiation is even possible.


== Classification ==
EMC was firstly described in 1953 by Stout et al. when they discussed the different species of extraskeletal chondrosarcoma, but EMC concept was firstly proposed in 1972 by Enzinger et al. Brody thought that this was a unique low-grade malignancy with a low growth rate and both clinically and histopathologically distinct anamnesis beside the typical chondrosarcomas."
Pulmonary Cryptococcosis,"Fever, cough, purulent sputum, dyspnea, expectoration, nodules, erythema nodosum, respiratory failure, recurrent pneumonia, anemia, jaundice","Cryptococcosis is a potentially fatal fungal infection of mainly the lungs, presenting as a pneumonia, and in the brain, where it appears as a meningitis. Coughing, difficulty breathing, chest pain and fever are seen when the lungs are infected. When the brain is infected, symptoms include headache, fever, neck pain, nausea and vomiting, light sensitivity and confusion or changes in behavior. It can also affect other parts of the body including skin, where it may appear as several fluid-filled nodules with dead tissue.
It is caused by the fungi Cryptococcus neoformans or less commonly Cryptococcus gattii, and is acquired by breathing in the spores from the air."
Ewing's Sarcoma,"Pain, swelling at the site of the lesion, fever, anemia, poor mental appetite","Ewing sarcoma is a type of pediatric cancer that forms in bone or soft tissue. Symptoms may include swelling and pain at the site of the tumor, fever, and a bone fracture. The most common areas where it begins are the legs, pelvis, and chest wall. In about 25% of cases, the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis. Complications may include a pleural effusion or paraplegia."
Metastatic small bowel tumor,"Abdominal pain initially presents as dull pain, hidden pain, distension pain, worsening after meals, often accompanied by bowel sounds, nausea, vomiting, cessation of anal gas and feces discharge","Spinal tumors are neoplasms located in either the vertebral column or the spinal cord. There are three main types of spinal tumors classified based on their location: extradural and intradural (intradural-intramedullary and intradural-extramedullary). Extradural tumors are located outside the dura mater lining and are most commonly metastatic. Intradural tumors are located inside the dura mater lining and are further subdivided into intramedullary and extramedullary tumors. Intradural-intramedullary tumors are located within the dura and spinal cord parenchyma, while intradural-extramedullary tumors are located within the dura but outside the spinal cord parenchyma."
Superior Mesenteric Artery Embolism,"Abdominal pain, diarrhea, hematochezia, vomiting, tenderness, abdominal muscular rigidity, disappearance of bowel sounds","Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome is a gastro-vascular disorder in which the third and final portion of the duodenum is compressed between the abdominal aorta (AA) and the overlying superior mesenteric artery.  This rare, potentially life-threatening syndrome is typically caused by an angle of 625 between the AA and the SMA, in comparison to the normal range of 3856, due to a lack of retroperitoneal and visceral fat (mesenteric fat). In addition, the aortomesenteric distance is 28 millimeters, as opposed to the typical 1020. However, a narrow SMA angle alone is not enough to make a diagnosis, because patients with a low BMI, most notably children, have been known to have a narrow SMA angle with no symptoms of SMA syndrome.
SMA syndrome is also known as Wilkie's syndrome, cast syndrome, mesenteric root syndrome, chronic duodenal ileus and intermittent arterio-mesenteric occlusion."
Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,"Dull or severe knife-like pain in the abdomen, back, or waist","Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a localized enlargement of the abdominal aorta such that the diameter is greater than 3 cm or more than 50% larger than normal. An AAA usually causes no symptoms, except during rupture. Occasionally, abdominal, back, or leg pain may occur. Large aneurysms can sometimes be felt by pushing on the abdomen. Rupture may result in pain in the abdomen or back, low blood pressure, or loss of consciousness, and often results in death."
Ovarian Granulosa Cell Tumor,"Lower abdominal mass, abdominal distension, ascites, heavy menstrual bleeding, abdominal lump, menstrual irregularities, irregular vaginal bleeding, postmenopausal bleeding, breast tenderness","Granulosa cell tumours are tumours that arise from granulosa cells. They are estrogen-secreting tumours and present as large, complex, ovarian masses. These tumours are part of the sex cordgonadal stromal tumour or non-epithelial group of tumours. Although granulosa cells normally occur only in the ovary, granulosa cell tumours occur in both ovaries and testicles (see ovarian cancer and testicular cancer). These tumours should be considered malignant and treated in the same way as other malignant tumours of ovary."
Pancreatic Tail Cancer,"Abdominal pain, diarrhea, abdominal distension, sensation of an abdominal mass","Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PanNETs, PETs, or PNETs), often referred to as ""islet cell tumours"", or ""pancreatic endocrine tumours"" are neuroendocrine neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous system within the pancreas.
PanNETs are a type of neuroendocrine tumor, representing about one-third of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). Many PanNETs are benign, while some are malignant. Aggressive PanNET tumors have traditionally been termed ""islet cell carcinoma"".
PanNETs are quite distinct from the usual form of pancreatic cancer, the majority of which are adenocarcinomas, which arise in the exocrine pancreas."
Reye's Syndrome in Children,"Nausea, vomiting, lethargy, coma","Reye syndrome is a rapidly worsening brain disease. Symptoms of Reye syndrome may include vomiting, personality changes, confusion, seizures, and loss of consciousness. While liver toxicity typically occurs in the syndrome, jaundice usually does not. Death occurs in 2040% of those affected with Reye syndrome, and about a third of those who survive are left with a significant degree of brain damage.
The cause of Reye syndrome is unknown."
Small Intestinal Adenocarcinoma,"Hematochezia, intestinal perforation, borborygmi, dull pain, nausea, fatigue, abdominal mass, peritoneal irritation signs","Small intestine cancer is a cancer of the small intestine. It is relatively rare compared to other gastrointestinal malignancies such as gastric cancer (stomach cancer) and colorectal cancer.
Small intestine cancer can be subdivided into duodenal cancer (the first part of the small intestine) and cancer of the jejunum and ileum (the latter two parts of the small intestine). Duodenal cancer has more in common with stomach cancer, while cancer of the jejunum and ileum have more in common with colorectal cancer. Five-year survival rates are 65%."
Cerebellar Tonsillar Herniation,"Facial numbness, diplopia, tinnitus, hearing impairment, difficulty in articulation and swallowing, pain in the suboccipital region","Brain herniation is a potentially deadly side effect of very high pressure within the skull that occurs when a part of the brain is squeezed across structures within the skull. The brain can shift across such structures as the falx cerebri, the tentorium cerebelli, and even through the foramen magnum (the hole in the base of the skull through which the spinal cord connects with the brain).  Herniation can be caused by a number of factors that cause a mass effect and increase intracranial pressure (ICP): these include traumatic brain injury, intracranial hemorrhage, or brain tumor.
Herniation can also occur in the absence of high ICP when mass lesions such as hematomas occur at the borders of brain compartments. In such cases local pressure is increased at the place where the herniation occurs, but this pressure is not transmitted to the rest of the brain, and therefore does not register as an increase in ICP.
Because herniation puts extreme pressure on parts of the brain and thereby cuts off the blood supply to various parts of the brain, it is often fatal."
Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in Children,"Depression, Ataxia, Involuntary Movements","CreutzfeldtJakob disease (CJD) is an incurable, always fatal neurodegenerative disease belonging to the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) group. Early symptoms include memory problems, behavioral changes, poor coordination, and visual and/or auditory disturbances. Later symptoms include dementia, involuntary movements, blindness and/or deafness, weakness, and coma. About 70% of people die within a year of diagnosis. The name ""CreutzfeldtJakob disease"" was introduced by Walther Spielmeyer in 1922, after the German neurologists Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt and Alfons Maria Jakob."
Acute and Subacute Subdural Hematoma,"Headache, vomiting, disturbance of consciousness, restlessness","A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a type of bleeding in which a collection of bloodusually but not always associated with a traumatic brain injurygathers between the inner layer of the dura mater and the arachnoid mater of the meninges surrounding the brain. It usually results from rips in bridging veins that cross the subdural space.
Subdural hematomas may cause an increase in the pressure inside the skull, which in turn can cause compression of and damage to delicate brain tissue. Acute subdural hematomas are often life-threatening. Chronic subdural hematomas have a better prognosis if properly managed."
Skin Allergy,"Itching, sudden, painless localized edema, sunlight-induced skin allergies, papules, wheals, photosensitivity, systemic allergic reactions, skin redness, special constitution, wheal-like lesions at skin scratch sites, itchy scratch marks, drug allergic reactions","Allergies, also known as allergic diseases, are various conditions caused by hypersensitivity of the immune system to typically harmless substances in the environment. These diseases include hay fever, food allergies, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and anaphylaxis. Symptoms may include red eyes, an itchy rash, sneezing, coughing, a runny nose, shortness of breath, or swelling. Note that food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions.
Common allergens include pollen and certain foods."
Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis (PVNS),"Joint pain, Malaise, Fever, Joint swelling, Muscle atrophy","Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) is a non-malignant tumor defined histologically as inclusions of osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells, hemosiderin, and macrophages. This histology can present one of 2 clinically distinct ways. Localized/nodular TGCT (L-TGCT), sometimes referred to as giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath;:100 is a common tumor that presents as a slow-growing, encapsulated, localized and limited bump, most frequently in the fingers.  Diffuse TGCT (D-TGCT)  also called pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a rare tumor that presents as a proliferative, destructive, intra-articular lesion, most commonly in the knee.:102  D-TGCT tumors often develop from the lining of joints (also known as synovial tissue).:100:245. Common symptoms of D-TGCT include swelling, pain, stiffness and reduced mobility in the affected joint or limb.:102


== Classification ==
Classification for TGCT encompasses two subtypes that can be divided according to site  within a joint (intra-articular) or outside of the joint (extra-articular)  and growth pattern (localized or diffuse) of the tumor(s).:100:361 Localized and diffuse subsets of TGCT differ in their prognosis, clinical presentation, and biological behavior, but share a similar manner of disease development.:100


=== Localized TGCT ===

Localized TGCT is sometimes referred to as localized pigmented villonodular synovitis (L-PVNS), giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath (GCT-TS), nodular tenosynovitis, localized nodular tenosynovitis, and L-TGCT.:1:100

Neonatal Edema,"Subcutaneous edema, hypothermia, lethargy, reduced crying, feeding difficulties, slow suckling, or even refusal of food, abdominal distention, constipation","Cerebral edema is excess accumulation of fluid (edema) in the intracellular or extracellular spaces of the brain. This typically causes impaired nerve function, increased pressure within the skull, and can eventually lead to direct compression of brain tissue and blood vessels. Symptoms vary based on the location and extent of edema and generally include headaches, nausea, vomiting, seizures, drowsiness, visual disturbances, dizziness, and in severe cases, death.
Cerebral edema is commonly seen in a variety of brain injuries including ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain injury, subdural, epidural, or intracerebral hematoma, hydrocephalus, brain cancer, brain infections, low blood sodium levels, high altitude, and acute liver failure. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and physical examination findings and confirmed by serial neuroimaging (computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging)."
Chronic Adrenal Insufficiency,"Pigmentation abnormalities, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, weight loss, somnolence, adrenal crisis, diarrhea, vision impairment, diplopia, psychiatric disorders, convulsions","Adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce adequate amounts of steroid hormones. The adrenal glandsalso referred to as the adrenal cortexnormally secrete glucocorticoids (primarily cortisol), mineralocorticoids (primarily aldosterone), and androgens. These hormones are important in regulating blood pressure, electrolytes, and metabolism as a whole. Deficiency of these hormones leads to symptoms ranging from abdominal pain, vomiting, muscle weakness and fatigue, low blood pressure, depression, mood and personality changes (in mild cases) to organ failure and shock (in severe cases). Adrenal crisis may occur if a person having adrenal insufficiency experiences stresses, such as an accident, injury, surgery, or severe infection; this is a life-threatening medical condition resulting from severe deficiency of cortisol in the body."
Rectal Polyps,"Polyps, anal papilla hypertrophy, polypoid lesions, tenesmus, rectal bleeding, sensation of incomplete bowel evacuation, purulent bloody stool, bright red blood per rectum","A colorectal polyp is a polyp (fleshy growth) occurring on the lining of the colon or rectum. Untreated colorectal polyps can develop into colorectal cancer.
Colorectal polyps are often classified by their behaviour (i.e. benign vs. malignant) or cause (e.g."
Megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome,"Abdominal distension, megacystis, dilatation of the small intestine, decreased peristalsis","Berdon syndrome, also called megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIH syndrome), is a generally fatal autosomal recessive genetic disorder affecting the bladder, colon, and intestines.
It is more prevalent in females (7 females to 3 males) and is characterized by constipation and urinary retention, microcolon, giant bladder (megacystis), intestinal hypoperistalsis, hydronephrosis, and dilated small bowel. The pathological findings consist of an abundance of ganglion cells in both dilated and narrow areas of the intestine. It is a familial disturbance of unknown cause.
Walter Berdon et al."
Orbital Cellulitis,"High fever, chills, and symptoms of meningeal irritation","Orbital cellulitis  is inflammation of eye tissues behind the orbital septum. It is most commonly caused by an acute spread of infection into the eye socket from either the adjacent sinuses or through the blood. It may also occur after trauma.  When it affects the rear of the eye, it is known as retro-orbital cellulitis.
Without proper treatment, orbital cellulitis may lead to serious consequences, including permanent loss of vision or even death."
Pulmonary Hernia,"Chest pain, pneumothorax, thoracic deformity, difficulty in breathing","Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a birth defect of the diaphragm.  The most common type of CDH is a Bochdalek hernia;  other types include Morgagni hernia, diaphragm eventration and central tendon defects of the diaphragm.  Malformation of the diaphragm allows the abdominal organs to push into the chest cavity, hindering proper lung formation.
CDH is a life-threatening pathology in infants and a major cause of death due to two complications: pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension.  Experts disagree on the relative importance of these two conditions, with some focusing on hypoplasia, others on hypertension."
Iridocorneal Endothelial Syndrome,"Blurred vision in one eye, discomfort, eye pain, and eye swelling","Iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndromes are a spectrum of diseases characterized by slowly progressive abnormalities of the corneal endothelium and features including corneal edema, iris distortion, and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. ICE syndromes are predominantly unilateral and nonhereditary. The condition occurs in predominantly middle-aged women.Iridocorneal Endothelial (ICE) syndrome presents a unique set of challenges for both patients and ophthalmologists, and effective treatment of this group of rare  ocular diseases requires a combination of diagnostic and therapeutic complexity. It's important to understand. [1]


== Signs and symptoms ==
Many cases are asymptomatic, however patients many have decreased vision, glare, monocular diplopia or polyopia, and noticeable iris changes."
Dieulafoy's Lesion,"Hematemesis, melena, bleeding, shock","Dieulafoy's lesion (French: [djlafwa]) is a medical condition characterized by a large tortuous artery most commonly in the stomach wall (submucosal) that erodes and bleeds. It can present in any part of the gastrointestinal tract. It can cause gastric hemorrhage but is relatively uncommon. It is thought to cause less than 5% of all gastrointestinal bleeds in adults. It was named after French surgeon Paul Georges Dieulafoy, who described this condition in his paper ""Exulceratio simplex: Leons 1-3"" in 1898."
Occupational Skin Cancer,"Ulcers, Scars","Occupational cancer is cancer caused by occupational hazards. Several cancers have been directly tied to occupational hazards, including chimney sweeps' carcinoma, mesothelioma, and others.


== Types of hazards ==
Occupational exposure to chemicals, dusts, radiation, and certain industrial processes have been tied to occupational cancer. Exposure to cancer-causing chemicals (carcinogens) may cause mutations that allow cells to grow out of control, causing cancer. Carcinogens in the workplace may include chemicals like anilines, chromates, dinitrotoluenes, arsenic and inorganic arsenic compounds, beryllium and beryllium compounds, cadmium compounds, and nickel compounds."
Choroidal Metastatic Cancer,"Spontaneous intraocular hemorrhage, extraocular metastasis, gray-white nodules, eye pain, vision disorders","Uveal melanoma is a type of eye cancer in the uvea of the eye. It is traditionally classed as originating in the iris, choroid, and ciliary body, but can also be divided into class I (low metastatic risk) and class II (high metastatic risk). Symptoms include blurred vision, loss of vision, and photopsia, but there may be no symptoms.
Tumors arise from the pigment cells that reside within the uvea and give color to the eye. These melanocytes are distinct from the retinal pigment epithelium cells underlying the retina that do not form melanomas."
Cervical Spine Fracture and Dislocation without Spinal Cord Injury,"Neck pain, involuntary forward tilting of the head and neck with stiff deformity, reduced range of motion in the neck, sometimes with limited rotation","A cervical fracture, commonly called a broken neck, is a fracture of any of the seven cervical vertebrae in the neck. Examples of common causes in humans are traffic collisions and diving into shallow water. Abnormal movement of neck bones or pieces of bone can cause a spinal cord injury, resulting in loss of sensation, paralysis, or usually death soon thereafter (~1 min.), primarily via compromising neurological supply to the respiratory muscles and innervation to the heart.


== Causes ==

Considerable force is needed to cause a cervical fracture. Vehicle collisions and falls are common causes."
Pediatric Hodgkin's Disease,"Painless lymph node enlargement, fever, fatigue, anorexia, slight weight loss, itching","Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a type of lymphoma in which cancer originates from a specific type of white blood cell called lymphocytes, where multinucleated ReedSternberg cells (RS cells) are present in the lymph nodes. The condition was named after the English physician Thomas Hodgkin, who first described it in 1832. Symptoms may include fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Often, non-painful enlarged lymph nodes occur in the neck, under the arm, or in the groin. Persons affected may feel tired or be itchy."
Pseudomonas aeruginosa Meningitis,"Fever, shock, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common encapsulated, Gram-negative, aerobicfacultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium that can cause disease in plants and animals, including humans. A species of considerable medical importance, P. aeruginosa is a multidrug resistant pathogen recognized for its ubiquity, its intrinsically advanced antibiotic resistance mechanisms, and its association with serious illnesses  hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and various sepsis syndromes. P. aeruginosa is able to selectively inhibit various antibiotics from penetrating its outer membrane - and has high resistance to several antibiotics. According to the World Health Organization P. aeruginosa poses one of the greatest threats to humans in terms of antibiotic resistance.
The organism is considered opportunistic insofar as serious infection often occurs during existing diseases or conditions  most notably cystic fibrosis and traumatic burns."
Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma,"Chest pain, shortness of breath, cachexia, reduced or absent breath sounds","Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium). The area most commonly affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding each testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly."
Chondrosarcoma,"Pain, Tumoral compression, Joint swelling, Radiating pain, Body ache","Chondrosarcoma is a bone sarcoma, a primary cancer composed of cells derived from transformed cells that produce cartilage. A chondrosarcoma is a member of a category of tumors of bone and soft tissue known as sarcomas.  About 30% of bone sarcomas are chondrosarcomas. It is resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Unlike other primary bone sarcomas that mainly affect children and adolescents, a chondrosarcoma can present at any age."
Hypoventilation Syndrome,"Apathy, headache, fatigue, drowsiness, abnormal breath, metabolic acidosis, cloudy consciousness, nausea and vomiting, mucosal damage, alveolitis, hyperpnea, and abnormal respiration","Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is a condition in which severely overweight people fail to breathe rapidly or deeply enough, resulting in low oxygen levels and high blood carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. The syndrome is often associated with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which causes periods of absent or reduced breathing in sleep, resulting in many partial awakenings during the night and sleepiness during the day. The disease puts strain on the heart, which may lead to heart failure and leg swelling.
Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is defined as the combination of obesity and an increased blood carbon dioxide level during the day that is not attributable to another cause of excessively slow or shallow breathing.
The most effective treatment is weight loss, but this may require bariatric surgery to achieve."
Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) in Adolescents,"Polydipsia, polyuria, postprandial hyperglycemia, elevated blood glucose levels","Diabetes, also known as diabetes  mellitus, is a group of common endocrine diseases characterized by sustained high blood sugar levels. Diabetes is due to either the pancreas not producing enough of the hormone insulin, or the cells of the body becoming unresponsive to insulin's effects. Classic symptoms include polydipsia (excessive thirst), polyuria (excessive urination), polyphagia (excessive hunger), weight loss, and blurred vision. If left untreated, the disease can lead to various health complications, including disorders of the cardiovascular system, eye, kidney, and nerves. Diabetes accounts for approximately 4.2 million deaths every year, with an estimated 1.5 million caused by either untreated or poorly treated diabetes."
Parasitic myocarditis,"Chest tightness, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, palpitations","Myocarditis is inflammation of the cardiac muscle. Myocarditis can progress to inflammatory cardiomyopathy when there is associated ventricular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction due to chronic inflammation. Symptoms can include shortness of breath, chest pain, decreased ability to exercise, and an irregular heartbeat. The duration of problems can vary from hours to months. Complications may include heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy or cardiac arrest."
Pediatric Guillain-Barr Syndrome,"Motor dysfunction, sensory disturbance, choking cough, hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, accumulation of saliva in the mouth","GuillainBarr syndrome (GBS) is a rapid-onset muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. Typically, both sides of the body are involved, and the initial symptoms are changes in sensation or pain often in the back along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands, often spreading to the arms and upper body. The symptoms may develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening, with about 15% of people developing respiratory muscle weakness requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in the function of the autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure."
Relapsing Polychondritis,"Red, swollen, hot, and painful auricle; sudden collapse of the nasal bridge; frequent nasal congestion, nasal discharge, and nasal chondritis; migratory, asymmetrical, non-deforming arthritis.","Relapsing polychondritis is a systemic disease characterized by repeated episodes of inflammation and in some cases deterioration of cartilage. The disease can be life-threatening if the respiratory tract, heart valves, or blood vessels are affected. The exact mechanism is poorly understood.
The diagnosis is reached on the basis of the symptoms and supported by investigations such as blood tests and sometimes other investigations. Treatment may involve symptomatic treatment with painkillers or anti-inflammatory medications, and more severe cases may require suppression of the immune system."
Acute Glomerulonephritis,"Proteinuria, hypertension, oliguria, azotemia, hematuria with proteinuria, edema, eyelid swelling, anuria, fatigue, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, dizziness","Acute proliferative glomerulonephritis is a disorder of the small blood vessels of the kidney.

It can be a risk factor for future albuminuria. In adults, the signs and symptoms of infection may still be present at the time when the kidney problems develop, and the terms infection-related glomerulonephritis or bacterial infection-related glomerulonephritis are also used. Acute glomerulonephritis resulted in 19,000 deaths in 2013, down from 24,000 deaths in 1990 worldwide."

RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, responsible for approximately 9095% of cases. It is more common in men (with a male-to-female ratio of up to 2:1). It is most commonly diagnosed in the elderly (especially in people over 75 years of age).
Initial treatment is most commonly either partial or complete removal of the affected kidney(s)."
Blood Stasis,"Pain, ecchymosis, cyanosis","Blood stasis (also blood stagnation and blood stasis syndrome) (BS) is a concept in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), described as a slowing or pooling of the blood due to a disruption of heart qi. Blood stasis is also described by practitioners of TCM in terms of yin deficiency, qi deficiency and qi stagnation. For non-practitioners of TCM it is sometimes explained in terms of hematological disorders such as hemorrhage, congestion, thrombosis or local ischemia, and in terms of tissue changes. TCM practitioners believe it is an important underlying pathology of many disease processes despite the fact that objective, consistent methods for measuring the presence of blood stasis syndrome are not readily available. Blood stasis is associated with justifications for acupuncture and herbal treatments."
Ewing's Sarcoma,"Pain, swelling at the site of the lesion, fever, anemia, poor mental appetite","Ewing sarcoma is a type of pediatric cancer that forms in bone or soft tissue. Symptoms may include swelling and pain at the site of the tumor, fever, and a bone fracture. The most common areas where it begins are the legs, pelvis, and chest wall. In about 25% of cases, the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis. Complications may include a pleural effusion or paraplegia."
Free-Living Amebic Infection,"Fever, vomiting, eye pain, headache, coma, tearing, cerebral edema, paralysis, photosensitivity, delirium, neck stiffness, nausea","Free-living amoebae (or ""FLA"") are a group of protozoa that are important causes of infectious disease in humans and animals.
Naegleria fowleri is often included in the group ""free-living amoebae"", and this species causes a usually fatal condition traditionally called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). However, the genus Naegleria is now considered part of the Excavata, not the Amoebozoa, and is considered to be much more closely related to Leishmania and Trypanosoma.


== Presentation ==
Acanthamoeba spp. causes mostly subacute or chronic granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE), with a clinical picture of headaches, altered mental status, and focal neurologic deficit, which progresses over several weeks to death."
Aortic Stenosis,"Chest tightness, palpitations, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing","Aortic stenosis (AS or AoS) is the narrowing  of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aorta begins), such that problems result. It may occur at the aortic valve as well as above and below this level. It typically gets worse over time. Symptoms often come on gradually with a decreased ability to exercise often occurring first. If heart failure, loss of consciousness, or heart related chest pain occur due to AS the outcomes are worse."
Polycythemia Vera,"Increased red blood cells, increased white blood cells, increased platelets, hepatosplenomegaly, nosebleeds, gum bleeding, erythromelalgia, dizziness, headache, hypertension","In oncology, polycythemia vera (PV) is an uncommon myeloproliferative neoplasm in which the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells.  The majority of cases are caused by mutations in the JAK2 gene, most commonly resulting in a single amino acid change in its protein product from valine to phenylalanine at position 617.
Most of the health concerns associated with polycythemia vera are caused by the blood being thicker as a result of the increased red blood cells.  It is more common in the elderly and may be symptomatic or asymptomatic.  Common signs and symptoms include itching (pruritus), and severe burning pain in the hands or feet that is usually accompanied by a reddish or bluish coloration of the skin."

Pulmonary Artery Hypoplasia,"Hemoptysis, Dyspnea, Wheezing, Difficulty Breathing, Vomiting, Dysphagia, Respiratory Infection","Pulmonary hypoplasia is an incomplete development of the lungs, resulting in an abnormally low number or small size of bronchopulmonary segments or alveoli.  A congenital malformation, most often occurs secondary to other fetal abnormalities that interfere with normal development of the lungs.  Primary (idiopathic) pulmonary hypoplasia is rare and usually not associated with other maternal or fetal abnormalities.
Incidence of pulmonary hypoplasia ranges from 911 per 10,000 live births and 14 per 10,000 births.  Pulmonary hypoplasia is a relatively common cause of neonatal death."
Carcinoid Syndrome,"Hematochezia, borborygmi, hypotension, nausea, pulmonary masses, abdominal masses, abdominal pain, diarrhea","Carcinoid syndrome is a paraneoplastic syndrome comprising the signs and symptoms that occur secondary to neuroendocrine tumors (formerly known as carcinoid tumors). The syndrome is caused by neuroendocrine tumors most often found in the gut releasing biologically active substances into the blood causing symptoms such as flushing and diarrhea, and less frequently, heart failure, vomiting and bronchoconstriction.


== Signs and symptoms ==

The carcinoid syndrome occurs in approximately 10% of all neuroendocrine tumors or about 3040% of more advanced/well developed neuroendocrine tumors. The biologically active substances that are released by the tumors cause the symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome. These substances act on the vessels to produce the symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome."
Pleural Disease,"Pain, Edema, Fever, Difficulty Breathing","Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium). The area most commonly affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding each testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly."
Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding (DUB),"Irregular vaginal bleeding, anemia, irregular menstrual cycle","Abnormal uterine bleeding is vaginal bleeding from the uterus that is abnormally frequent, lasts excessively long, is heavier than normal, or is irregular. The term ""dysfunctional uterine bleeding"" was used when no underlying cause was present. Quality of life may be negatively affected.
The underlying causes may be structural or non-structural and are classified in accordance with the FIGO system 1 & 2. Common causes include: Ovulation problems, fibroids, the lining of the uterus growing into the uterine wall, uterine polyps, underlying bleeding problems, side effects from birth control, or cancer."
Hepatic Artery Occlusion,"Hepatic congestion, jaundice, fever","Atherosclerosis is a pattern of the disease arteriosclerosis, characterized by development of abnormalities called lesions in walls of arteries. This is a chronic inflammatory disease involving many different cell types and is driven by elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood. These lesions may lead to narrowing of the arterial walls due to buildup of atheromatous plaques. At the onset there are usually no symptoms, but if they develop, symptoms generally begin around middle age. In severe cases, it can result in coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or kidney disorders, depending on which body part(s) the affected arteries are located in the body."
Infantile Myofibromatosis,"Multiple firm dermal and subcutaneous nodules, appearing at birth or shortly thereafter, commonly located on the head, neck, and trunk.","Infantile myofibromatosis (IMF) is a rare tumor found in 1 in 150,000 to 1 in 400,000 live births. It is nonetheless the most common tumor derived from fibrous connective tissue that occurs primarily in infants and young children. IMF tumors are benign in the sense that they do not metastasize to distant tissues although when occurring in the viscera, i.e. internal organs, carry guarded to poor prognoses and can be life-threatening, particularly in newborns and young infants. The condition was first described by Arthur Purdy Stout as congenital generalized fibromatosis  in which he coined the word fibromatosis  in 1954."
Omental Adhesion Syndrome,"Progressively worsening right-sided abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, abdominal pain","A bowel resection or enterectomy (enter- + -ectomy) is a surgical procedure in which a part of an intestine (bowel) is removed, from either the small intestine or large intestine. Often the word enterectomy is reserved for the sense of small bowel resection, in distinction from colectomy, which covers the sense of large bowel resection. Bowel resection may be performed to treat gastrointestinal cancer, bowel ischemia, necrosis, or obstruction due to scar tissue, volvulus, and hernias. Some patients require ileostomy or colostomy after this procedure as alternative means of excretion. Complications of the procedure may include anastomotic leak or dehiscence, hernias, or adhesions causing partial or complete bowel obstruction."
Follicular Keratosis,"Pulmonary fibrosis, Bone cysts, Scab, Nodules, Severe itching, Scales, Slow or thin pulse, Leukoplakia","A seborrheic keratosis is a non-cancerous (benign) skin tumour that originates from cells, namely keratinocytes, in the outer layer of the skin called the epidermis. Like liver spots, seborrheic keratoses are seen more often as people age.
The tumours (also called lesions) appear in various colours, from light tan to black. They are round or oval, feel flat or slightly elevated, like the scab from a healing wound, and range in size from very small to more than 2.5 centimetres (1 in) across. They are often associated with other skin conditions, including basal cell carcinoma."
Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS),"Lower abdominal discomfort, heaviness or mild pain, poor appetite, enlarged ovaries up to 5cm in diameter, nausea, vomiting, thirst, occasional diarrhea, weight gain","Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a medical condition that can occur in some women who take fertility medication to stimulate egg growth, and in other women in sporadic cases. Most cases are mild, but rarely the condition is severe and can lead to serious illness or even death.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Mild symptoms include abdominal bloating and feeling of fullness, nausea, diarrhea, and slight weight gain. Moderate symptoms include weight gain greater than 1 kg (2.2 lb) per day, increased abdominal girth, vomiting, diarrhea, darker urine, decreased urine output, excessive thirst, and skin and/or hair feeling dry (in addition to mild symptoms). Severe symptoms are fullness/bloating above the waist, shortness of breath, pleural effusion, urination significantly darker or diminished in quantity, calf and chest pain, marked abdominal bloating or distention, and lower abdominal pain."
Cutaneous Leukemia,"Papules, nodules, ulcers, cold and pale sticky skin, persistent low-grade fever, secondary infections, dull skin, red or purple slightly elevated papules or nodules.","Leukemia cutis is the infiltration of neoplastic leukocytes or their precursors into the skin resulting in clinically identifiable cutaneous lesions. This condition may be contrasted with leukemids, which are skin lesions that occur with leukemia, but which are not related to leukemic cell infiltration. Leukemia cutis can occur in most forms of leukemia, including chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and prolymphocytic leukemia.
Aleukemic leukemia cutis occurs when cancerous white blood cells penetrate the skin before they are detected in the bone marrow or peripheral circulation.


== Signs and symptoms ==
The clinical appearance of leukemia cutis varies, with the most common lesions being erythematous to violaceous papules or nodules (60%), followed by infiltrating plaques, generalized cutaneous eruption, and erythroderma."
Guillain-Barr Syndrome,"Motor dysfunction, limb paralysis, limb numbness, limb disorders, sensory disturbances","GuillainBarr syndrome (GBS) is a rapid-onset muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. Typically, both sides of the body are involved, and the initial symptoms are changes in sensation or pain often in the back along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands, often spreading to the arms and upper body. The symptoms may develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening, with about 15% of people developing respiratory muscle weakness requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in the function of the autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure."
Paraneoplastic Neurological Syndromes (PNS),"Diplopia, muscle spasms, weakness, strabismus, dizziness, Babinski's sign positive","A paraneoplastic syndrome is a syndrome (a set of signs and symptoms) that is the consequence of a tumor in the body (usually a cancerous one). It is specifically due to the production of chemical signaling molecules (such as hormones or cytokines) by tumor cells or by an immune response against the tumor. Unlike a mass effect, it is not due to the local presence of cancer cells.
Paraneoplastic syndromes are typical among middle-aged to older people, and they most commonly occur with cancers of the lung, breast, ovaries or lymphatic system (a lymphoma). Sometimes, the symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes show before the diagnosis of a malignancy, which has been hypothesized to relate to the disease pathogenesis."
Keratosis Pilaris,"Papules, itching, severe pain","Keratosis pilaris  (KP; also follicular keratosis, lichen pilaris, or colloquially chicken skin.) is a common, autosomal-dominant, genetic condition of the skin's hair follicles characterized by the appearance of possibly itchy, small, gooseflesh-like bumps, with varying degrees of reddening or inflammation. It most often appears on the outer sides of the upper arms (the forearms can also be affected), thighs, face, back, and buttocks; KP can also occur on the hands, and tops of legs, sides, or any body part except glabrous (hairless) skin (like the palms or soles of feet). Often the lesions can appear on the face, which may be mistaken for acne or folliculitis.
The several types of KP have been associated with pregnancy, type 1 diabetes mellitus, obesity, dry skin, allergic diseases (e.g., atopic dermatitis), and rarely cancer. Many rarer types of the disorder are part of inherited genetic syndromes."
Barrett's Esophagus,"symptoms of esophageal reflux, gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, heartburn, dysphagia, burning pain behind the sternum, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting","Barrett's esophagus is a condition in which there is an abnormal (metaplastic) change in the mucosal cells that line the lower part of the esophagus. The cells change from stratified squamous epithelium to simple columnar epithelium, interspersed with goblet cells that are normally only found in the small intestine and large intestine. This change is considered to be a premalignant condition because of its potential to transition into esophageal adenocarcinoma, an often-deadly cancer.
The main cause of Barrett's esophagus is tissue adaptation to chronic acid exposure caused by reflux from the stomach. Barrett's esophagus is diagnosed by endoscopy to visually observe the lower esophagus, followed by a biopsy of the affected area and microscopic examination of that tissue."
Intracranial Metastatic Tumor,"Maculopapular rash, edematous red papules, cough, asthma, fever","Metastatic breast cancer, also referred to as metastases, advanced breast cancer, secondary tumors, secondaries or stage IV breast cancer, is a stage of breast cancer where the breast cancer cells have spread to distant sites beyond the axillary lymph nodes. There is no cure for metastatic breast cancer;  there is no stage after IV.
Metastases can occur several years after the primary breast cancer, although it is sometimes diagnosed at the same time as the primary breast cancer or, rarely, before the primary breast cancer has been diagnosed.
Metastatic breast cancer cells frequently differ from the preceding primary breast cancer in properties such as receptor status. The cells have often developed resistance to several lines of previous treatment and have acquired special properties that permit them to metastasize to distant sites. Metastatic breast cancer can be treated, sometimes for many years, but it cannot be cured."
Calicivirus Gastroenteritis,"Nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, malaise, fever, rash","Feline calicivirus (FCV) is a virus of the family Caliciviridae that causes disease in cats.  It is one of the two important viral causes of respiratory infection in cats, the other being feline herpesvirus.  FCV can be isolated from about 50% of cats with upper respiratory infections.  Cheetahs are the other species of the family Felidae known to become infected naturally.


== Viral structure and pathogenesis ==
Different strains of FCV can vary in virulence (the degree of pathogenicity within a group or species of microorganisms or viruses as indicated by case fatality rates and/or the ability of the organism to invade the tissues of the host)."
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma,"Sensation of ear blockage, perforation of the palate, feeling of unblown nasal discharge, dysphagia, mouth breathing, coma, tongue muscle atrophy, swelling at the base of the nose, foreign body sensation in the throat, narrowing of the nasopharyngeal cavity, deviation of the tongue, blood-streaked purulent nasal discharge","Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), or nasopharynx cancer, is the most common cancer originating in the nasopharynx, most commonly in the postero-lateral nasopharynx or pharyngeal recess (fossa of Rosenmller), accounting for 50% of cases. NPC occurs in children and adults.  NPC differs significantly from other cancers of the head and neck in its occurrence, causes, clinical behavior, and treatment. It is vastly more common in certain regions of East Asia and Africa than elsewhere, with viral, dietary and genetic factors implicated in its causation. It is most common in males."
Anhidrosis,"General malaise, fatigue, dry skin, rough skin, dry heat without sweating, absence of sweat, and closed sweat phenomenon","Hypohidrosis is a medical condition in which a person exhibits diminished sweating in response to appropriate stimuli. In contrast with hyperhidrosis, which is a socially troubling yet often benign condition, the consequences of untreated hypohidrosis include hyperthermia, heat stroke and death. An extreme case of hypohidrosis in which there is a complete absence of sweating and the skin is dry is termed anhidrosis. The condition is also known as adiaphoresis, ischidrosis, oligidria, oligohidrosis and sweating deficiency.


== Causes ==
The causes are the following:


== Diagnosis ==
Sweat is readily visualized by a topical indicator such as iodinated starch (Minor test) or sodium alizarin sulphonate, both of which undergo a dramatic colour change when moistened by sweat."
Tuberculosis,"Cough, hemoptysis, fever, night sweats, and gradual weight loss, etc.","Tuberculosis (TB), also known colloquially as the ""white death"", or historically as consumption, is a contagious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteria. Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections show no symptoms, in which case it is known as inactive or latent tuberculosis. A small proportion of latent infections progress to active disease that, if left untreated, can be fatal. Typical symptoms of active TB are chronic cough with blood-containing mucus, fever, night sweats, and weight loss."
Avascular Necrosis,"Discomfort in the hip, hip pain, increased pain after fatigue or long periods of activity, alleviation of pain after rest, pain in the lumbar sacral region or knee joint","Avascular necrosis (AVN), also called osteonecrosis or bone infarction, is death of bone tissue due to interruption of the blood supply. Early on, there may be no symptoms. Gradually joint pain may develop, which may limit the person's ability to move. Complications may include collapse of the bone or nearby joint surface.
Risk factors include bone fractures, joint dislocations, alcoholism, and the use of high-dose steroids."
Meningeal Metastasis,"Nodules, headache, dizziness, vomiting","Leptomeningeal cancer is a rare complication of cancer in which the disease spreads from the original tumor site to the meninges surrounding the brain and spinal cord. This leads to an inflammatory response, hence the alternative names neoplastic meningitis (NM), malignant meningitis, or carcinomatous meningitis. The term leptomeningeal (from the Greek lepto, meaning 'fine' or 'slight') describes the thin meninges, the arachnoid and the pia mater, between which the cerebrospinal fluid is located. The disorder was originally reported by Eberth in 1870. It is also known as leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, leptomeningeal disease (LMD), leptomeningeal metastasis, meningeal metastasis and meningeal carcinomatosis."
Primary Chronic Angle-Closure Glaucoma,"Increased intraocular pressure, halos around lights, dizziness, optic nerve atrophy, headache, narrowed visual field, eye fatigue, segmental atrophy of the iris, abnormal pupil, eye pain","Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can lead to damage of the optic nerve. The optic nerve transmits visual information from the eye to the brain. Glaucoma may cause vision loss if left untreated. It has been called the ""silent thief of sight"" because the loss of vision usually occurs slowly over a long period of time. A major risk factor for glaucoma is increased pressure within the eye, known as intraocular pressure (IOP)."
Keshan Disease in Children,"Cardiomegaly, headache, chest pain, abnormal sweating, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness","Keshan disease is a congestive cardiomyopathy caused by a combination of dietary deficiency of selenium and the presence of a mutated strain of Coxsackievirus, named after Keshan County of Heilongjiang province, Northeast China, where symptoms were first noted. These symptoms were later found prevalent in a wide belt extending from northeast to southwest China, all due to selenium-deficient soil. The disease peaked in 19601970, killing thousands of people.
Often fatal, the disease affects children and women of child-bearing age, characterized by heart failure and pulmonary edema. Over decades, supplementation with selenium reduced this condition."
Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD),"Pain in the liver area, fever, anorexia, nausea, vomiting","Fatty liver disease (FLD), also known as hepatic steatosis and steatotic liver disease (SLD), is a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver. Often there are no or few symptoms. Occasionally there may be tiredness or pain in the upper right side of the abdomen. Complications may include cirrhosis, liver cancer, and esophageal varices.
The main subtypes of fatty liver disease are metabolic dysfunctionassociated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, formerly ""non-alcoholic fatty liver disease"" (NAFLD)) and alcoholic liver disease (ALD), with the category ""metabolic and alcohol associated liver disease"" (metALD) describing an overlap of the two."
Burns Sepsis,"Decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, moist and liquefied wound surfaces, bleeding, ulceration, shortness of breath","Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs.
This initial stage of sepsis is followed by suppression of the immune system. Common signs and symptoms include fever, increased heart rate, increased breathing rate, and confusion. There may also be symptoms related to a specific infection, such as a cough with pneumonia, or painful urination with a kidney infection. The very young, old, and people with a weakened immune system may not have any symptoms that are specific to their infection, and their body temperature may be low or normal instead of constituting a fever."
Acute Ovarian and Fallopian Tube Torsion,"Abdominal pain, dizziness, vaginal bleeding, pale complexion","Ectopic pregnancy is a complication of pregnancy in which the embryo attaches outside the uterus. Signs and symptoms classically include abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding, but fewer than 50 percent of affected women have both of these symptoms. The pain may be described as sharp, dull, or crampy. Pain may also spread to the shoulder if bleeding into the abdomen has occurred. Severe bleeding may result in a fast heart rate, fainting, or shock."
Echovirus Exanthem,"Fever, sore throat, rhinorrhea, cough","Coxsackieviruses are a few related enteroviruses that belong to the Picornaviridae family of nonenveloped, linear, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, as well as its genus Enterovirus, which also includes poliovirus and echovirus. Enteroviruses are among the most common and important human pathogens, and ordinarily its members are transmitted by the fecaloral route. Coxsackieviruses share many characteristics with poliovirus. With control of poliovirus infections in much of the world, more attention has been focused on understanding the nonpolio enteroviruses such as coxsackievirus.
Coxsackieviruses are among the leading causes of aseptic meningitis (the other usual suspects being echovirus and mumps virus)."
Pharyngeal Teratoma,"Congestion in the pharyngeal area, dry and congested throat, foreign body sensation in the throat, abnormal breathing, tracheal gap mass formation, difficulty swallowing, nausea and vomiting, nasal discharge","Epignathus is a rare teratoma of the oropharynx. Epignathus is a form of oropharyngeal teratoma that arises from the palate and, in most cases, results in death. The pathology is thought to be due to unorganized and uncontrolled differentiation of somatic cells leading to formation of the teratoma; sometimes it is also referred to as fetus in fetu, which is an extremely rare occurrence of an incomplete but parasitic fetus located in the body of its twin. This tumor is considered benign (non-cancerous) but life-threatening because of its atypical features (size, location, and rate of development) and high risk of airway obstruction, which is the cause of death in 80-100% of the cases at the time of delivery.
Despite the high mortality rate, the most important factor in improving survival probability is to detect and diagnose the lesion before birth using ultrasound and MRI scans."
Myeloproliferative Disorders,"Headache, dizziness, excessive sweating, fatigue, weight loss, decreased appetite, pain in the upper left abdomen","Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of rare blood cancers in which excess red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets are produced in the bone marrow.  Myelo refers to the bone marrow, proliferative describes the rapid growth of blood cells and neoplasm describes that growth as abnormal and uncontrolled.
The overproduction of blood cells is often associated with a somatic mutation, for example in the JAK2, CALR, TET2, and MPL gene markers.
In rare cases, some MPNs such as primary myelofibrosis may accelerate and turn into acute myeloid leukemia.


== Classification ==
MPNs are classified as blood cancers by most institutions and organizations."
Melioidosis,"Consolidation, abdominal pain, diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly, high fever, chills, jaundice, myalgia","Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by a gram-negative bacterium called Burkholderia pseudomallei.  Most people exposed to B. pseudomallei experience no symptoms, but complications can range from fever and skin changes to pneumonia, abscesses, and septic shock, which can be fatal. Approximately 10% of people with melioidosis develop symptoms that last longer than two months, termed ""chronic melioidosis"".
Humans are infected with B. pseudomallei by contact with contaminated soil or water. The bacteria enter the body through wounds, inhalation, or ingestion."
Osteolytic Lesions,"Pain, functional impairment, bone destruction, elevated local temperature","An osteolytic lesion (from the Greek words for ""bone"" (), and ""to unbind"" ()) is a softened section of a patient's bone formed as a symptom of specific diseases, including breast cancer and multiple myeloma. This softened area appears as a hole on X-ray scans due to decreased bone density, although many other diseases are associated with this symptom. Osteolytic lesions can cause pain, increased risk of bone fracture, and spinal cord compression. These lesions can be treated using bisphosphonates or radiation, though new solutions are being tested in clinical trials.


== Cellular causes ==
Bone lesions are caused by an imbalance of regulatory factors, characterized by an increased depletion and resorption of old bone tissue and a decrease in bone rebuilding, known as bone remodeling."
Primary Cardiac Tumors,"Hemoptysis, arrhythmia, increased pulmonary fluid content, nausea and vomiting, shock, palpitations, coma, heart failure, syncope, chest tightness, dyspnea, jugular venous distention","Primary tumors of the heart are extremely rare tumors that arise from the normal tissues that make up the heart. The incidence of primary cardiac tumors has been found to be approximately 0.02%. This is in contrast to secondary tumors of the heart, which are typically either metastatic from another part of the body, or infiltrate the heart via direct extension from the surrounding tissues. Metastatic tumors to the heart are about 20 times more common than primary cardiac tumors.


== Types ==


=== Benign ===
The most common primary tumor of the heart is the myxoma."
Head Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"Papules, nodules, ulcers, scales","Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (cSCC), also known as squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous-cell skin cancer, is one of the three principal types of skin cancer, alongside basal-cell carcinoma and melanoma. cSCC typically presents as a hard lump with a scaly surface, though it may also present as an ulcer. Onset and development often occurs over several months.
Compared to basal cell carcinoma, cSCC  is more likely to spread to distant areas. When confined to the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin, the pre-invasive or in situ form of cSCC is termed Bowen's disease."

Severe Nosocomial Pneumonia,"Fever, chest pain, cough, expectoration, dyspnea, rales, purulent sputum, consciousness disorder, pulmonary infection","Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or nosocomial pneumonia refers to any pneumonia contracted by a patient in a hospital at least 4872 hours after being admitted. It is thus distinguished from community-acquired pneumonia. It is usually caused by a bacterial infection, rather than a virus.
Hospital acquired pneumonia is the second most common nosocomial infection (after urinary tract infections) and accounts for 1520% of the total. It is the most common cause of death among nosocomial infections and is the primary cause of death in intensive care units."
Ventricular Escape Beats and Ventricular Escape Rhythm,"Bradycardia, chest tightness, dizziness, fatigue, irregular heartbeat, chest pain, vertigo, syncope, ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest, shock, arrhythmia","In cardiology, a ventricular escape beat is a self-generated electrical discharge initiated by, and causing contraction of the ventricles of the heart; normally the heart rhythm is begun in the atria of the heart and is subsequently transmitted to the ventricles. The ventricular escape beat follows a long pause in ventricular rhythm and acts to prevent cardiac arrest. It indicates a failure of the electrical conduction system of the heart to stimulate the ventricles (which would lead to the absence of heartbeats, unless ventricular escape beats occur).


== Causes ==
Ventricular escape beats occur when the rate of electrical discharge reaching the ventricles (normally initiated by the heart's sinoatrial node (SA node), transmitted to the atrioventricular node (AV node), and then further transmitted to the ventricles) falls below the base rate determined by the rate of Phase 4 spontaneous depolarisation of ventricular pacemaker cells.
An escape beat usually occurs 23 seconds after an electrical impulse has failed to reach the ventricles."
Ventricular Asystole,"Loss of consciousness, absence of heart sounds, syncope, chest pain","Asystole (New Latin, from Greek privative a ""not, without"" + systol ""contraction"") is the absence of ventricular contractions in the context of a lethal heart arrhythmia (in contrast to an induced asystole on a cooled patient on a heart-lung machine and general anesthesia during surgery necessitating stopping the heart). Asystole is the most serious form of cardiac arrest and is usually irreversible. Also referred to as cardiac flatline, asystole is the state of total cessation of electrical activity from the heart, which means no tissue contraction from the heart muscle and therefore no blood flow to the rest of the body.
Asystole should not be confused with very brief pauses below 3 seconds in the heart's electrical activity that can occur in certain less severe abnormal rhythms. Asystole is different from very fine occurrences of ventricular fibrillation, though both have a poor prognosis, and untreated fine VF will lead to asystole."
Omental Torsion,"Gradually worsening right-sided abdominal pain, accompanied by anorexia, nausea, fever, nausea and vomiting, abdominal mass, abdominal pain, right lower abdominal tenderness, and abdominal muscle tension","Omental infarction, or omental torsion, is an acute vascular disorder which compromises tissue of the greater omentumthe largest peritoneal fold in the abdomen.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Patients will present with a sudden onset of cramps/abdominal pain or a 'stitch'. The pain localises in the area of the umbilicus and can radiate to the lumbar and surrounding regions.


== Causes ==
Omental infarction is a rare cause of acute abdomen pain with reported incidence being less than 4 per 1000 cases of appendicitis. Omental infarction usually presents as right-sided abdominal pain although seldom causing left-sided abdominal pain and even epigastric pain."
Acute Intracerebral Hematoma,"Headache, nausea, vomiting","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), also known as hemorrhagic stroke, is a sudden bleeding into the tissues of the brain (i.e. the parenchyma), into its ventricles, or into both. An ICH is a type of bleeding within the skull and one kind of stroke (ischemic stroke being the other). Symptoms can vary dramatically depending on the severity (how much blood), acuity (over what timeframe), and location (anatomically) but can include headache, one-sided weakness, numbness, tingling, or paralysis, speech problems, vision or hearing problems, memory loss, attention problems, coordination problems, balance problems, dizziness or lightheadedness or vertigo, nausea/vomiting, seizures, decreased level of consciousness or total loss of consciousness, neck stiffness, and fever.
Hemorrhagic stroke may occur on the background of alterations to the blood vessels in the brain, such as cerebral arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral arteriovenous malformation, brain trauma, brain tumors and an intracranial aneurysm, which can cause intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage."
Osteoma,"Proptosis, dizziness, headache","An osteoma (plural osteomas or less commonly osteomata) is a new piece of bone usually growing as a benign tumour on another piece of bone, typically the skull. When grown on other bone it is known as ""homoplastic osteoma""; on other tissue it is called ""heteroplastic osteoma"".
Osteoma represents the most common benign neoplasm of the nose and paranasal sinuses. The cause of osteomas is uncertain, but commonly accepted theories propose embryologic, traumatic, or infectious causes. They are present in Gardner's syndrome."
Colonic Polyps,"Abdominal pain, tenesmus, hematochezia, mucus in stool, constipation, colonic polyps, and intussusception","A colorectal polyp is a polyp (fleshy growth) occurring on the lining of the colon or rectum. Untreated colorectal polyps can develop into colorectal cancer.
Colorectal polyps are often classified by their behaviour (i.e. benign vs. malignant) or cause (e.g."
Breast Ductal Adenoma,"Nipple discharge of serous or bloody fluid, intermittent or continuous, increased volume during menstruation, palpable small round masses near the nipple, soft, non-adherent to the skin, movable","Breast cancer classification divides breast cancer into categories according to different schemes criteria and serving a different purpose. The major categories are the histopathological type, the grade of the tumor, the stage of the tumor, and the expression of proteins and genes. As knowledge of cancer cell biology develops these classifications are updated.
The purpose of classification is to select the best treatment. The effectiveness of a specific treatment is demonstrated for a specific breast cancer (usually by randomized, controlled trials)."
Carbamate Pesticide Poisoning,"Dizziness, drooling, nausea and vomiting, headache, coma, urinary and fecal incontinence, confusion, fatigue","Carbamate poisoning is poisoning due to exposure to carbamates, which are commonly sold as pesticides around the world. In most respects, it is similar to organophosphate poisoning, though typically less severe or requiring a larger amount of the chemical before symptoms appear.


== Symptoms ==
The array of symptoms typically seen in carbamate poisoning include both muscarinic and nicotinic symptoms. Muscarinic receptor effects include:

Bradycardia, or reduced heart rate
Bronchospasm, or tightening of the bronchioles of the lungs
Miosis, or constriction of the pupils
Vomiting and abdominal pain
Diarrhea
Excessive sweating and salivation
Bronchospasm is a potential life threat, especially when combined with nicotinic effects on the respiratory muscles. Bradycardia can be life-threatening in people with preexisting heart conditions."
Lacunar Stroke in the Elderly,"Headache, dizziness, limb numbness, memory impairment, slow reaction, convulsions, dementia, sensory disturbances, pyramidal tract lesions, visual field defects, apraxia, diplopia","Lacunar stroke or lacunar cerebral infarct (LACI) is the most common type of ischemic stroke, resulting from the occlusion of small penetrating arteries that provide blood to the brain's deep structures. Patients who present with symptoms of a lacunar stroke, but who have not yet had diagnostic imaging performed, may be described as having lacunar stroke syndrome (LACS).
Much of the current knowledge of lacunar strokes comes from C. Miller Fisher's cadaver dissections of post-mortem stroke patients. He observed ""lacunae"" (empty spaces) in the deep brain structures after occlusion of 200800 m penetrating arteries and connected them with five classic syndromes. These syndromes are still noted today, though lacunar infarcts are diagnosed based on clinical judgment and radiologic imaging."
Pneumothorax,"Chest tightness, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, chest pain","A pneumothorax is collection of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. In a minority of cases, a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, and the amount of air in the space between chest wall and lungs increases; this is called a tension pneumothorax. This can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. This leads to a type of shock called obstructive shock, which can be fatal unless reversed."
Ovarian Yolk Sac Tumor,"Abdominal pain, abdominal mass, bloating, fever","Ovarian germ cell tumors (OGCTs) are heterogeneous tumors that are derived from the primitive germ cells of the embryonic gonad, which accounts for about 2.6% of all ovarian malignancies. There are four main types of OGCTs, namely dysgerminomas, yolk sac tumor, teratoma, and choriocarcinoma.
Dygerminomas are Malignant germ cell tumor of ovary and particularly prominent in patients diagnosed with gonadal dysgenesis. OGCTs are relatively difficult to detect and diagnose at an early stage because of the nonspecific histological characteristics. Common symptoms of OGCT are bloating, abdominal distention, ascites, and dyspareunia."
Malignant Blue Nevus,"Nodules, ulcers","A blue nevus is a type of coloured mole, typically a  single well-defined blue-black bump. 
The blue colour is caused by the pigment being deep in the skin.
Diagnosis is by visualisation and dermoscopy. A biopsy is sometimes performed, or the whole lesion surgically removed. The outcome is generally good but there is a small chance of cancerous transformation."
Pneumococcal Sepsis,"Chills, high fever, headache, body ache, somnolence, sepsis, fever, meningitis, respiratory distress, recurrent pneumonia, cough, respiratory failure","Pneumococcal infection is an infection caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. 
S. pneumoniae is a common member of the bacterial flora colonizing the nose and throat of 510% of healthy adults and 2040% of healthy children. However, it is also a cause of significant disease, being a leading cause of pneumonia, bacterial meningitis, and sepsis. The World Health Organization estimates that in 2005, pneumococcal infections were responsible for the death of 1.6 million children worldwide.


== Infections ==

Pneumococcal pneumonia represents 15%50% of all episodes of community-acquired pneumonia, 3050% of all cases of acute otitis media, and a significant proportion of bloodstream infections and bacterial meningitis."
Hypertensive Heart Disease,"Headache, chest tightness, blurred vision, feeling of light-headedness","Hypertensive heart disease includes a number of complications of high blood pressure that affect the heart. While there are several definitions of hypertensive heart disease in the medical literature, the term is most widely used in the context of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding categories. The definition includes heart failure and other cardiac complications of hypertension when a causal relationship between the heart disease and hypertension is stated or implied on the death certificate. In 2013 hypertensive heart disease resulted in 1.07 million deaths as compared with 630,000 deaths in 1990.
According to ICD-10, hypertensive heart disease (I11), and its subcategories: hypertensive heart disease with heart failure (I11.0) and hypertensive heart disease without heart failure (I11.9) are distinguished from chronic rheumatic heart diseases (I05-I09),  other forms of heart disease (I30-I52) and ischemic heart diseases (I20-I25)."
Protein-Energy Malnutrition (PEM),"Decreased muscle strength, emaciation, underweight","Proteinenergy undernutrition (PEU), once called proteinenergy malnutrition (PEM), is a form of malnutrition that is defined as a range of conditions arising from coincident lack of dietary protein and/or energy (calories) in varying proportions. The condition has mild, moderate, and severe degrees.

Types include:

Kwashiorkor (protein malnutrition predominant)
Marasmus (deficiency in calorie intake)
Marasmic kwashiorkor (marked protein deficiency and marked calorie insufficiency signs present, sometimes referred to as the most severe form of malnutrition)
PEU is fairly common worldwide in both children and adults and accounts for about 250,000 deaths annually. In the industrialized world, PEM is predominantly seen in hospitals, is associated with disease, or is often found in the elderly.
Note that PEU may be secondary to other conditions such as chronic renal disease or cancer cachexia in which protein energy wasting (PEW) may occur."
Heatstroke and Heat Stress in Children,"Sudden rise in body temperature, profuse sweating, dehydration, irritability and drowsiness","Heat stroke or heatstroke, also known as sun-stroke, is a severe heat illness that results in a body temperature greater than 40.0 C (104.0 F), along with red skin, headache, dizziness, and confusion. Sweating is generally present in exertional heatstroke, but not in classic heatstroke. The start of heat stroke can be sudden or gradual. Heatstroke is a life-threatening condition due to the potential for multi-organ dysfunction, with typical complications including seizures, rhabdomyolysis, or kidney failure.
Heat stroke occurs because of high external temperatures and/or physical exertion."
Hepatitis A,"Pain in the liver area, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, fatigue, loss of appetite, decreased appetite, aversion to oily food, jaundice","Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue. Some people or animals with hepatitis have no symptoms, whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hepatitis is acute if it resolves within six months, and chronic if it lasts longer than six months. Acute hepatitis can resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or (rarely) result in acute liver failure. Chronic hepatitis may progress to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer."
Cerebral Infarction,"Unsteady gait, urinary and fecal incontinence, localization signs, arteriosclerosis, abducens nerve palsy, lenticulostriate artery occlusion, nausea, diplopia","Cerebral infarction, also known as an ischemic stroke, is the pathologic process that results in an area of necrotic tissue in the brain (cerebral infarct).  In mid to high income countries, a stroke is the main reason for disability among people and the 2nd cause of death. It is caused by disrupted blood supply (ischemia) and restricted oxygen supply (hypoxia). This is most commonly due to a thrombotic occlusion, or an embolic occlusion of major vessels which leads to a cerebral infarct . In response to ischemia, the brain degenerates by the process of liquefactive necrosis."
Postpartum Disorders,"Irritability, terror, anxiety, depression, and excessive worry about one's own and the baby's health","A postpartum disorder or puerperal disorder is a disease or condition which presents primarily during the days and weeks after childbirth called the postpartum period. The postpartum period can be divided into three distinct stages: the initial or acute phase, 612 hours after childbirth; subacute postpartum period, which lasts two to six weeks, and the delayed postpartum period, which can last up to six months. In the subacute postpartum period, 87% to 94% of women report at least one health problem. Long term health problems (persisting after the delayed postpartum period) are reported by 31% of women.
The World Health Organization (WHO) describes the postpartum period as the most critical and yet the most neglected phase in the lives of mothers and babies; most maternal and newborn deaths occur during the postpartum period."
Oropharyngeal Cancer,"Throat pain, difficulty opening mouth, blood-tinged saliva, bad breath, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, difficulty speaking","Oropharyngeal cancer, also known as oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and tonsil cancer, is a disease in which abnormal cells with the potential to both grow locally and spread to other parts of the body are found in the oral cavity, in the tissue of the part of the throat (oropharynx) that includes the base of the tongue, the tonsils, the soft palate, and the walls of the pharynx.
The two types of oropharyngeal cancers are HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, which is caused by an oral human papillomavirus infection; and HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer, which is linked to use of alcohol, tobacco, or both.
Oropharyngeal cancer is diagnosed by biopsy of observed abnormal tissue in the throat. Oropharyngeal cancer  is staged according to the appearance of the abnormal cells on the biopsy coupled with the dimensions and the extent of the abnormal cells found. Treatment is with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy; or some combination of those treatments."
Pediatric Hepatitis B Virus-Related Nephritis,"Edema, hematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, decreased glomerular filtration rate, abnormal elevation of transaminases, hepatomegaly, positive hepatitis B e antibody (anti-HBe), HBsAg-positive, HBeAg-positive, yellowing of the lips, elevated transaminases","Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue. Some people or animals with hepatitis have no symptoms, whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hepatitis is acute if it resolves within six months, and chronic if it lasts longer than six months. Acute hepatitis can resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or (rarely) result in acute liver failure. Chronic hepatitis may progress to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer."
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML),"Increased white blood cells, sternal tenderness, vision disorders, splenomegaly, anemia, limb weakness, cachexia, hepatomegaly, fatigue, weight loss, low fever, fever","Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), also known as chronic myeloid leukemia, is a cancer of the white blood cells. It is a form of leukemia characterized by the increased and unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of these cells in the blood. CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) and their precursors is found; characteristic increase in basophils is clinically relevant. It is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome.
CML is largely treated with targeted drugs called tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which have led to dramatically improved long-term survival rates since 2001."
Pediatric Intraspinal Tumor,"Neuralgia, sensory disturbances, urinary and fecal incontinence, formication, delayed sensation, decreased muscle tone, muscle atrophy, anal relaxation, weakness of the lower limbs, unstable gait, meningitis, scoliosis","A brain tumor (sometimes referred more commonly as brain cancer) occurs when a group of cells within the brain turn cancerous and grow out of control, creating a mass. There are two main types of tumors: malignant (cancerous) tumors and benign (non-cancerous) tumors. These can be further classified as primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which most commonly have spread from tumors located outside the brain, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the size of the tumor and the part of the brain that is involved. Where symptoms exist, they may include headaches, seizures, problems with vision, vomiting and mental changes."
Hepatic Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma,"Cachexia, hepatomegaly, jaundice, splenomegaly, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, anorexia","Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE) is a rare tumor, first characterized by Sharon Weiss and Franz Enzinger in 1982 that both clinically and histologically is intermediate between angiosarcoma and hemangioma. However, a distinct, disease-defining genetic alteration recently described for EHE indicates that it is an entirely separate entity from both angiosarcoma and hemangioma.
EHE is a soft tissue sarcoma and is generally considered a vascular cancer insofar as the lesional cells have surface markers typical of endothelial cells (cells lining the interior of blood vessels). EHE was originally described as occurring most commonly in the veins of the extremities (arms and legs) and two organs, the liver and lungs. It has since been described in organs throughout the body."
Ectopic Tubal Pregnancy,"Acute abdominal pain, short-term amenorrhea, irregular spotting or vaginal bleeding, tenderness and enlargement of the affected fallopian tube, dizziness, blurred vision, cold sweats, palpitations","Ectopic pregnancy is a complication of pregnancy in which the embryo attaches outside the uterus. Signs and symptoms classically include abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding, but fewer than 50 percent of affected women have both of these symptoms. The pain may be described as sharp, dull, or crampy. Pain may also spread to the shoulder if bleeding into the abdomen has occurred. Severe bleeding may result in a fast heart rate, fainting, or shock."
Paraneoplastic Limbic Encephalitis,"Progressive dementia, memory impairment, myoclonus, partial loss of speech function, epileptic and epileptiform seizures, cerebellar signs, anxiety, hallucinations","Limbic encephalitis is a form of encephalitis, a disease characterized by inflammation of the brain. Limbic encephalitis is caused by autoimmunity: an abnormal state where the body produces antibodies against itself. Some cases are associated with cancer and some are not. Although the disease is known as ""limbic"" encephalitis, it is seldom limited to the limbic system and post-mortem studies usually show involvement of other parts of the brain. The disease was first described by Brierley and others in 1960 as a series of three cases."
Cervical Spine Fracture and Dislocation,"Paralysis, cervical spine fracture and dislocation, neck pain, tenderness","A cervical fracture, commonly called a broken neck, is a fracture of any of the seven cervical vertebrae in the neck. Examples of common causes in humans are traffic collisions and diving into shallow water. Abnormal movement of neck bones or pieces of bone can cause a spinal cord injury, resulting in loss of sensation, paralysis, or usually death soon thereafter (~1 min.), primarily via compromising neurological supply to the respiratory muscles and innervation to the heart.


== Causes ==

Considerable force is needed to cause a cervical fracture. Vehicle collisions and falls are common causes."
Anal Cancer,"Anal bleeding, anal obstruction, perianal abscess","Oral cancer, also known as oral cavity cancer, tongue cancer or mouth cancer, is a cancer of the lining of the lips, mouth, or upper throat. In the mouth, it most commonly starts as a painless red or white patch, that thickens, gets ulcerated and continues to grow. When on the lips, it commonly looks like a persistent crusting ulcer that does not heal, and slowly grows. Other symptoms may include difficult or painful swallowing, new lumps or bumps in the neck, a swelling in the mouth, or a feeling of numbness in the mouth or lips.
Risk factors include tobacco and alcohol use."
Intervertebral Disc Calcification,"Low-grade fever, fatigue, calcification, neck pain, spinous process tenderness, and a foreign body sensation in the throat","An intervertebral disc (British English), also spelled intervertebral disk (American English), lies between adjacent vertebrae in the vertebral column. Each disc forms a fibrocartilaginous joint (a symphysis), to allow slight movement of the vertebrae, to act as a ligament to hold the vertebrae together, and to function as a shock absorber for the spine.


== Structure ==

Intervertebral discs consist of an outer fibrous ring, the anulus (or annulus) fibrosus disci intervertebralis, which surrounds an inner gel-like center, the nucleus pulposus. 
The anulus fibrosus consists of several layers (laminae) of fibrocartilage made up of both type I and type II collagen. Type I is concentrated toward the edge of the ring, where it provides greater strength."
Poliomyelitis,"General muscle and skeletal pain, skin hypersensitivity, somnolence, disappearance of tendon reflexes, muscle atrophy, muscle pain, cramps","Poliomyelitis ( POH-lee-oh-MY--LY-tiss), commonly shortened to polio, is an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus. Approximately 75% of cases are asymptomatic; mild symptoms which can occur include sore throat and fever; in a proportion of cases more severe symptoms develop such as headache, neck stiffness, and paresthesia. These symptoms usually pass within one or two weeks. A less common symptom is permanent paralysis, and possible death in extreme cases. Years after recovery, post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to what the person had during the initial infection."
Botulism,"Headache, nausea and vomiting, diplopia, dizziness, abnormal pupils, cyanosis of the skin and mucous membranes, eye pain, abnormal defecation frequency, paralysis, swallowing difficulties, sore throat, and 'pseudo paralysis' of the shoulder girdle","Botulism is a rare and potentially fatal illness caused by botulinum toxin, which is produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The disease begins with weakness, blurred vision, feeling tired, and trouble speaking. This may then be followed by weakness of the arms, chest muscles, and legs. Vomiting, swelling of the abdomen, and diarrhea may also occur. The disease does not usually affect consciousness or cause a fever."
Vaginal Endodermal Sinus Tumor,"Painless abnormal vaginal bleeding, blood-stained diapers or vaginal discharge","Endodermal sinus tumor (EST) is a member of the germ cell tumor group of cancers. It is the most common testicular tumor in children under three, and is also known as infantile embryonal carcinoma and yolk sac tumor. This age group has a very good prognosis. In contrast to the pure form typical of infants, adult endodermal sinus tumors are often found in combination with other kinds of germ cell tumor, particularly teratoma and embryonal carcinoma. While pure teratoma is usually benign, endodermal sinus tumor is malignant."
Pediatric Septic Shock,"Clouded consciousness, fever, palpitations, prostration, listlessness, pallor, cyanosis","Septic shock is a potentially fatal medical condition that occurs when sepsis, which is organ injury or damage in response to infection, leads to dangerously low blood pressure and abnormalities in cellular metabolism. The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) defines septic shock as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Patients with septic shock can be clinically identified by requiring a vasopressor to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and having serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (>18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia. This combination is associated with hospital mortality rates greater than 40%.
The primary infection is most commonly caused by bacteria, but also may be by fungi, viruses or parasites."
Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis (CVST),"Irregular fever with chills, general malaise and muscle pain, weakness, weight loss, headaches, vomiting, seizures, disturbances in consciousness, difficulty swallowing, coughing when drinking water, unclear articulation","Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis or cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), is the presence of a blood clot in the dural venous sinuses (which drain blood from the brain), the cerebral veins, or both. Symptoms may include severe headache, visual symptoms, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs on one side of the body, and seizures, which occur in around 40% of patients.
The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses. After confirmation of the diagnosis, investigations may be performed to determine the underlying cause, especially if one is not readily apparent.
Treatment is typically with anticoagulants (medications that suppress blood clotting) such as low molecular weight heparin."
Pediatric Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma,"Emaciation, lymphadenopathy, limb pain, tendency to bleed, hepatosplenomegaly, facial and upper limb edema","Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), also known as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, is a group of blood cancers that includes all types of lymphomas except Hodgkin lymphomas. Symptoms include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and tiredness. Other symptoms may include bone pain, chest pain, or itchiness. Some forms are slow-growing while others are fast-growing. Unlike Hodgkin lymphoma, which spreads contiguously, NHL is largely a systemic illness."
Rift Valley Fever,"High fever, bradycardia, myalgia, severe headache, photophobia, skin and mucosal bleeding, retinal detachment","Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral disease of humans and livestock that can cause mild to severe symptoms. The mild symptoms may include: fever, muscle pains, and headaches which often last for up to a week. The severe symptoms may include: loss of sight beginning three weeks after the infection, infections of the brain causing severe headaches and confusion, and bleeding together with liver problems which may occur within the first few days. Those who have bleeding have a chance of death as high as 50%.
The disease is caused by the RVF virus."
Myocardial Ischemia,"Electrocardiogram abnormalities, angina, myocardial infarction","Coronary artery disease (CAD), also called coronary heart disease (CHD), or ischemic heart disease (IHD), is a type of heart disease involving the reduction of blood flow to the cardiac muscle due to a build-up of atheromatous plaque in the arteries of the heart. It is the most common of the cardiovascular diseases. CAD can cause stable angina, unstable angina, myocardial ischemia, and myocardial infarction.
A common symptom is angina, which is chest pain or discomfort that may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Occasionally it may feel like heartburn."
Respiratory Muscle Fatigue Syndrome,"Shortness of breath, abnormal breathing, abnormal breath","GuillainBarr syndrome (GBS) is a rapid-onset muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system. Typically, both sides of the body are involved, and the initial symptoms are changes in sensation or pain often in the back along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands, often spreading to the arms and upper body. The symptoms may develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening, with about 15% of people developing respiratory muscle weakness requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in the function of the autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure."
Oral Leukoplakia,"Inflammatory cell infiltration, pale and swollen tongue, root of the tongue abscess, white patches, erosion, pain","Oral leukoplakia is a potentially malignant disorder affecting the oral mucosa. It is defined as ""essentially an oral mucosal white/gray lesion that cannot be considered as any other definable lesion."" Oral leukoplakia is a gray patch or plaque that develops in the oral cavity and is strongly associated with smoking. Leukoplakia is a firmly attached white patch on a mucous membrane which is associated with increased risk of cancer. The edges of the lesion are typically abrupt and the lesion changes with time. Advanced forms may develop red patches."
Malignant Pleural Effusion,"Dyspnea, chest pain, dry cough, chest tightness, weight loss, shortness of breath, orthopnea, cyanosis, cough, cachexia, fatigue, anemia","Malignant pleural effusion is a condition in which cancer causes an abnormal amount of fluid to collect between the thin layers of tissue (pleura) lining the outside of the lung and the wall of the chest cavity. Lung cancer and breast cancer account for about 50-65% of malignant pleural effusions.  Other common causes include pleural mesothelioma and lymphoma.


== Diagnosis ==


=== Clinical evaluation ===
Clinical factors predicting the diagnosis of malignant pleural effusions are symptoms lasting more than 1 month and the absence of fever.


=== Imaging ===
Imaging is needed to confirm the presence of a pleural effusion."
Acute Glomerulonephritis,"Proteinuria, hypertension, oliguria, azotemia, hematuria with proteinuria, edema, eyelid swelling, anuria, fatigue, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, dizziness","Acute proliferative glomerulonephritis is a disorder of the small blood vessels of the kidney. It is a common complication of bacterial infections, typically skin infection by Streptococcus bacteria types 12, 4 and 1 (impetigo) but also after streptococcal pharyngitis, for which it is also known as postinfectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN) or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). It can be a risk factor for future albuminuria. In adults, the signs and symptoms of infection may still be present at the time when the kidney problems develop, and the terms infection-related glomerulonephritis or bacterial infection-related glomerulonephritis are also used. Acute glomerulonephritis resulted in 19,000 deaths in 2013, down from 24,000 deaths in 1990 worldwide."
Hemothorax and Pneumothorax,"History of chest trauma, often accompanied by rib fractures, sharp chest pain, chest tightness, shortness of breath or even difficulty breathing, significant blood loss can lead to hypovolemic shock symptoms","A hemothorax (derived from hemo- [blood] + thorax [chest], plural hemothoraces) is an accumulation of blood within the pleural cavity. The symptoms of a hemothorax may include chest pain and difficulty breathing, while the clinical signs may include reduced breath sounds on the affected side and a rapid heart rate. Hemothoraces are usually caused by an injury, but they may occur spontaneously due to cancer invading the pleural cavity, as a result of a blood clotting disorder, as an unusual manifestation of endometriosis, in response to pneumothorax, or rarely in association with other conditions.
Hemothoraces are usually diagnosed using a chest X-ray, but they can be identified using other forms of imaging including ultrasound, a CT scan, or an MRI. They can be differentiated from other forms of fluid within the pleural cavity by analysing a sample of the fluid, and are defined as having a hematocrit of greater than 50% that of the person's blood. Hemothoraces may be treated by draining the blood using a chest tube."
Malignant Meningioma,"Headache, epilepsy and epileptic seizures, hemiplegia","Malignant meningioma is a rare, fast-growing tumor that forms in one of the inner layers of the meninges (thin layers of tissue that cover and protect the brain and spinal cord). Malignant meningioma often spreads to other areas of the body.
The World Health Organization classification system defines both grade II and grade III meningiomas as malignant.  Historically, histological subtypes have also been used in classification including:

clear cell (WHO grade II),
chordoid (WHO grade II),
rhabdoid (WHO grade III), and
papillary (WHO grade III)
Benign or low grade meningiomas (WHO grade I) include meningothelial, fibrous, transitional, psammomatous, angiomatous, microcystic, secretory, lymphoplasmacyte-rich, and metaplastic.

Pancreatic Diseases,"Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, chest and back pain","Pancreatic diseases are diseases that affect the pancreas, an organ in most vertebrates and in humans and other mammals located in the abdomen. The pancreas plays a role in the digestive and endocrine system, producing enzymes which aid the digestion process and the hormone insulin, which regulates blood sugar levels. The most common pancreatic disease is pancreatitis, an inflammation of the pancreas which could come in acute or chronic form. Other pancreatic diseases include diabetes mellitus, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, cystic fibrosis, pseudocysts, cysts, congenital malformations, tumors including pancreatic cancer, and hemosuccus pancreaticus.


== Pancreatitis ==
Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas."
Single-Infarct Dementia,"Hemiplegia, pyramidal tract lesion, sensory disturbance, cognitive dysfunction, urinary and fecal incontinence, somnolence, behavioral and emotional abnormalities, dementia, forgetfulness, alexia, visual agnosia, cerebral edema","Vascular dementia is dementia caused by a series of strokes. Restricted blood flow due to strokes reduces oxygen and glucose delivery to the brain, causing cell injury and neurological deficits in the affected region. Subtypes of vascular dementia include subcortical vascular dementia, multi-infarct dementia, stroke-related dementia, and mixed dementia.
Subcortical vascular dementia occurs from damage to small blood vessels in the brain. Multi-infarct dementia results from a series of small strokes affecting several brain regions."
Renal Tuberculosis,"Painless hematuria, frequent urination, dysuria, urgency to urinate, low fever, night sweats, hematuria, and pyuria","Urogenital tuberculosis, the second most frequent form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, develops in 2-20% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis through hematogenous spread to the kidneys, prostate, and epididymis. The disease follows a descending pattern, spreading through the collecting system to the ureters, bladder, and urethra, and through the ejaculatory ducts to the male sex organs. Though most prevalent in males in their fourth and fifth decades, it can occur at any age and in both males and females.
Characterized by its slow, gradual progression, urogenital tuberculosis often remains without symptoms until reaching advanced stages, frequently resulting in diagnostic delays and significant urogenital organ destruction. The condition's serious but insidious nature is evidenced by cases where renal failure constitutes the initial clinical presentation."
Group A Streptococcal Infection,"Fever, sore throat, headache, pustules, shock, wound infection, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, persistent fever, tonsillar congestion, edema, debilitation","Group A streptococcal infections are a number of infections with Streptococcus pyogenes, a group A streptococcus (GAS). S. pyogenes is a species of beta-hemolytic Gram-positive bacteria that is responsible for a wide range of infections that are mostly common and fairly mild. If the bacteria enters the bloodstream, the infection can become severe and life-threatening, and is called an invasive GAS (iGAS).
Infection of GAS may spread through direct contact with mucus or sores on the skin. GAS infections can cause over 500,000 deaths per year."
Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis (PSGN),"Headache, sore throat, skin infection, eyelid swelling, hypertension, proteinuria, hematuria","Acute proliferative glomerulonephritis is a disorder of the small blood vessels of the kidney. It is a common complication of bacterial infections, typically skin infection by Streptococcus bacteria types 12, 4 and 1 (impetigo) but also after streptococcal pharyngitis, for which it is also known as postinfectious glomerulonephritis (PIGN) or poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN). It can be a risk factor for future albuminuria.

Acute glomerulonephritis resulted in 19,000 deaths in 2013, down from 24,000 deaths in 1990 worldwide."
Bacillary Angiomatosis,"Sepsis, periostitis, HIV infection, bacteremia, papules, osteolytic lesions, granuloma, gastrointestinal symptoms","Bacillary angiomatosis (BA) is a form of angiomatosis associated with bacteria of the genus Bartonella.


== Symptoms ==
Cutaneous BA is characterised by the presence of lesions on or under the skin. Appearing in numbers from one to hundreds, these lesions may take several forms:

papules or nodules which are red, globular and non-blanching, with a vascular appearance
purplish nodules sufficiently similar to Kaposi's sarcoma that a biopsy may be required to verify which of the two it is
a purplish lichenoid plaque
a subcutaneous nodule which may have ulceration, similar to a bacterial abscess
While cutaneous BA is the most common form, it can also affect several other parts of the body, such as the brain, bone, bone marrow, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, spleen, and liver. Symptoms vary depending on which parts of the body are affected; for example, those whose livers are affected may have an enlarged liver and fever, while those with osseous BA  experience intense pain in the affected area.


=== Presentation ===
BA is characterised by the proliferation of blood vessels, resulting in them forming tumour-like masses in the skin and other organs."
Closed Head Injury,"Disturbance of consciousness, scalp injuries, bleeding or leakage from ears and nose, unequal pupil size, abnormal light reflex, abnormal motor and tendon reflexes","Closed-head injury is a type of traumatic brain injury in which the skull and dura mater remain intact. Closed-head injuries are the leading cause of death in children under 4 years old and the most common cause of physical disability and cognitive impairment in young people. Overall, closed-head injuries and other forms of mild traumatic brain injury account for about 75% of the estimated 1.7 million brain injuries that occur annually in the United States. Brain injuries such as closed-head injuries may result in lifelong physical, cognitive, or psychological impairment and, thus, are of utmost concern with regards to public health.


== Symptoms ==
If symptoms of a head injury are seen after an accident, medical care is necessary to diagnose and treat the injury."
Ocular Perforation,"Corneal perforation, Sclerocorneal perforation, Scleral perforation, Ocular penetration injury","Blast-related ocular trauma comprises a specialized subgroup blast injuries which cause penetrating and blunt force injuries to the eye and its structure. The incidence of ocular trauma due to blast forces has increased dramatically with the introduction of new explosives technology into modern warfare. The availability of these volatile materials, coupled with the tactics of contemporary terrorism, has caused a rise in the number of homemade bombs capable of extreme physical harm.


== Military classification of improvised explosive devices ==
The United States Department of Defense classifies IEDs as explosive machines that are constructed exclusively (i.e., without mass production) and result in the direct physical harm of surrounding individuals. The use of these bombs by insurgents has been the number one cause of death and injury among Coalition soldiers since the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom in April 2003."
Permanent Atrial Fibrillation,"Palpitations, chest tightness, difficulty breathing","Atrial fibrillation (AF, AFib or A-fib) is an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) characterized by rapid and irregular beating of the atrial chambers of the heart. It often begins as short periods of abnormal beating, which become longer or continuous over time.  It may also start as other forms of arrhythmia such as atrial flutter that then transform into AF.
Episodes can be asymptomatic. Symptomatic episodes may involve heart palpitations, fainting, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, or shortness of breath. Atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, dementia, and stroke."
Atrial Myocardial Infarction,"Thrombotic vegetations, arrhythmias, microthrombus formation, palpitations, shortness of breath, myocardial infarction","Myocardial infarction complications may occur immediately following a myocardial infarction (heart attack) (in the acute phase), or may need time to develop (a chronic problem). After an infarction, an obvious complication is a second infarction, which may occur in the domain of another atherosclerotic coronary artery, or in the same zone if there are any live cells left in the infarct.

Post-myocardial complications occur after a period of ischemia, these changes can be seen in gross tissue changes and microscopic changes. Necrosis begins after 20 minutes of an infarction.  Under 4 hours of ischemia, there are no gross or microscopic changes noted."
Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC),"Microcirculation disorders, bleeding, hemolysis, acrocyanosis, cyanosis, oliguria, hypotension","Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a condition in which blood clots form throughout the body, blocking small blood vessels. Symptoms may include chest pain, shortness of breath, leg pain, problems speaking, or problems moving parts of the body. As clotting factors and platelets are used up, bleeding may occur. This may include blood in the urine, blood in the stool, or bleeding into the skin. Complications may include organ failure."
Hemorrhagic Stroke,"Dizziness, headache, nausea and vomiting, restlessness, impaired limb mobility, consciousness disorders, and even coma","Stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to a part of the brain causes cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. Both cause parts of the brain to stop functioning properly.
Signs and symptoms of stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, dizziness, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred."
Uterine Subinvolution,"Irregular vaginal bleeding, increased secretions, abdominal pain, backache","Subinvolution is a medical condition in which after childbirth, the uterus does not return to its normal size.


== Presentation ==


=== Symptoms ===
The condition may be asymptomatic. The predominant symptoms are: 

Abnormal lochial discharge, either excessive or prolonged
Irregular or at times excessive uterine bleeding
Irregular cramp-like pain is cases of retained products or rise of temperature in sepsis


=== Signs ===
The uterine height is greater than the normal for the particular day of puerperium. Normal puerperal uterus may be displaced by a full bladder or a loaded rectum. It feels boggy and softer upon palpation."
Thrombophlebitis,"Inferior vena cava thrombosis, diffuse lower limb edema, cyanotic skin discoloration, painful femoral white edema, venous thrombosis, microthrombus formation, stiff edema of palms, upper limb and facial venous varicosity, edema and cyanosis, premature slothing or detachment of burn eschar, or insect bite-like changes, superficial streaky bands on the chest and abdominal wall with pain or drawing pain, red streaks, wandering superficial veins, superior vena cava","Thrombophlebitis is a phlebitis (inflammation of a vein) related to a thrombus (blood clot). When it occurs repeatedly in different locations, it is known as thrombophlebitis migrans (migratory thrombophlebitis).


== Signs and symptoms ==
The following symptoms or signs are often associated with thrombophlebitis, although thrombophlebitis is not restricted to the veins of the legs.

Pain (area affected)
Skin redness/inflammation
Edema
Veins (hard and cord-like)
Tenderness


=== Complications ===
Complications of thrombophlebitis include infection of the vein, concurrent thromboembolism, or recurrent thrombophlebitis.
Infection of the vein can include symptoms such as high fever, redness of the site that can spread, and purulent drainage, making it septic or suppurative thrombophlebitis."
Cold Agglutinin Disease,"Cyanosis of the auricles, nasal tip, fingers, and toes","Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of high concentrations of circulating cold sensitive antibodies, usually IgM and autoantibodies that are also active at temperatures below 30 C (86 F), directed against red blood cells, causing them to agglutinate and undergo lysis. It is a form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, specifically one in which antibodies bind red blood cells only at low body temperatures, typically 2831 C.
When affected people's blood is exposed to cold temperatures (32 F (0 C; 273 K) to 50 F (10 C; 283 K)), certain proteins that normally attack bacteria (IgM antibodies) attach themselves to red blood cells and bind them together into clumps (agglutination). This eventually causes red blood cells to be prematurely destroyed (hemolysis) leading to anemia and other associated signs and symptoms.
Cold agglutinin disease can be primary (unknown cause) or secondary, due to an underlying condition such as an infection, another autoimmune disease, or certain cancers. Treatment depends on many factors including the severity of the condition, the signs and symptoms present in each person, and the underlying cause."
Peripartum Cardiomyopathy,"Palpitations, Dyspnea, Orthopnea, Cough, Arrhythmia, Rales, Jugular Venous Distention, Lower extremity edema, Fatigue","Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a form of dilated cardiomyopathy that is defined as a deterioration in cardiac function presenting typically between the last month of pregnancy and up to six months postpartum.  As with other forms of dilated cardiomyopathy, PPCM involves systolic dysfunction of the heart with a decrease of the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) with associated congestive heart failure and an increased risk of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, thromboembolism (blockage of a blood vessel by a blood clot), and even sudden cardiac death.  In essence, the heart muscle cannot contract forcefully enough to pump adequate amounts of blood for the needs of the body's vital organs.
PPCM is a diagnosis of exclusion, wherein patients have no prior history of heart disease and there are no other known possible causes of heart failure. Echocardiography is used to both diagnose and monitor the effectiveness of treatment for PPCM.
The cause of PPCM is unknown."
Congenital Anal Atresia,"Absence of meconium discharge, irritability, abdominal distension, vomiting, absence of anus","A rectal prolapse occurs when walls of the rectum have prolapsed to such a degree that they protrude out of the anus and are visible outside the body. However, most researchers agree that there are 3 to 5 different types of rectal prolapse, depending on whether the prolapsed section is visible externally, and whether the full or only partial thickness of the rectal wall is involved.
Rectal prolapse may occur without any symptoms, but depending upon the nature of the prolapse there may be mucous discharge (mucus coming from the anus), rectal bleeding, degrees of fecal incontinence, and obstructed defecation symptoms.
Rectal prolapse is generally more common in elderly women, although it may occur at any age and in either sex. It is very rarely life-threatening, but the symptoms can be debilitating if left untreated."
Puerperal Infection,"Fever, abdominal pain, abnormal lochia, vulvar burning sensation, vulvar scorching during urination, itching or pain, vulvar itching, sepsis, vulvar pain, postpartum lower abdominal dragging pain or vaginal swelling sensation, local redness, swelling, heat and pain around vaginal opening, vaginal purulent discharge, cervical mucous purulent discharge, dysuria, frequent urination","Postpartum infections, also known as childbed fever and puerperal fever, are any bacterial infections of the female reproductive tract following childbirth or miscarriage. Signs and symptoms usually include a fever greater than 38.0 C (100.4 F), chills, lower abdominal pain, and possibly odorous vaginal discharge. It usually occurs after the first 24 hours and within the first ten days following delivery.
The most common infection is that of the uterus and surrounding tissues known as puerperal sepsis, postpartum metritis, or postpartum endometritis. Risk factors include caesarean section (C-section), the presence of certain bacteria such as group B streptococcus in the vagina, premature rupture of membranes, multiple vaginal exams, manual removal of the placenta, and prolonged labour among others."
Strichnine Poisoning,"Restlessness, dysphagia, abnormal pupils, tremors, convulsions, seizures, opisthotonos, risus sardonicus, asphyxia, cyanosis, loss of consciousness","Strychnine poisoning is poisoning induced by strychnine. It can be fatal to humans and other animals and can occur by inhalation, swallowing or absorption through eyes or mouth. It produces some of the most dramatic and painful symptoms of any known toxic reaction, making it quite noticeable and a common choice for assassinations and poison attacks. For this reason, strychnine poisoning is often portrayed in literature and film, such as the murder mysteries written by Agatha Christie.
The probable lethal oral dose in humans is 1.5 to 2 mg/kg."
Brazilian Purpuric Fever,"Purpura, abdominal pain, high fever, shock, diarrhea, hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding, oliguria, cyanosis, tearing, vomiting, altered mental status","Brazilian purpuric fever (BPF) is an illness of children caused by the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius which is ultimately fatal due to sepsis. BPF was first recognized in the So Paulo state of Brazil in 1984. At this time, young children between the ages of 3 months and 10 years were contracting a strange illness which was characterized by high fever and purpuric lesions on the body. These cases were all fatal, and originally thought to be due to meningitis.  It was not until the autopsies were conducted that the cause of these deaths was confirmed to be infection by H. influenzae aegyptius."
Amniotic Band Syndrome,"Fetal distress, delayed fetal growth and development, brachycephaly, increased lip creases deformities, dolichocephaly, foot deformities, limb shortening deformities","Constriction ring syndrome (CRS) is a congenital disorder with unknown cause. Because of the unknown cause there are many different, and sometimes incorrect, names. It is a malformation due to intrauterine bands or rings that produce deep grooves in (most commonly distal) extremities such as fingers and toes. In rare cases the constriction ring can form around other parts of the fetus and cause amputation or even intrauterine death. The anatomy proximal to the site of constriction (or amputation) is developmentally normal."
Monocytic Leukemia,"Nodules, papules, gingival swelling and pain, vesicular or bullous lesions","Acute monocytic leukemia (AMoL, or AML-M5) is a type of acute myeloid leukemia. In AML-M5 >80% of the leukemic cells are of monocytic lineage. This cancer is characterized by a dominance of monocytes in the bone marrow. There is an overproduction of monocytes that the body does not need in the periphery. These overproduced monocytes interfere with normal immune cell production which causes many health complications for the affected individual."
Childhood Extracellular Cholesterol Deposition Syndrome,"Maculopapular rash, nodules, erythema multiforme-like rash, hepatosplenomegaly, hepatomegaly, desquamation, splenomegaly, pigmentary abnormalities","Atherosclerosis is a pattern of the disease arteriosclerosis, characterized by development of abnormalities called lesions in walls of arteries. This is a chronic inflammatory disease involving many different cell types and is driven by elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood. These lesions may lead to narrowing of the arterial walls due to buildup of atheromatous plaques. At the onset there are usually no symptoms, but if they develop, symptoms generally begin around middle age. In severe cases, it can result in coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or kidney disorders, depending on which body part(s) the affected arteries are located in the body."
Uterine Malignant Mixed Mllerian Tumor (MMMT),"Abnormal vaginal bleeding, lower abdomen or pelvic pain, vaginal discharge with or without tissue-like material, palpable mass in lower abdomen","A malignant mixed Mllerian tumor, also known as malignant mixed mesodermal tumor (MMMT) is a cancer found in the uterus, the ovaries, the fallopian tubes and other parts of the body that contains both carcinomatous (epithelial tissue) and sarcomatous (connective tissue) components.  It is divided into two types, homologous (in which the sarcomatous component is made of tissues found in the uterus such as endometrial, fibrous and/or smooth muscle tissues) and a heterologous type (made up of tissues not found in the uterus, such as cartilage, skeletal muscle and/or bone).  MMMT account for between two and five percent of all tumors derived from the body of the uterus, and are found predominantly in postmenopausal women with an average age of 66 years.  Risk factors are similar to those of adenocarcinomas and include obesity, exogenous estrogen therapies, and nulliparity.  Less well-understood but potential risk factors include tamoxifen therapy and pelvic irradiation."
Metastatic Liver Cancer,"Liver pain, jaundice, hepatic mass","Metastatic breast cancer, also referred to as metastases, advanced breast cancer, secondary tumors, secondaries or stage IV breast cancer, is a stage of breast cancer where the breast cancer cells have spread to distant sites beyond the axillary lymph nodes. There is no cure for metastatic breast cancer;  there is no stage after IV.
Metastases can occur several years after the primary breast cancer, although it is sometimes diagnosed at the same time as the primary breast cancer or, rarely, before the primary breast cancer has been diagnosed.
Metastatic breast cancer cells frequently differ from the preceding primary breast cancer in properties such as receptor status. The cells have often developed resistance to several lines of previous treatment and have acquired special properties that permit them to metastasize to distant sites. Metastatic breast cancer can be treated, sometimes for many years, but it cannot be cured."
Compartment Syndrome,"Deep subcutaneous fascial progressive necrotizing infection, body pain, neck and shoulder pain, joint pain, lower leg or forearm compartment syndrome, fascial pain","Compartment syndrome is a serious medical condition in which increased pressure within a body compartment compromises blood flow and tissue function, potentially leading to permanent damage if not promptly treated. There are two types: acute and chronic. Acute compartment syndrome can lead to a loss of the affected limb due to tissue death.
Symptoms of acute compartment syndrome (ACS) include severe pain, decreased blood flow, decreased movement, numbness, and a pale limb. It is most often due to physical trauma, like a bone fracture (up to 75% of cases) or a crush injury."
Cardiac Cirrhosis,"Jaundice, general fatigue, poor appetite, nausea and vomiting, hematemesis, spider angiomas, ascites, distended neck veins, abdominal wall vein distention, splenomegaly, palpitations and chest tightness","Congestive hepatopathy is liver dysfunction due to venous congestion, usually due to congestive heart failure. The gross pathological appearance of a liver affected by chronic passive congestion is ""speckled"" like a grated nutmeg kernel; the dark spots represent the dilated and congested hepatic venules and small hepatic veins. The paler areas are unaffected surrounding liver tissue. When severe and longstanding, hepatic congestion can lead to fibrosis; if congestion is due to right heart failure, it is called cardiac cirrhosis.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms depend largely upon the primary lesions giving rise to the condition."
Goiter,"Neck lump, irritability, excessive sweating, chest tightness, heart palpitations, menstrual irregularity","Golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit a ball into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible.
Golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not use a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game. Courses typically have either 9 or 18 holes, regions of terrain that each contain a cup, the hole that receives the ball. Each hole on a course has a teeing ground for the hole's first stroke, and a putting green containing the cup. There are several standard forms of terrain between the tee and the green, such as the fairway, rough (tall grass), and various hazards that may be water, rocks, or sand-filled bunkers."
Pregnancy Complicated with Polycystic Kidney Disease,"Pyuria, frequent urination, renal failure, chronic kidney failure, pregnancy-related proteinuria, gestational hypertension, hard mass in the abdomen of pregnant women, back pain with frequent urination, urgency of urination, painful urination, persistent abdominal or back pain during pregnancy, back and abdominal pain in pregnant women, lower abdominal mass","Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, abdominal distension, and weight loss. Complications outside of the gastrointestinal tract may include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and fatigue. The skin rashes may be due to infections, as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction may occur as a complication of chronic inflammation, and those with the disease are at greater risk of colon cancer and small bowel cancer."
Penile Amputation,"Penile trauma, anemia, pallor, decreased blood pressure, shock","Penectomy is penis removal through surgery, generally for medical or personal reasons.


== Medical reasons for penectomy ==
Cancer, for example, sometimes necessitates removal of part or all of the penis. The amount of penis removed depends on the severity of the cancer. Some men have only the tip of their penis removed. For others with more advanced cancer, the entire penis must be removed."
Bundle Branch Reentrant Ventricular Tachycardia,"Tachycardia, palpitations, chest discomfort, frequent ventricular premature contractions, frequent atrial premature beats, chest pain, dyspnea, sudden death, ectopic tachycardia, gallop rhythm in diastolic late phase, and retrograde atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia","Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach or VT) is a cardiovascular disorder in which fast heart rate occurs in the ventricles of the heart. Although a few seconds of VT may not result in permanent problems, longer periods are dangerous; and multiple episodes over a short period of time are referred to as an electrical storm. Short periods may occur without symptoms, or present with lightheadedness, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, and decreased level of consciousness. Ventricular tachycardia may lead to coma and persistent vegetative state due to lack of blood and oxygen to the brain. Ventricular tachycardia may result in ventricular fibrillation (VF) and turn into cardiac arrest."
Chlorine Poisoning,"Chest tightness, coughing, chest pain, rapid breathing, edema, dyspnea, hoarseness, cyanosis, expectoration of a large amount of bloody frothy sputum","Chlorine gas poisoning  is an illness resulting from the effects of exposure to chlorine beyond the threshold limit value. Acute chlorine gas poisoning primarily affects the respiratory system, causing difficulty breathing, cough, irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, and sometimes skin irritation. Higher exposures can lead to severe lung damage, such as toxic pneumonitis or pulmonary edema, with concentrations around 400 ppm and beyond potentially fatal. Chronic exposure to low levels can result in respiratory issues like asthma and chronic cough. Common exposure sources include occupational settings, accidental chemical mixing, and industrial accidents."
Pancreatic Tuberculosis,"Fever, night sweats, abdominal pain, abdominal mass, weight loss, anemia, jaundice","A tuberculoma is a clinical manifestation of tuberculosis which conglomerates tubercles into a firm lump, and so can mimic cancer tumors of many types in medical imaging studies. They often arise within individuals in whom a primary tuberculosis infection is not well controlled. When tuberculomas arise intracranially, they represent a manifestation of CNS tuberculosis. Since these are evolutions of primary complex, the tuberculomas may contain caseum or calcifications.
With the passage of time, Mycobacterium tuberculosis can transform into crystals of calcium."
Carbon Monoxide Poisoning,"Headache, weakness, dizziness, cherry red color of lips with possible nausea, vomiting, confusion, collapse or coma, accompanied by high fever, increased muscle tone in the limbs, and episodic or tonic-clonic seizures","Carbon monoxide poisoning typically occurs from breathing in carbon monoxide (CO) at excessive levels. Symptoms are often described as ""flu-like"" and commonly include headache, dizziness, weakness, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. Large exposures can result in loss of consciousness, arrhythmias, seizures, or death. The classically described ""cherry red skin"" rarely occurs. Long-term complications may include chronic fatigue, trouble with memory, and movement problems."
Choroideremia,"Decreased vision, myopia","Choroideremia (; CHM) is a rare, X-linked recessive form of hereditary retinal degeneration that affects roughly 1 in 50,000 males. The disease causes a gradual loss of vision, starting with childhood night blindness, followed by peripheral vision loss and progressing to loss of central vision later in life. Progression continues throughout the individual's life, but both the rate of change and the degree of visual loss are variable among those affected, even within the same family.
Choroideremia is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the CHM gene which encodes Rab escort protein 1 (REP1), a protein involved in lipid modification of Rab proteins. While the complete mechanism of disease is not fully understood, the lack of a functional protein in the retina results in cell death and the gradual deterioration of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), photoreceptors and the choroid."
Pulmonary Blast Injury,"Hemoptysis, frothy sputum, dyspnea, respiratory failure, difficulty breathing, blood-streaked sputum, cyanosis, cough, chest pain, shock, alveolar hemorrhage, atelectasis","A blast injury is a complex type of physical trauma resulting from direct or indirect exposure to an explosion. Blast injuries occur with the detonation of high-order explosives as well as the deflagration of low order explosives. These injuries are compounded when the explosion occurs in a confined space.


== Classification ==

Blast injuries are divided into four classes: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.


=== Primary injuries ===
Primary injuries are caused by blast overpressure waves, or shock waves."
Comminuted Fracture,"Pain, tenderness, local swelling, bruising","A bone fracture (abbreviated FRX or Fx, Fx, or #) is a medical condition in which there is a partial or complete break in the continuity of any bone in the body. In more severe cases, the bone may be broken into several fragments, known as a comminuted fracture. An open fracture (or compound fracture) is a bone fracture where the broken bone breaks through the skin. 
A bone fracture may be the result of high force impact or stress, or a minimal trauma injury as a result of certain medical conditions that weaken the bones, such as osteoporosis, osteopenia, bone cancer, or osteogenesis imperfecta, where the fracture is then properly termed a pathologic fracture. Most bone fractures require urgent medical attention to prevent further injury."
Neurolemmoma,"The skin lesions are firm, pink or reddish-brown papules and nodules.","A schwannoma (or neurilemmoma) is a usually benign nerve sheath tumor composed of Schwann cells, which normally produce the insulating myelin sheath covering peripheral nerves.
Schwannomas are homogeneous tumors, consisting only of Schwann cells. The tumor cells always stay on the outside of the nerve, but the tumor itself may either push the nerve aside and/or up against a bony structure (thereby possibly causing damage). Schwannomas are relatively slow-growing. For reasons not yet understood, schwannomas are mostly benign and less than 1% become malignant, degenerating into a form of cancer known as neurofibrosarcoma."
Pulmonary Valve Stenosis,"Chest tightness, shortness of breath, suffocation","Pulmonary valve stenosis (PVS) is a heart valve disorder. Blood going from the heart to the lungs goes through the pulmonary valve, whose purpose is to prevent blood from flowing back to the heart. In pulmonary valve stenosis this opening is too narrow, leading to a reduction of flow of blood to the lungs.
While the most common cause of pulmonary valve stenosis is congenital heart disease, it may also be due to a malignant carcinoid tumor. Both stenosis of the pulmonary artery and pulmonary valve stenosis are forms of pulmonic stenosis (nonvalvular and valvular, respectively) but pulmonary valve stenosis accounts for 80% of pulmonic stenosis."
Gastric Neurofibroma,"Vomiting blood, melena, abdominal pain, nausea, indigestion, loss of appetite, abdominal discomfort","The following is a list of cancer types. Cancer is a group of diseases that involve abnormal increases in the number of cells, with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors or lumps are cancerous; benign tumors are not classified as being cancer because they do not spread to other parts of the body. There are over 100 different known cancers that affect humans.
Cancers are often described by the body part that they originated in."
Orbital Fibrous Histiocytoma,"Proptosis, visual disturbances, restricted ocular movement, eye pain","Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS), although a rare type of tumor, is one of the most common soft tissue sarcomas, i.e. cancerous tumors, that develop in the soft tissues of elderly individuals. Initially considered to be a type of histiocytoma termed fibrous histiocytoma or myxoid variant of malignant fibrous histiocytoma, Angervall et al. termed this tumor myxofibrosarcoma in 1977. In 2020, the World Health Organization reclassified MFS as a separate and distinct tumor in the category of malignant fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors."
Congenital Intestinal Malrotation,"Emaciation, shock, fever, dehydration, nausea and vomiting, rectal bleeding","Intestinal malrotation is a congenital anomaly of rotation of the midgut. It occurs during the first trimester as the fetal gut undergoes a complex series of growth and development. Malrotation can lead to a dangerous complication called volvulus, in which cases emergency surgery is indicated. Malrotation can refer to a spectrum of abnormal intestinal positioning, often including:

The small intestine found predominantly on the right side of the abdomen
The cecum displaced from its usual position in the right lower quadrant into the epigastrium or right hypochondrium
An absent or displaced ligament of Treitz
Fibrous peritoneal bands called bands of Ladd running across the vertical portion of the duodenum
An unusually narrow, stalk-like mesentery
The position of the intestines, narrow mesentery and Ladd's bands can contribute to several severe gastrointestinal conditions. The narrow mesentery predisposes some cases of malrotation to midgut volvulus, a twisting of the entire small bowel that can obstruct the mesenteric blood vessels leading to intestinal ischemia, necrosis, and death if not promptly treated."
Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma,"The tumor is located in muscles or fascia, grows slowly, is palpable with a pulsation, and is not tender to touch.","Alveolar soft part sarcoma, abbreviated ASPS, is a very rare type of soft-tissue sarcoma, that grows slowly and whose cell of origin is unknown.
ASPS arises mainly in children and young adults and can migrate (metastasize) into other parts of the body, typically the lungs and the brain. Typically, ASPS arises in muscles and deep soft tissue of the thigh or the leg (lower extremities), but can also appear in the upper extremities (hands, neck, and head). While ASPS is a soft tissue sarcoma, it can also spread and grow inside the bones.


== Etymology ==
The term alveolar comes from the microscopic pattern, visible during the analysis of slides of ASPS under the microscope in histopathology."
Neonatal Coxsackievirus B Infection,"The onset of the disease in affected infants is abrupt, presenting with fever (temperature often above 38°C), irregular fever patterns, irritability during febrile periods, decreased milk intake, vomiting, and diarrhea.","Coxsackieviruses are a few related enteroviruses that belong to the Picornaviridae family of nonenveloped, linear, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, as well as its genus Enterovirus, which also includes poliovirus and echovirus. Enteroviruses are among the most common and important human pathogens, and ordinarily its members are transmitted by the fecaloral route. Coxsackieviruses share many characteristics with poliovirus. With control of poliovirus infections in much of the world, more attention has been focused on understanding the nonpolio enteroviruses such as coxsackievirus.
Coxsackieviruses are among the leading causes of aseptic meningitis (the other usual suspects being echovirus and mumps virus)."
Sarcoma,"Local pain, swelling with local skin erythema, joint effusion, limited joint mobility and pain, low-grade fever, fatigue, and general malaise","A sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that arises from cells of mesenchymal origin. Originating from mesenchymal cells means that sarcomas are cancers of connective tissues such as bone, cartilage, muscle, fat, or vascular tissues. 
Sarcomas are one of five different types of cancer, classified by the cell type from which they originate. While there are five types under this category, sarcomas are most frequently contrasted with carcinomas which are much more common. Sarcomas are quite rare, making up about 1% of all adult cancer diagnoses and 15% of childhood cancer diagnoses."
Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC),"Breast swelling, nipple discharge, skin ulceration of the breast","Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is one of the most aggressive types of breast cancer. It can occur in women of any age (and, extremely rarely, in men, see male breast cancer). It is referred to as ""inflammatory"" due to its frequent presentation with symptoms resembling a skin inflammation, such as erysipelas. 
Inflammatory breast cancer presents with variable signs and symptoms, frequently without detectable lumps or tumors; it therefore is often not detected by mammography or ultrasound. Typical presentation is rapid breast swelling, sometimes associated with skin changes (peau d'orange), and nipple retraction."
Acute Suppurative Mastitis,"Breast redness, swelling, heat pain, sensation of fluctuation, fever","Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis (SPT), also known as suppurative pelvic thrombophlebitis, is a rare postpartum complication which consists of a persistent postpartum fever that is not responsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics, in which pelvic infection leads to infection of the vein wall and intimal damage leading to thrombogenesis in the ovarian veins (left or right, although right is more common due to dextroversion of the uterus). The thrombus is then invaded by microorganisms.  Ascending infections cause 99% of postpartum SPT.
Septic pelvis thrombophlembitis is a cause of post-operative fever from untreated postpartum endometritis or parametritis. After 48 hours of unresolved postpartum endometritis (notably 48 hours of fever that is unaffected by antibiotics), SPT is assumed until proven otherwise (with pelvic radiography). Imaging studies can be helpful in patient refractory to broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics to look for abscess, retained products, or septic pelvic thrombophlebitis."
Septic Shock in the Elderly,"Pulmonary infection (common), nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension, diarrhea, clouding of consciousness, apathetic demeanor, low-grade fever, hypotension, tachycardia, syncope","Septic shock is a potentially fatal medical condition that occurs when sepsis, which is organ injury or damage in response to infection, leads to dangerously low blood pressure and abnormalities in cellular metabolism. The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) defines septic shock as a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Patients with septic shock can be clinically identified by requiring a vasopressor to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mm Hg or greater and having serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (>18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia. This combination is associated with hospital mortality rates greater than 40%.
The primary infection is most commonly caused by bacteria, but also may be by fungi, viruses or parasites."
Osteosarcoma,"Bone pain, muscle pain, joint pain, bone swelling, lung metastasis, body pain, fever","An osteosarcoma (OS) or osteogenic sarcoma (OGS) is a cancerous tumor in a bone. Specifically, it is an aggressive malignant neoplasm that arises from primitive transformed cells of mesenchymal origin (and thus a sarcoma) and that exhibits osteoblastic differentiation and produces malignant osteoid.
Osteosarcoma is the most common histological form of primary bone sarcoma. It is most prevalent in teenagers and young adults.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Many patients first complain of pain that may be worse at night, may be intermittent and of varying intensity and may have been occurring for a long time."
Abdominal Major Vascular Injury,"Arterial bleeding, vomiting, abdominal muscle spasms, venous bleeding","A gunshot wound (GSW) is a penetrating injury caused by a projectile (e.g. a bullet) shot from a gun (typically a firearm). Damage may include bleeding, bone fractures, organ damage, wound infection, and loss of the ability to move part of the body. Damage depends on the part of the body hit, the path the bullet follows through (or into) the body, and the type and speed of the bullet. In severe cases, although not uncommon, the injury is fatal."
Acute left heart failure in the elderly,"Dyspnea, pink frothy sputum, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, cyanosis of the lips, restlessness","Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a sudden worsening of the signs and symptoms of heart failure, which typically includes difficulty breathing (dyspnea), leg or feet swelling, and fatigue. ADHF is a common and potentially serious cause of acute respiratory distress. The condition is caused by severe congestion of multiple organs by fluid that is inadequately circulated by the failing heart. An attack of decompensation can be caused by underlying medical illness, such as myocardial infarction, an abnormal heart rhythm, infection, or thyroid disease.


== Acute Heart Failure ==
Heart failure or cardiovascular insufficiency can be acute without being decompensated from a chronic condition."
Pneumococcal Pneumonia,"High fever, chills, muscle soreness, poor appetite, fatigue, restlessness, moaning, and shortness of breath","Pneumococcal pneumonia is a type of bacterial pneumonia that is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). It is the most common bacterial pneumonia found in adults, the most common type of community-acquired pneumonia, and one of the common types of pneumococcal infection. The estimated number of Americans with pneumococcal pneumonia is 900,000 annually, with almost 400,000 cases hospitalized and fatalities accounting for 5-7% of these cases.


== Symptoms ==
The symptoms of pneumococcal pneumonia can occur suddenly, presenting as a severe chill, followed by a severe fever, cough, shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and chest pains. Other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, and muscle aches could also accompany initial symptoms."
Multiple Myeloma,"Osteolytic lesions, dull chest pain, tumor cell infiltration, diffuse osteoporosis, widespread osteoporosis","Multiple myeloma (MM), also known as plasma cell myeloma and simply myeloma, is a cancer of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell that normally produces antibodies. Often, no symptoms are noticed initially. As it progresses, bone pain, anemia, renal insufficiency, and infections may occur. Complications may include hypercalcemia and amyloidosis.
The cause of multiple myeloma is unknown."
Pediatric Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS),"Pallor, anemia, hemolysis, oliguria, acute hemolytic uremic syndrome, hemolytic anemia, coma, blue urine in children, metabolic acidosis, acute renal failure, hematochezia, abdominal pain","Hemolyticuremic syndrome (HUS) is a syndrome characterized by low red blood cells, acute kidney injury (previously called acute renal failure), and low platelets. Initial symptoms typically include bloody diarrhea, fever, vomiting, and weakness. Kidney problems and low platelets then occur as the diarrhea progresses. Children are more commonly affected, but most children recover without permanent damage to their health, although some children may have serious and sometimes life-threatening complications. Adults, especially the elderly, may show a more complicated presentation."
Iris Cyst,"Blurred vision, color vision abnormalities, foreign body sensation","Iris cysts are hollow cavities in the eye filled with secretion. They come in various sizes, numbers, shapes, pigments and can be free-floating, attached to the pupillary margin or within the posterior chamber. Most frequently iris cysts don't cause any issues, but they can cause problems like: ""fly biting"" behavior, corneal endothelial pigment, lens capsular pigmentation, altered iris movement, decreased aqueous outflow with subsequent glaucoma or block the vision when grown too big. They can be acquired or innate. Possible causes are inflammation, drug-induced, uveitis, a trauma, tumor-induced, parasitic or implantation."
Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors,"Jaundice, petechiae, erythema, weakness, hyperhidrosis, tremors, hyperactivity, anxiety, fatigue, headache, dizziness, disorientation, seizures, confusion, weight loss, diarrhea","Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (PanNETs, PETs, or PNETs), often referred to as ""islet cell tumours"", or ""pancreatic endocrine tumours"" are neuroendocrine neoplasms that arise from cells of the endocrine (hormonal) and nervous system within the pancreas.
PanNETs are a type of neuroendocrine tumor, representing about one-third of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). Many PanNETs are benign, while some are malignant. Aggressive PanNET tumors have traditionally been termed ""islet cell carcinoma"".
PanNETs are quite distinct from the usual form of pancreatic cancer, the majority of which are adenocarcinomas, which arise in the exocrine pancreas."
Amoebic Dysentery,"Abdominal discomfort, bloating and abdominal pain, alternating diarrhea and constipation, mucus or bloody pus stool, dysentery-like stools can increase up to 10-15 times per day or more, accompanied by tenesmus.","Amoebiasis, or amoebic dysentery, is an infection of the intestines caused by a parasitic amoeba Entamoeba histolytica. Amoebiasis can be present with no, mild, or severe symptoms. Symptoms may include lethargy, loss of weight, colonic ulcerations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or bloody diarrhea. Complications can include inflammation and ulceration of the colon with tissue death or perforation, which may result in peritonitis. Anemia may develop due to prolonged gastric bleeding."
Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome,"Hematemesis and melena, hemolytic anemia, anuria, hematuria, oliguria, abdominal pain, diarrhea, jaundice, coma, brown urine, pyrroluria and guanidinuria, acute hemolytic uremic syndrome","Hemolyticuremic syndrome (HUS) is a syndrome characterized by low red blood cells, acute kidney injury (previously called acute renal failure), and low platelets. Initial symptoms typically include bloody diarrhea, fever, vomiting, and weakness. Kidney problems and low platelets then occur as the diarrhea progresses. Children are more commonly affected, but most children recover without permanent damage to their health, although some children may have serious and sometimes life-threatening complications. Adults, especially the elderly, may show a more complicated presentation."
Marie-Bamberger Syndrome,"Clubbed fingers (toes), joint pain, joint swelling","Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is a medical condition combining clubbing and periostitis of the small hand joints, especially the distal interphalangeal joints and the metacarpophalangeal joints. Distal expansion of the long bones as well as painful, swollen joints and synovial villous proliferation are often seen. The condition may occur alone (primary), or it may be secondary to diseases like lung cancer. Among patients with lung cancer, it is most associated with adenocarcinoma and least associated with small cell lung cancer. These patients often get clubbing and increased bone deposition on long bones."
Sheehan's Syndrome,"Amenorrhea, pallor, edema","Sheehan's syndrome, also known as postpartum pituitary gland necrosis, occurs when the pituitary gland is damaged due to significant blood loss and hypovolemic shock (ischemic necrosis) or stroke, originally described during or after childbirth leading to decreased functioning of the pituitary gland (hypopituitarism). Classically, in the milder partial form, the mother is unable to breastfeed her baby, due to failure of the pituitary to secrete the hormone prolactin, and also has no more periods, because FSH (Follicle Stimulating Hormone) and LH (Luteinising Hormone) are not secreted. Although postmenopausal, the mother with this milder form of Sheehan's syndrome does not experience hot flushes, because the pituitary fails to secrete FSH (high levels of FSH, secreted by the pituitary in healthy postmenopausal women is an attempt to trigger ovulation, and these high levels of FSH cause hot the flushes). The failure to breastfeed and amenorrhea no more periods, were seen as the syndrome (a collection of symptoms), but we now view Sheehan's as the pituitary failing to secrete 1-5 of the 9 hormones that it normally produces (the anterior (front) lobe of the pituitary produces FSH, LH, prolactin, ACTH (Adreno-cortico-trophic hormone),TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone) and GH (Growth Hormone); the posterior (the lobe at the back) pituitary produces ADH (Anti-Diuretic Hormone) and Oxytocin, i.e. the pituitary is involved in the regulation of many hormones."
Nodular Epidermolysis Bullosa,"Scales, nodules","A dermatofibroma, or benign fibrous histiocytomas, is a benign nodule in the skin, typically on the legs, elbows or chest of an adult. It is usually painless.
It usually ranges from 0.2 to 2 cm in size but larger examples have been reported. It typically results from mild trauma such as an insect bite. Risk factors for developing multiple dermatofibromas include lupus, HIV, blood cancer and some medicines that weaken immunity."
Varicella-Zoster Virus Uveitis,"Erythema, crust formation, lymphadenopathy, vesicles, papules, pigmentation, neuralgia, optic atrophy, limb atrophy, cicatricial skin lesions, cerebral atrophy, somnolence, developmental delay","Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO), also known as ophthalmic zoster, is shingles involving the eye or the surrounding area. Common signs include a rash of the forehead with swelling of the eyelid. There may also be eye pain and redness, inflammation of the conjunctiva, cornea or uvea, and sensitivity to light. Fever and tingling of the skin and allodynia near the eye may precede the rash. Complications may include visual impairment, increased pressure within the eye, chronic pain, and stroke."
Solitary Pilomatricoma,"Solitary papules occurring on the nose and cheeks, with diameters ranging from 3 to 8 mm","Trichoepithelioma is a neoplasm of the adnexa of the skin. Its appearance is similar to basal cell carcinoma.
One form has been mapped to chromosome 9p21.


== Types ==
Trichoepitheliomas may be divided into the following types::672

Multiple familial trichoepithelioma
Solitary trichoepithelioma

Pediatric Electrocution and Lightning Strike,"Nausea, rapid breathing, coma, pallor, dizziness, weakness, tachycardia, palpitations","Endocardial fibroelastosis (EFE) is a rare heart disorder usually occurring in children two years old and younger. It may also be considered a reaction to stress, not necessarily a specific disease.
It should not be confused with endomyocardial fibrosis.


== Signs and symptoms ==
EFE is characterized by a thickening of the innermost lining of the heart chambers (the endocardium) due to an increase in the amount of supporting connective tissue and elastic fibres. It is an uncommon cause of unexplained heart failure in infants and children, and is one component of HEC syndrome."
Opioid Poisoning,"Headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, coma, respiratory depression, seizures, pinpoint pupils, difficulty breathing, emaciation, constipation","An opioid overdose is toxicity due to excessive consumption of opioids, such as morphine, codeine, heroin, fentanyl, tramadol, and methadone. This preventable pathology can be fatal if it leads to respiratory depression, a lethal condition that can cause hypoxia from slow and shallow breathing. Other symptoms include small pupils and unconsciousness; however, its onset can depend on the method of ingestion, the dosage and individual risk factors. Although there were over 110,000 deaths in 2017 due to opioids, individuals who survived also faced adverse complications, including permanent brain damage.
Opioid overdoses are diagnosed based on symptoms and examination."
Chronic Subdural Hematoma in the Elderly,"Tremors, coma, hematoma formation, headache, vertigo, choking cough when drinking water","A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a type of bleeding in which a collection of bloodusually but not always associated with a traumatic brain injurygathers between the inner layer of the dura mater and the arachnoid mater of the meninges surrounding the brain. It usually results from rips in bridging veins that cross the subdural space.
Subdural hematomas may cause an increase in the pressure inside the skull, which in turn can cause compression of and damage to delicate brain tissue. Acute subdural hematomas are often life-threatening. Chronic subdural hematomas have a better prognosis if properly managed."
Pediatric Pneumothorax,"Chest tightness and difficulty breathing, accompanied by irritating cough","Pediatric advanced life support (PALS) is a course offered by the American Heart Association (AHA) for health care providers who take care of children and infants in the emergency room, critical care and intensive care units in the hospital, and out of hospital (emergency medical services (EMS)). The course teaches healthcare providers how to assess injured and sick children and recognize and treat respiratory distress/failure, shock, cardiac arrest, and arrhythmias.


== Basic Life Support (BLS) ==

PALS builds upon AHA's Pediatric Basic Life Support (BLS). Providers should follow the AHA's Pediatric BLS Algorithms for single and  2 person rescuer. The most essential component of BLS and PALS cardiac arrest care is high quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)."
Phacolytic Glaucoma,"Blurred vision, vision loss","Phacolytic glaucoma (PG) is a form of glaucoma which is caused due to a leaking mature or immature cataract. Inflammatory glaucoma which occurs in phacolysis is a condition which is a result of the leakage of protein within the lens into the capsule of a mature or hyper mature cataract and involves a simple procedure to be cured that is referred to as cataract extraction.
The main symptoms of glaucoma include pain in the eye, redness and loss of sight, all of which reduce an individual's independence, in turn, reducing quality of life and an individual's ability to fulfill other societal roles (such as driving and reading) as it reduces visual clarity. Phacolysis tends to be more frequently reported in underdeveloped countries because of the lack of resources necessary to treat such as condition.


== Signs and symptoms ==
There are a variety of characteristics which indicate that an individual may have phacolytic glaucoma."
Pediatric Hepatitis E,"Jaundice, loss of appetite, liver area pain, fever, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, decreased activity tolerance","Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue. Some people or animals with hepatitis have no symptoms, whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hepatitis is acute if it resolves within six months, and chronic if it lasts longer than six months. Acute hepatitis can resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or (rarely) result in acute liver failure. Chronic hepatitis may progress to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer."
Intermediate Streptococcal Infection,"Gingival swelling, sepsis, bacterial endocarditis","Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins also known as erythrogenic toxins, are exotoxins secreted by strains of the bacterial species Streptococcus pyogenes. SpeA and speC are superantigens, which induce inflammation by nonspecifically activating T cells and stimulating the production of inflammatory cytokines. SpeB, the most abundant streptococcal extracellular protein, is a cysteine protease. Pyrogenic exotoxins are implicated as the causative agent of scarlet fever and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. There is no consensus on the exact number of pyrogenic exotoxins."
Renal Pelvis Cancer,"Hematuria, flank pain, urinary frequency","The renal pelvis or pelvis of the kidney is the funnel-like dilated part of the ureter in the kidney. It is formed by the convergence of the major calyces, acting as a funnel for urine flowing from the major calyces to the ureter. It has a mucous membrane and is covered with transitional epithelium and an underlying lamina propria of loose-to-dense connective tissue.
The renal pelvis is situated within the renal sinus alongside the other structures of the renal sinus.


== Clinical significance ==
The renal pelvis is the location of several kinds of kidney cancer and is affected by infection in pyelonephritis."
Hepatitis A,"Pain in the liver area, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, fatigue, loss of appetite, decreased appetite, aversion to oily food, jaundice","Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue. Some people or animals with hepatitis have no symptoms, whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hepatitis is acute if it resolves within six months, and chronic if it lasts longer than six months. Acute hepatitis can resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or (rarely) result in acute liver failure. Chronic hepatitis may progress to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer."
Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH),"Hydrocephalus, abnormal gait, urinary incontinence, nystagmus, unstable gait, and apathetic personality","Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), also called malresorptive hydrocephalus, is a form of communicating hydrocephalus in which excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) builds up in the ventricles, leading to normal or slightly elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure. The fluid build-up causes the ventricles to enlarge and the pressure inside the head to increase, compressing surrounding brain tissue and leading to neurological complications. Although the cause of idiopathic (also referred to as primary) NPH remains unclear, it has been associated with various co-morbidities including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, and hyperlipidemia. Causes of secondary NPH include trauma, hemorrhage, or infection. The disease presents in a classic triad of symptoms, which are memory impairment, urinary frequency, and balance problems/gait deviations (note: this diagnosis method is obsolete)."
Pediatric Germ Cell Tumors,"Abdominal pain, increased abdominal girth, cystic mass","A germ cell tumor (GCT) is a neoplasm derived from primordial germ cells. Germ-cell tumors can be cancerous or benign. Germ cell tumors typically originate from  the gonads (ovary and testis), but can arise in other areas of the body. Extragonadal GCTs are thought to result from abnormal migration of germ cell precursors during development of the embryo.


== Classification ==

GCTs are classified by their histology, regardless of location in the body."
Reye's Syndrome in Children,"Nausea, vomiting, lethargy, coma","Reye syndrome is a rapidly worsening brain disease. Symptoms of Reye syndrome may include vomiting, personality changes, confusion, seizures, and loss of consciousness. While liver toxicity typically occurs in the syndrome, jaundice usually does not. Death occurs in 2040% of those affected with Reye syndrome, and about a third of those who survive are left with a significant degree of brain damage.
The cause of Reye syndrome is unknown."
Post-traumatic Occlusion of the Internal Carotid Artery,"Sensory disturbances, hemiplegia, hemianopsia, epilepsy and epileptiform seizures, consciousness disorders, brain herniation crisis, somnolence, and amaurosis fugax","Carotid artery dissection is a serious condition in which a tear forms in one of the two main carotid arteries in the neck, allowing blood to enter the artery wall and separate its layers (dissection). This separation can lead to the formation of a blood clot, narrowing of the artery, and restricted blood flow to the brain, potentially resulting in stroke. Symptoms vary depending on the extent and location of the dissection and may include a sudden, severe headache, neck or facial pain, vision changes, a drooping eyelid (Horner's syndrome), and stroke-like symptoms such as weakness or numbness on one side of the body, difficulty speaking, or loss of coordination.
Carotid artery dissection can occur spontaneously or be triggered by trauma, including minor injuries, certain medical conditions, or activities that involve neck movement. It is a leading cause of stroke in young and middle-aged adults."
Pregnancy Complicated by Intestinal Obstruction,"Abdominal pain, bloating, gastrointestinal distension, vomiting, bowel movement disorders, and cessation of flatulence in pregnant women not due to pregnancy.","Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, abdominal distension, and weight loss. Complications outside of the gastrointestinal tract may include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and fatigue. The skin rashes may be due to infections, as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction may occur as a complication of chronic inflammation, and those with the disease are at greater risk of colon cancer and small bowel cancer."
Cerebral Thrombosis in the Elderly,"Dizziness, headache, limb numbness and weakness, paralysis, nausea and vomiting, speech impairment, coma","Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis or cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), is the presence of a blood clot in the dural venous sinuses (which drain blood from the brain), the cerebral veins, or both. Symptoms may include severe headache, visual symptoms, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs on one side of the body, and seizures, which occur in around 40% of patients.
The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses. After confirmation of the diagnosis, investigations may be performed to determine the underlying cause, especially if one is not readily apparent.
Treatment is typically with anticoagulants (medications that suppress blood clotting) such as low molecular weight heparin."
Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus,"Vulvar itching, vulvar skin is white or presents with fissures and ulceration; severe cases may lead to labial adhesion and disappearance, affecting sexual life.","Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease, of unknown cause, which can affect any body part of any person, but has a strong preference for the genitals (penis, vulva), and is also known as balanitis xerotica obliterans when it affects the penis. Lichen sclerosus is not contagious. There is a well-documented increase of skin cancer risk in LS, potentially improvable with treatment. LS in adult age women is normally incurable, although treatment can lessen its effects, and it often gets progressively worse if not treated properly. Most males with mild or intermediate disease, restricted to foreskin or glans, can be cured by either medical or surgical treatment."
Postpartum Urinary Tract Infection,"Frequent urination, urgency, pain during urination, burning sensation at the urethral opening, hematuria","Postpartum infections, also known as childbed fever and puerperal fever, are any bacterial infections of the female reproductive tract following childbirth or miscarriage. Signs and symptoms usually include a fever greater than 38.0 C (100.4 F), chills, lower abdominal pain, and possibly odorous vaginal discharge. It usually occurs after the first 24 hours and within the first ten days following delivery.
The most common infection is that of the uterus and surrounding tissues known as puerperal sepsis, postpartum metritis, or postpartum endometritis. Risk factors include caesarean section (C-section), the presence of certain bacteria such as group B streptococcus in the vagina, premature rupture of membranes, multiple vaginal exams, manual removal of the placenta, and prolonged labour among others."
Hepatic Encephalopathy,"Headache, dizziness, memory impairment, consciousness disturbances, somnolence, stupor, increased intracranial pressure, myoclonus, increased speech, hallucinations, coma","Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is an altered level of consciousness as a result of liver failure. Its onset may be gradual or sudden. Other symptoms may include movement problems, changes in mood, or changes in personality. In the advanced stages, it can result in a coma.
Hepatic encephalopathy can occur in those with acute or chronic liver disease."
Subconjunctival Hemorrhage,Presence of unequally sized bright red spots or patches of bleeding with clear boundaries on the sclera.,"Subconjunctival bleeding, also known as subconjunctival hemorrhage or subconjunctival haemorrhage, is bleeding from a small blood vessel over the whites of the eye. It results in a red spot in the white of the eye. There is generally little to no pain and vision is not affected. Generally only one eye is affected.
Causes can include coughing, vomiting, heavy lifting, straining during acute constipation or the act of ""bearing down"" during childbirth, as these activities can increase the blood pressure in the vascular systems supplying the conjunctiva."
Pregnancy-Related Liver Hematoma and Rupture,"Upper right abdominal pain, tense liver capsule, liver capsular hematoma rupture, peritoneal irritation signs, shifting dullness, and intra-abdominal bleeding","Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. Symptoms commonly include right lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever and decreased appetite. However, approximately 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms. Severe complications of a ruptured appendix include widespread, painful inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall and sepsis.
Appendicitis is primarily caused by a blockage of the hollow portion in the appendix."
Myocardial Infarction in the Young,"Precordial pain, sensation of oppression that may radiate to the shoulder, back, left ring finger or little finger, lower jaw; profuse cold sweat; shortness of breath; palpitations and chest oppression.","A diagnosis of myocardial infarction is created by integrating the history of the presenting illness and physical examination with electrocardiogram findings and cardiac markers (blood tests for heart muscle cell damage). A coronary angiogram allows visualization of narrowings or obstructions on the heart vessels, and therapeutic measures can follow immediately. At autopsy, a pathologist can diagnose a myocardial infarction based on anatomopathological findings.
A chest radiograph and routine blood tests may indicate complications or precipitating causes and are often performed upon arrival to an emergency department. New regional wall motion abnormalities on an echocardiogram are also suggestive of a myocardial infarction."
Hyponatremia in the Elderly,"Weakness, nausea and vomiting, headache and drowsiness, myalgia and spasms, reversible ataxia","Hyponatremia or hyponatraemia is a low concentration of sodium in the blood. It is generally defined as a sodium concentration of less than 135 mmol/L (135 mEq/L), with severe hyponatremia being below 120 mEq/L. Symptoms can be absent, mild or severe. Mild symptoms include a decreased ability to think, headaches, nausea, and poor balance. Severe symptoms include confusion, seizures, and coma; death can ensue.
The causes of hyponatremia are typically classified by a person's body fluid status into low volume, normal volume, or high volume."
Traumatic Epilepsy,"Seizures after injury, foaming at the mouth, upward rolling of the eyes, and convulsions of hands and feet","Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) is a form of acquired epilepsy that results from brain damage caused by physical trauma to the brain (traumatic brain injury, abbreviated TBI). A person with PTE experiences repeated post-traumatic seizures (PTS, seizures that result from TBI) more than a week after the initial injury. PTE is estimated to constitute 5% of all cases of epilepsy and over 20% of cases of acquired epilepsy (in which seizures are caused by an identifiable organic brain condition).
It is not known who will develop epilepsy after TBI and who will not. However, the likelihood that a person will develop PTE is influenced by the severity and type of injury; for example penetrating injuries and those that involve bleeding within the brain confer a higher risk."
Paraphenylenediamine Dermatitis,"Mild erythema, edema, slightly elevated or with a few reddish edematous small papules the size of half a rice grain","Contact dermatitis is a type of acute or chronic inflammation of the skin caused by exposure to chemical or physical agents. Symptoms of contact dermatitis can include itchy or dry skin, a red rash, bumps, blisters, or swelling. These rashes are not contagious or life-threatening, but can be very uncomfortable.
Contact dermatitis results from either exposure to allergens (allergic contact dermatitis), or irritants (irritant contact dermatitis). Allergic contact dermatitis involves a delayed type of hypersensitivity and previous exposure to an allergen to produce a reaction."
Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia,"High fever with chills, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, abscess, myalgia, turbinate hypertrophy, rales, pruritus in the nasal vestibule, pulmonary infection, pustule, nasal vestibular cyst","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common encapsulated, Gram-negative, aerobicfacultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium that can cause disease in plants and animals, including humans. A species of considerable medical importance, P. aeruginosa is a multidrug resistant pathogen recognized for its ubiquity, its intrinsically advanced antibiotic resistance mechanisms, and its association with serious illnesses  hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and various sepsis syndromes. P. aeruginosa is able to selectively inhibit various antibiotics from penetrating its outer membrane - and has high resistance to several antibiotics. According to the World Health Organization P. aeruginosa poses one of the greatest threats to humans in terms of antibiotic resistance.
The organism is considered opportunistic insofar as serious infection often occurs during existing diseases or conditions  most notably cystic fibrosis and traumatic burns."
Viral Myocarditis,"Arrhythmia, fever, diarrhea, heart murmur, palpitations, heart failure, chest tightness, fatigue, dizziness, syncope, cardiac enlargement, bradycardia","Myocarditis is inflammation of the cardiac muscle.

Complications may include heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy or cardiac arrest."
Primary Infantile Glaucoma,"Eye pain, visual impairment, photophobia, and tearing, refractive amblyopia","Primary congenital glaucoma is a rare eye condition that is present at birth or develops early in childhood. It occurs due to improper drainage of the eye's fluids, which leads to increased pressure inside the eye, known as intraocular pressure. This elevated pressure can damage the optic nerve which will result in permanent vision loss.  It is also known as pediatric glaucoma or childhood glaucoma, and was previously known as trabeculodysgenesis or goniodysgenesis.


== Types ==
Primary congenital glaucoma is classified into three subtypes:

true congenital glaucoma, which causes signs of increased intraocular pressure within the first month of life,
infantile glaucoma, which presents between one month and three years, and
juvenile glaucoma, which becomes clinically apparent after three years of age and before age 40."
Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus,"Vulvar itching, vulvar skin is white or presents with fissures and ulceration; severe cases may lead to labial adhesion and disappearance, affecting sexual life.","Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease, of unknown cause, which can affect any body part of any person, but has a strong preference for the genitals (penis, vulva), and is also known as balanitis xerotica obliterans when it affects the penis. Lichen sclerosus is not contagious. There is a well-documented increase of skin cancer risk in LS, potentially improvable with treatment. LS in adult age women is normally incurable, although treatment can lessen its effects, and it often gets progressively worse if not treated properly. Most males with mild or intermediate disease, restricted to foreskin or glans, can be cured by either medical or surgical treatment."
"Acute Granulocytic Leukemia, Subtype with Partial Differentiation","Bleeding, anemia, jaundice, bone pain","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal cells that build up in the bone marrow and blood and interfere with normal blood cell production. Symptoms may include feeling tired, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. Occasionally, spread may occur to the brain, skin, or gums. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly, and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.
Risk factors include getting older, being male, smoking, previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy, myelodysplastic syndrome, and exposure to the chemical benzene."
Pediatric Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML),"Anemia, joint pain, palpitations, skin and mucosal bleeding, shortness of breath, nosebleeds, gum bleeding","Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML, APL) is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a cancer of the white blood cells. In APL, there is an abnormal accumulation of immature granulocytes called promyelocytes.  The disease is characterized by a t(15;17) chromosomal translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) gene and is distinguished from other forms of AML by its responsiveness to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; also known as tretinoin) therapy. Acute promyelocytic leukemia was first characterized in 1957 by French and Norwegian physicians as a hyperacute fatal illness, with a median survival time of less than a week. Today, prognoses have drastically improved; 10-year survival rates are estimated to be approximately 80-90% according to one study."
Colorectal Carcinoid,"Diarrhea, watery stool or diarrhea, abdominal pain, edema, tachycardia, chest pain, asthma, episodic skin flushing","Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as bowel cancer, colon cancer, or rectal cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine). Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, abdominal pain and fatigue. Most colorectal cancers are due to lifestyle factors and genetic disorders. Risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red meat, processed meat, and alcohol."
Metastatic Pleural Tumor,"Weight loss, general malaise, anorexia, pleural effusion, chest pain","Metastasis is a pathogenic agent's spreading from an initial or primary site to a different or secondary site within the host's body; the term is typically used when referring to metastasis by a cancerous tumor.  The newly pathological sites, then, are metastases (mets). It is generally distinguished from cancer invasion, which is the direct extension and penetration by cancer cells into neighboring tissues.
Cancer occurs after cells are genetically altered to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. This uncontrolled proliferation by mitosis produces a primary heterogeneic tumour."
Suprasellar Germ Cell Tumor,"Increased intracranial pressure, local symptoms, and abnormal sexual development","A germinoma is a type of germ-cell tumor, which is not differentiated upon examination. It may be benign or malignant.


== Cause ==
Germinomas are thought to originate from an error of development, when certain primordial germ cells fail to migrate properly.  Germinomas lack histologic differentiation, whereas nongerminomatous germ-cell tumors display a variety of differentiation.  Like other germ-cell tumors, germinomas can undergo malignant transformation."
Oral Tuberculous Ulcer,"Ulcers commonly occur near the pharynx, posterior to the molars, and on the cheeks, accompanied by pain, fever, and poor general health and appetite.","Peritonitis is inflammation of the localized or generalized peritoneum, the lining of the inner wall of the abdomen and covering of the abdominal organs. Symptoms may include severe pain, swelling of the abdomen, fever, or weight loss. One part or the entire abdomen may be tender. Complications may include shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Causes include perforation of the intestinal tract, pancreatitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, stomach ulcer, cirrhosis, a ruptured appendix or even a perforated gallbladder."

Lowe syndrome can be considered a cause of Fanconi syndrome (bicarbonaturia, renal tubular acidosis, potassium loss and sodium loss).


== Signs and symptoms ==
Boys with Lowe syndrome are born with cataracts in both eyes; glaucoma is present in about half of the individuals with Lowe syndrome, though usually not at birth. While not present at birth, kidney problems develop in many affected boys at about one year of age. Renal pathology is characterized by an abnormal loss of certain substances into the urine, including bicarbonate, sodium, potassium, amino acids, organic acids, albumin, calcium and L-carnitine."
Orbital Metastatic Tumor,"Eye pain, epiphora, eyelid swelling with a pale green color, eye muscle paralysis, periorbital edema, red eye, and inability to move the eyeball voluntarily","An eye neoplasm is a tumor of the eye. A rare type of tumor, eye neoplasms can affect all parts of the eye, and can either be benign or malignant (cancerous), in which case it is known as eye cancer. Eye cancers can be primary (starts within the eye) or metastatic cancer (spread to the eye from another organ). The two most common cancers that spread to the eye from another organ are breast cancer and lung cancer. Other less common sites of origin include the prostate, kidney, thyroid, skin, colon and blood or bone marrow."
Neonatal Atelectasis,"High fever, cyanosis, chest pain, palpitations, abnormal breathing, rapid but weak pulse, fever, elevated diaphragm","Positive airway pressure (PAP) is a mode of respiratory ventilation used in the treatment of sleep apnea. PAP ventilation is also commonly used for those who are critically ill in hospital with respiratory failure, in newborn infants (neonates), and for the prevention and treatment of atelectasis in patients with difficulty taking deep breaths. In these patients, PAP ventilation can prevent the need for tracheal intubation, or allow earlier extubation. Sometimes patients with neuromuscular diseases use this variety of ventilation as well. CPAP is an acronym for ""continuous positive airway pressure"", which was developed by Dr."
Pediatric Myocarditis,"Fatigue, pallor, cyanosis around the mouth and nose, restlessness, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest tightness, excessive sweating in hands and feet, trembling in hands and feet, pathological Q wave, bradycardia, chest pain accompanied by chest tightness, palpitations","Cardiomyopathy is a group of primary diseases of the heart muscle. Early on there may be few or no symptoms. As the disease worsens, shortness of breath, feeling tired, and swelling of the legs may occur, due to the onset of heart failure. An irregular heart beat and fainting may occur. Those affected are at an increased risk of sudden cardiac death."
Myocardial Infarction with Ventricular Septal Rupture,"Cardiac structural abnormalities, interventricular septal defect, bradycardia, heart failure, left chest pain, right ventricular outflow tract, cardiac rupture, anterior chest discomfort, sudden pain, left ventricular hypertrophy, angina pectoris, abnormal respiration","Myocardial rupture is a laceration of the ventricles or atria of the heart, of the interatrial or interventricular septum, or of the papillary muscles.  It is most commonly seen as a serious sequela of an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack).
It can also be caused by trauma.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms of myocardial rupture are recurrent or persistent chest pain, syncope, and distension of jugular vein. Sudden death caused by a myocardial rupture is sometimes preceded by no symptoms."
Ito's Nevus,"Maculopapular rash, pigmented patches, light brown spots","Nevus (pl.: nevi) is a nonspecific medical term for a visible, circumscribed, chronic lesion of the skin or mucosa. The term originates from nvus, which is Latin for ""birthmark""; however, a nevus can be either congenital (present at birth) or acquired. Common terms, including mole, birthmark, and beauty mark, are used to describe nevi, but these terms do not distinguish specific types of nevi from one another.


== Classification ==
The term nevus is applied to a number of conditions caused by neoplasias and hyperplasias of melanocytes, as well as a number of pigmentation disorders, both hypermelanotic (containing increased melanin, the pigment responsible for skin color) and hypomelanotic (containing decreased melanin). Suspicious skin moles which are multi-colored or pink may be a finding in skin cancer."
Acute Left-Sided Heart Failure,"Heart failure, orthopnea, syncope, shock, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, pallor, cyanosis, wheezing, limb convulsions, pulsus alternans, abnormal breathing","Heart failure (HF), also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), is a syndrome caused by an impairment in the heart's ability to fill with and pump blood.
Although symptoms vary based on which side of the heart is affected, HF typically presents with shortness of breath, excessive fatigue, and bilateral leg swelling. The severity of the heart failure is mainly decided based on ejection fraction and also measured by the severity of symptoms. Other conditions that have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver disease, anemia, and thyroid disease.
Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excessive alcohol consumption, infection, and cardiomyopathy."
Allergic Vasculitis and Granulomatosis,"Nasal congestion, bloody mucopurulent nasal discharge, wheezing","Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), formerly known as  allergic granulomatosis, is an extremely rare autoimmune condition that causes inflammation of small and medium-sized blood vessels (vasculitis) in persons with a history of airway allergic hypersensitivity (atopy).
It usually manifests in three stages. The early (prodromal) stage is marked by airway inflammation; almost all patients experience asthma and/or allergic rhinitis. The second stage is characterized by abnormally high numbers of eosinophils (hypereosinophilia), which causes tissue damage, most commonly to the lungs and the digestive tract. The third stage consists of vasculitis, which can eventually lead to cell death and can be life-threatening."
Ectropion,Eyelid eversion,"Ectropion is a medical condition in which the lower eyelid turns outwards. It is one of the notable aspects of newborns exhibiting congenital harlequin-type ichthyosis, but ectropion can occur due to any weakening of tissue of the lower eyelid. The condition can be repaired surgically. Ectropion is also found in dogs as an inherited, developmental condition.


== Causes ==
Congenital
Aging
Scarring
Mechanical
Allergic
Facial nerve palsy
Anti-cancer treatments such as erlotinib, cetuximab, and panitumumab, which block the function of EGFR (the epidermal growth factor receptor)."
Spinal Hemorrhage,"Paraplegia, quadriplegia, decreased muscle tone, absence of tendon reflexes, respiratory failure, urinary retention, spinal compression, spinal bleeding, referred pain, internal bleeding, spinal compression, paralysis","Spinal cord stroke is a rare type of stroke with compromised blood flow to any region of spinal cord owing to occlusion or bleeding, leading to irreversible neuronal death. It can be classified into two types, ischaemia and haemorrhage, in which the former accounts for 86% of all cases, a pattern similar to cerebral stroke. The disease is either arisen spontaneously from aortic illnesses or postoperatively. It deprives patients of motor function or sensory function, and sometimes both. Infarction usually occurs in regions perfused by anterior spinal artery, which spans the anterior two-thirds of spinal cord."
Congenital Atransferrinemia,"Pale complexion, fatigue, palpitations, cardiac murmur, hepatomegaly, recurrent infections, delayed growth and development","Atransferrinemia is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder in which there is an absence of transferrin, a plasma protein that transports iron through the blood.
Atransferrinemia is characterized by anemia and hemosiderosis in the heart and liver. The iron damage to the heart can lead to heart failure. The anemia is typically microcytic and hypochromic (the red blood cells are abnormally small and pale). Atransferrinemia was first described in 1961 and is extremely rare, with only ten documented cases worldwide."
Urethral Tuberculosis,"Hematuria, difficulty urinating and urinary retention, bloody urine, urinary tract obstruction, cloudy urine, urinary retention, absence of active tuberculous lesions, urinary frequency accompanied by urgency and dysuria, urine leakage, dysuria, hematuria, turbid urine","Hematospermia (also known as haematospermia, hemospermia, or haemospermia) is the presence of blood in the ejaculate. It is most often a benign symptom. Among men age 40 or older, hematospermia is a slight predictor of cancer, typically prostate cancer. No specific cause is found in up to 70% of cases.


== Cause ==
Though haematospermia may cause considerable distress to patients, it is often a benign and self-limiting condition caused by infections, particularly in younger patients."
Breast Eczema,"Vesicles, papules, nipple erosion, eczema, nipple eczema, nipple fissures","The term breast eczema refers to benign dermatitis seen in the skin of the breast. It can affect the nipples, areolae, and surrounding areas.
Eczema of the nipples is the moist type, with oozing and crusting. Painful fissuring is frequently seen, especially in nursing mothers.:78 It will often occur in pregnancy, even without breastfeeding.
Persistent eczema of the nipple, especially in the middle-aged and elderly, should be discussed with a doctor, as a rare type of breast cancer called Paget's disease can cause similar symptoms."
Seborrheic Keratosis,"Papules, oily scales","A seborrheic keratosis is a non-cancerous (benign) skin tumour that originates from cells, namely keratinocytes, in the outer layer of the skin called the epidermis. Like liver spots, seborrheic keratoses are seen more often as people age.
The tumours (also called lesions) appear in various colours, from light tan to black. They are round or oval, feel flat or slightly elevated, like the scab from a healing wound, and range in size from very small to more than 2.5 centimetres (1 in) across. They are often associated with other skin conditions, including basal cell carcinoma."
Paget's Disease of the Breast,"Itching or intense itching of the nipple, burning sensation, followed by redness of the nipple and areola skin, presence of yellowish-brown scaly crusts, revealing slight skin erosion under the crust, presenting as chronic eczematous changes.","Paget's disease of the breast (also known as mammary Paget's disease) is a rare skin change at the nipple nearly always associated with underlying breast cancer. Paget's disease of the breast was first described by Sir James Paget in 1874. The condition is an uncommon disease accounting for 1 to 4% of all breast cancers cases. 92% to 100% of patients with Paget's disease of the breast have an underlying breast cancer.
The condition in itself often appears innocuous, limited to a surface appearance and it is sometimes dismissed, although it is actually indicative of underlying breast cancer."
Superior Mesenteric Vein Thrombosis,"Constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloody stool, abdominal discomfort, lower abdominal rebound pain, abdominal tenderness, absence of bowel sounds, abdominal distention, fever, vomiting","In human anatomy, the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) is a blood vessel that drains blood from the small intestine (jejunum and ileum). Behind the neck of the pancreas, the superior mesenteric vein combines with the splenic vein to form the portal vein that carries blood to the liver. The superior mesenteric vein lies to the right of the similarly named artery, the superior mesenteric artery, which originates from the abdominal aorta.


== Structure ==
Tributaries of the superior mesenteric vein drain the small intestine, large intestine, stomach, pancreas and appendix and include:

Right gastro-omental vein (also known as the right gastro-epiploic vein)
inferior pancreaticoduodenal veins
veins from jejunum
veins from ileum
middle colic vein  drains the transverse colon
right colic vein  drains the ascending colon
ileocolic vein
The superior mesenteric vein combines with the splenic vein to form the portal vein.


== Clinical significance ==
Thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein is quite rare, but a significant cause of mesenteric ischemia and can be fatal."
Arteriovenous Hemangioma,Proliferation of thick-walled and thin-walled blood vessels within the dermis,"Cherry angioma, also called cherry hemangioma or Campbell de Morgan Spot, is a small bright red dome-shaped bump on the skin. It ranges between 0.5 and 6 mm in diameter and usually several are present, typically on the chest and arms, and increasing in number with age. If scratched, they may bleed.
They are a harmless benign tumour, containing an abnormal proliferation of blood vessels, and have no relationship to cancer. They are the most common kind of angioma, and increase with age, occurring in nearly all adults over 30 years."
Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB),"Generally, there are no obvious symptoms or signs.","Left bundle branch block (LBBB) is a conduction abnormality in the heart that can be seen on an electrocardiogram (ECG). In this condition, activation of the left ventricle of the heart is delayed, which causes the left ventricle to contract later than the right ventricle.


== Causes ==
Among the causes of LBBB are:

Aortic stenosis
Dilated cardiomyopathy
Acute myocardial infarction
Extensive coronary artery disease
Primary disease of the cardiac electrical conduction system
Long standing hypertension leading to aortic root dilatation and subsequent aortic regurgitation
Lyme disease


== Mechanisms ==
Slow or absent conduction through the left bundle branch means that it takes longer than normal for the left ventricle to fully depolarise.  This can be due to a damaged bundle branch that is completely unable to conduct, but may represent intact conduction that is slower than normal.  LBBB may be fixed, present at all times, but may be intermittent for example occurring only during rapid heart rates."
Pigmentary Glaucoma,"Red color blindness, juvenile cataract, irregular pupil size, pigment anomaly, pupil deformation, 'chicken blindness' or nyctalopia","Pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) is an  eye disorder that can lead to a form of glaucoma known as pigmentary glaucoma. It takes place when pigment cells slough off from the back of the iris and float around in the aqueous humor. Over time, these pigment cells can accumulate in the anterior chamber in such a way that they begin to clog the trabecular meshwork (the major site of aqueous humour drainage), which can in turn prevent the aqueous humour from draining and therefore increases the pressure inside the eye. A common finding in PDS are central, vertical corneal endothelial pigment deposits, known as Krukenberg spindle. With PDS, the intraocular pressure tends to spike at times and then can return to normal."
Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome,"Vomiting, loss of appetite, weight loss, bloating, colic, malnutrition, anemia, abdominal pain","Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome is a gastro-vascular disorder in which the third and final portion of the duodenum is compressed between the abdominal aorta (AA) and the overlying superior mesenteric artery.  This rare, potentially life-threatening syndrome is typically caused by an angle of 625 between the AA and the SMA, in comparison to the normal range of 3856, due to a lack of retroperitoneal and visceral fat (mesenteric fat). In addition, the aortomesenteric distance is 28 millimeters, as opposed to the typical 1020. However, a narrow SMA angle alone is not enough to make a diagnosis, because patients with a low BMI, most notably children, have been known to have a narrow SMA angle with no symptoms of SMA syndrome.
SMA syndrome is also known as Wilkie's syndrome, cast syndrome, mesenteric root syndrome, chronic duodenal ileus and intermittent arterio-mesenteric occlusion."
Poliomyelitis,"General muscle and skeletal pain, skin hypersensitivity, somnolence, disappearance of tendon reflexes, muscle atrophy, muscle pain, cramps","Poliomyelitis ( POH-lee-oh-MY--LY-tiss), commonly shortened to polio, is an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus. Approximately 75% of cases are asymptomatic; mild symptoms which can occur include sore throat and fever; in a proportion of cases more severe symptoms develop such as headache, neck stiffness, and paresthesia. These symptoms usually pass within one or two weeks. A less common symptom is permanent paralysis, and possible death in extreme cases. Years after recovery, post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to what the person had during the initial infection."
Benign Pulmonary Tumor,"Cough, hoarse cough, hemoptysis, chest tightness, blood-streaked sputum, fatigue","A benign tumor is a mass of cells (tumor) that does not invade neighboring tissue or metastasize (spread throughout the body). Compared to malignant (cancerous) tumors, benign tumors generally have a slower growth rate. Benign tumors have relatively well differentiated cells. They are often surrounded by an outer surface (fibrous sheath of connective tissue) or stay contained within the epithelium. Common examples of benign tumors include moles and uterine fibroids."
Malignant Mastocytoma,"Wheezing, difficulty breathing, fever, irritability","A mastocytoma in dogs (or mast cell tumor in dogs) is a neoplasm (neoplasia) originating from mast cells in the domestic dog, which occurs mainly in the skin and subcutis. Mastocytoma are not only extremely common in dogs, but also tend to be much more malignant in them than in other animal species. The average survival time for malignant tumors is only four months, whereas for benign tumors it is over two years.

Mast cells are cells of the immune system that play a role in the innate immune response. They produce a number of biologically active substances, including primarily histamine."
Cholesteatoma,"Headache, dizziness, decreased vision","Cholesteatoma is a destructive and expanding growth consisting of keratinizing squamous epithelium in the middle ear and/or mastoid process. Cholesteatomas are not cancerous as the name may suggest, but can cause significant problems because of their erosive and expansile properties. This can result in the destruction of the bones of the middle ear (ossicles), as well as growth through the base of the skull into the brain. They often become infected and can result in chronically draining ears. Treatment almost always consists of surgical removal."
Acute Tracheobronchitis,"Nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, cough with expectoration, frothy sputum, and difficulty breathing","Bordetella bronchiseptica is a small, gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium of the genus Bordetella. It can cause infectious bronchitis in dogs and other animals, but rarely infects humans. Closely related to B. pertussisthe obligate human pathogen that causes pertussis (whooping cough); B. bronchiseptica can persist in the environment for extended periods.


== Pathogenesis ==
Humans are not natural carriers of B. bronchiseptica, which typically infects the respiratory tracts of smaller mammals (cats, dogs, rabbits, etc.). People are more likely to be infected by B. pertussis or B. parapertussis."
Dermatomyositis without Myopathy,"Periorbital edema and violaceous rash, dilated capillaries at the nail folds, erythema on exposed areas of the skin","Inflammatory myopathy, also known as idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM), is disease featuring muscle weakness, inflammation of muscles (myositis), and in some types, muscle pain (myalgia). The cause of much inflammatory myopathy is unknown (idiopathic), and such cases are classified according to their symptoms and signs, electromyography, MRI, and laboratory findings. It can also be associated with underlying cancer. The main classes of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy are polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM) (including juvenile, amyopathic, and sine-dermatitis form), inclusion-body myositis (IBM), immune-mediated necrotising myopathy (IMNM), and focal autoimmune myositis.


== Diagnosis ==
Idiopathic inflammatory myopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion."
Aortic Valve Stenosis with Insufficiency,"Systolic tremor, precordial bulging, palpitations, increased pulmonary blood flow, rapid pulse, valvulopathy, respiratory abnormalities, increased pacing rate, bruits of femoral arteries, cyanosis, annular constriction of the ascending aorta root, rupture of the aortic sinus","Aortic stenosis (AS or AoS) is the narrowing  of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aorta begins), such that problems result. It may occur at the aortic valve as well as above and below this level. It typically gets worse over time. Symptoms often come on gradually with a decreased ability to exercise often occurring first. If heart failure, loss of consciousness, or heart related chest pain occur due to AS the outcomes are worse."
Recurrent Cervical Cancer,"Pain and swelling in the affected lower limb, sacroiliac (or hip) pain, lower back pain, lower abdominal pain, difficulty in urination and defecation","Cervical cancer is a cancer arising from the cervix or in any layer of the wall of the cervix. It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that can invade or spread to other parts of the body. Early on, typically no symptoms are seen. Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain or pain during sexual intercourse. While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer."
Tuberculous Pericarditis,"Cough, chest pain, swelling of the lower limbs, palpitations, dyspnea, loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, enlarged liver",Tuberculous pericarditis is a form of pericarditis. It is a condition in which the pericardium surrounding the heart is infected by the bacterial species Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tuberculous pericarditis accounts for a significant percentage of presentations of tuberculosis worldwide. The condition has four stages of disease which manifests with clinical presentations ranging from acute pericarditis to overt heart failure. Tuberculous pericarditis is an under-diagnosed condition.
Malignant Lymphoma,"Lymph nodes in superficial locations exhibit painless and progressive enlargement with a smooth surface, tough texture, and firmness akin to a ping-pong ball or the hardness of a nose tip. As lymphoma is a systemic disease, besides the aforementioned local symptoms, approximately half of the patients may also exhibit systemic symptoms, including fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, loss of appetite, skin rashes, itching, anemia, and others.","Lymphoma is a group of blood and lymph tumors that develop from lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). The name typically refers to just the cancerous versions rather than all such tumours. Signs and symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, drenching sweats, unintended weight loss, itching, and constantly feeling tired. The enlarged lymph nodes are usually painless. The sweats are most common at night."
Summer Heat Syndrome,"Prolonged fever, excessive thirst and drinking, polyuria, anhidrosis","Hyperthermia, also known simply as overheating, is a condition in which an individual's body temperature is elevated beyond normal due to failed thermoregulation. The person's body produces or absorbs more heat than it dissipates. When extreme temperature elevation occurs, it becomes a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment to prevent disability or death. Almost half a million deaths are recorded every year from hyperthermia.
The most common causes include heat stroke and adverse reactions to drugs."
Renal Cancer in the Elderly,"Hematuria, pain, and a mass","Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a kidney cancer that originates in the lining of the proximal convoluted tubule, a part of the very small tubes in the kidney that transport primary urine. RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults, responsible for approximately 9095% of cases. It is more common in men (with a male-to-female ratio of up to 2:1). It is most commonly diagnosed in the elderly (especially in people over 75 years of age).
Initial treatment is most commonly either partial or complete removal of the affected kidney(s)."
Lupus-Induced Psychosis,"Depression, hallucinations, obsessive thoughts, psychotic disorders","In psychopathology, psychosis is a condition in which a person is unable to distinguish between what is and is not real. Examples of psychotic symptoms are delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized or incoherent thoughts or speech. Psychosis is a description of a person's state or symptoms, rather than a particular mental illness, and it is not related to psychopathy (a personality construct characterized by impaired empathy and remorse, along with bold, disinhibited, and egocentric traits).
Common causes of chronic (i.e. ongoing or repeating) psychosis include schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and brain damage (usually as a result of alcoholism)."
Viral Meningitis,"Fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, sore throat, general weakness, stiff neck, meningeal irritation signs","Viral meningitis, also known as aseptic meningitis, is a type of meningitis due to a viral infection. It results in inflammation of the meninges (the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord). Symptoms commonly include headache, fever, sensitivity to light and neck stiffness. 
Viruses are the most common cause of aseptic meningitis. Most cases of viral meningitis are caused by enteroviruses (common stomach viruses)."
Type I Immune Medullary Lymphadenopathy,"Fever, lymphadenopathy, skin lesions, radiculoneuritis, muscle weakness","A lymph node, or lymph gland, is a kidney-shaped organ of the lymphatic system and the adaptive immune system. A large number of lymph nodes are linked throughout the body by the lymphatic vessels. They are major sites of lymphocytes that include B and T cells. Lymph nodes are important for the proper functioning of the immune system, acting as filters for foreign particles including cancer cells, but have no detoxification function.
In the lymphatic system, a lymph node is a secondary lymphoid organ."
Myxofibrosarcoma,"Nodules, semicircular elevation of the hard palate","Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS), although a rare type of tumor, is one of the most common soft tissue sarcomas, i.e. cancerous tumors, that develop in the soft tissues of elderly individuals. Initially considered to be a type of histiocytoma termed fibrous histiocytoma or myxoid variant of malignant fibrous histiocytoma, Angervall et al. termed this tumor myxofibrosarcoma in 1977. In 2020, the World Health Organization reclassified MFS as a separate and distinct tumor in the category of malignant fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors."
Fatty Liver,"Liver enlargement, fatigue, weight loss, nausea and vomiting, abnormal appetite, pain in the upper right abdomen, abnormal blood lipids","Fatty liver disease (FLD), also known as hepatic steatosis and steatotic liver disease (SLD), is a condition where excess fat builds up in the liver. Often there are no or few symptoms. Occasionally there may be tiredness or pain in the upper right side of the abdomen. Complications may include cirrhosis, liver cancer, and esophageal varices.
The main subtypes of fatty liver disease are metabolic dysfunctionassociated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, formerly ""non-alcoholic fatty liver disease"" (NAFLD)) and alcoholic liver disease (ALD), with the category ""metabolic and alcohol associated liver disease"" (metALD) describing an overlap of the two."
Secondary Cutaneous CD30+ Large T-Cell Lymphoma,"Lymphatic metastasis, persistent cyanosis after birth, enlargement of the supraclavicular and anterior scalene lymph nodes","Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a class of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is a type of cancer of the immune system.  Unlike most non-Hodgkin lymphomas (which are generally B-cell-related), CTCL is caused by a mutation of T cells.  The cancerous T cells in the body initially migrate to the skin, causing various lesions to appear.  These lesions change shape as the disease progresses, typically beginning as what appears to be a rash which can be very itchy and eventually forming plaques and tumors before spreading to other parts of the body.


== Signs and symptoms ==
The presentation depends if it is mycosis fungoides or Szary syndrome, the most common, though not the only types."
Pediatric Acute Respiratory Failure,"Rapid breathing, difficulty breathing, cyanosis, irritability, somnolence, hematemesis, bleeding, oliguria or anuria, convulsions, arrhythmia","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a type of respiratory failure characterized by rapid onset of widespread inflammation in the lungs. Symptoms include shortness of breath (dyspnea), rapid breathing (tachypnea), and bluish skin coloration (cyanosis). For those who survive, a decreased quality of life is common.
Causes may include sepsis, pancreatitis, trauma, pneumonia, and aspiration. The underlying mechanism involves diffuse injury to cells which form the barrier of the microscopic air sacs of the lungs, surfactant dysfunction, activation of the immune system, and dysfunction of the body's regulation of blood clotting."
Sarcoma Skin Metastasis,"Nodules, ulcers, skin metastasis, implantation nodules, endometriosis","Metastasis is a pathogenic agent's spreading from an initial or primary site to a different or secondary site within the host's body; the term is typically used when referring to metastasis by a cancerous tumor.  The newly pathological sites, then, are metastases (mets). It is generally distinguished from cancer invasion, which is the direct extension and penetration by cancer cells into neighboring tissues.
Cancer occurs after cells are genetically altered to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. This uncontrolled proliferation by mitosis produces a primary heterogeneic tumour."
Bladder leiomyosarcoma,"Gross hematuria, urinary frequency, and difficulty urinating, which progressively worsen","A leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a rare malignant (cancerous) smooth muscle tumor. The word is from  leio- 'smooth'  myo- 'muscle' and  sarcoma 'tumor of connective tissue'. The stomach, bladder, uterus, blood vessels, and intestines are examples of hollow organs made up of smooth muscles where LMS can be located; however, the uterus and abdomen are the most common sites.
Although leiomyosarcomas are rare, they belong to the more common types of soft-tissue sarcoma, representing 1020% of new cases. This type of cancer is more frequently diagnosed in adults as compared to children."
Shigellosis,"Chills, fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, tenesmus, mucopurulent bloody stools, seizures, headache, and general muscle soreness","Shigellosis, known historically as dysentery, is an infection of the intestines caused by Shigella bacteria. Symptoms generally start one to two days after exposure and include diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, and feeling the need to pass stools even when the bowels are empty. The diarrhea may be bloody. Symptoms typically last five to seven days and it may take several months before bowel habits return entirely to normal. Complications can include reactive arthritis, sepsis, seizures, and hemolytic uremic syndrome."
Heatstroke,"Hyperthermia, hypertension, respiratory failure, mental disorders, heat exhaustion, abnormal sweating, reduced or absent tear, saliva, and sweat secretion, persistent fever, general debilitation, heat cramps","Heat stroke or heatstroke, also known as sun-stroke, is a severe heat illness that results in a body temperature greater than 40.0 C (104.0 F), along with red skin, headache, dizziness, and confusion. Sweating is generally present in exertional heatstroke, but not in classic heatstroke. The start of heat stroke can be sudden or gradual. Heatstroke is a life-threatening condition due to the potential for multi-organ dysfunction, with typical complications including seizures, rhabdomyolysis, or kidney failure.
Heat stroke occurs because of high external temperatures and/or physical exertion."
Spinal Cord Gunshot Wounds,"Thoracolumbar spine injury, ataxia, sensory disturbances, arrhythmias, hemoptysis, fever, coma, pulselessness, flexor spastic paraplegia, epilepsy and epileptiform seizures, paralysis","A gunshot wound (GSW) is a penetrating injury caused by a projectile (e.g. a bullet) shot from a gun (typically a firearm). Damage may include bleeding, bone fractures, organ damage, wound infection, and loss of the ability to move part of the body. Damage depends on the part of the body hit, the path the bullet follows through (or into) the body, and the type and speed of the bullet. In severe cases, although not uncommon, the injury is fatal."
Lymphoma,"Abnormal appetite, lymphadenopathy, localized lymph node enlargement","Lymphoma is a group of blood and lymph tumors that develop from lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). The name typically refers to just the cancerous versions rather than all such tumours. Signs and symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, drenching sweats, unintended weight loss, itching, and constantly feeling tired. The enlarged lymph nodes are usually painless. The sweats are most common at night."
Neuroblastoma,"Fever, anemia, wasting, periorbital ecchymosis, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, fever, joint pain, and dyspnea","Neuroblastoma (NB) is a type of cancer that forms in certain types of nerve tissue. It most frequently starts from one of the adrenal glands but can also develop in the head, neck, chest, abdomen, or spine. Symptoms may include bone pain, a lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest, or a painless bluish lump under the skin.
Typically, neuroblastoma occurs due to a genetic mutation occurring in the first trimester of pregnancy. Rarely, it may be due to a mutation inherited."
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor (GIST),"Gastrointestinal bleeding, difficulty swallowing, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, liver metastasis","Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal neoplasms of the gastrointestinal tract. GISTs arise in the smooth muscle pacemaker interstitial cell of Cajal, or similar cells. They are defined as tumors whose behavior is driven by mutations in the KIT gene (85%),  PDGFRA gene (10%), or BRAF kinase (rare). 95% of GISTs  stain positively for KIT (CD117).  Most (66%) occur in the stomach and gastric GISTs have a lower malignant potential than tumors found elsewhere in the GI tract."
Vulvar Yolk Sac Tumor,"Painless, hard, mobile masses with tenderness, skin ulceration, and cellulitis-like changes","Vulvar tumors are those neoplasms of the vulva. Vulvar and vaginal neoplasms make up a small percentage (3%) of female genital cancers. They can be benign or malignant (vulvar cancer). Vulvar neoplasms are divided into cystic or solid lesions and other mixed types. Vulvar cancers are those malignant neoplasms that originate from vulvar epithelium, while vulvar sarcomas develop from non-epithelial cells such as bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, blood vessels, or other connective or supportive tissue."
Ectopic Esophageal Tissue,"Difficulty swallowing, respiratory distress, nausea, pendulum sign, esophageal spasm, coughing chokes, cyanosis","Squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC),  also known as epidermoid carcinoma, comprises a number of different types of cancer that begin in squamous cells. These cells form on the surface of the skin, on the lining of hollow organs in the body, and on the lining of the respiratory and digestive tracts.
The squamous-cell carcinomas of different body sites can show differences in their presented symptoms, natural history, prognosis, and response to treatment.


== By body location ==
Human papillomavirus infection has been associated with SCCs of the oropharynx, lung, fingers, and anogenital region.


=== Head and neck cancer ===

About 90% of cases of head and neck cancer (cancer of the mouth, nasal cavity, nasopharynx, throat and associated structures) are due to SCC.


=== Skin ===
Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma is the second most common skin cancer, accounting for over 1 million cases in the United States each year."
Primary Bone Lymphoma,"Bone pain, fatigue, fever, muscle soreness","Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), also known as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, is a group of blood cancers that includes all types of lymphomas except Hodgkin lymphomas. Symptoms include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and tiredness. Other symptoms may include bone pain, chest pain, or itchiness. Some forms are slow-growing while others are fast-growing. Unlike Hodgkin lymphoma, which spreads contiguously, NHL is largely a systemic illness."
Hereditary Factor V Deficiency,"Purpura, nosebleeds, bleeding gums, heavy menstrual bleeding, prolonged bleeding after tooth extraction, postpartum hemorrhage, hematuria, anemia","Coagulation factor V (Factor V), also less commonly known as proaccelerin or labile factor, is a protein involved in coagulation, encoded, in humans, by F5 gene. In contrast to most other coagulation factors, it is not enzymatically active but functions as a cofactor. Factor V deficiency leads to predisposition for hemorrhage, while some mutations (most notably factor V Leiden) predispose for thrombosis.


== Genetics ==
The gene for factor V is located on the first chromosome (1q24). It is genomically related to the family of multicopper oxidases, and is homologous to coagulation factor VIII. The gene spans 70 kb, consists of 25 exons, and the resulting protein has a relative molecular mass of approximately 330kDa."
Pulmonary Embolism,"Acute dyspnea, pulmonary embolism, cyanosis, chest pain, cardiopulmonary embolism, syncope, hemoptysis, right heart failure, cold extremities, pleural friction rub, pleural effusion, panic attacks","Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a blockage of an artery in the lungs by a substance that has moved from elsewhere in the body through the bloodstream (embolism). Symptoms of a PE may include shortness of breath, chest pain particularly upon breathing in, and coughing up blood. Symptoms of a blood clot in the leg may also be present, such as a red, warm, swollen, and painful leg. Signs of a PE include low blood oxygen levels, rapid breathing, rapid heart rate, and sometimes a mild fever. Severe cases can lead to passing out, abnormally low blood pressure, obstructive shock, and sudden death."
Renal Failure,"Nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, restlessness, somnolence, oliguria, anuria, coma","Kidney failure, also known as renal failure or end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is a medical condition in which the kidneys can no longer adequately filter waste products from the blood, functioning at less than 15% of normal levels. Kidney failure is classified as either acute kidney failure, which develops rapidly and may resolve; and chronic kidney failure, which develops slowly and can often be irreversible. Symptoms may include leg swelling, feeling tired, vomiting, loss of appetite, and confusion. Complications of acute and chronic failure include uremia, hyperkalemia, and volume overload. Complications of chronic failure also include heart disease, high blood pressure, and anaemia."
Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia,"Fever, cough, expectoration, chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, leukocytosis, chills","Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a group of gram-positive bacteria that are genetically distinct from other strains of Staphylococcus aureus. MRSA is responsible for several difficult-to-treat infections in humans. It caused more than 100,000 deaths worldwide attributable to antimicrobial resistance in 2019.
MRSA is any strain of S. aureus that has developed (through natural selection) or acquired (through horizontal gene transfer) a multiple drug resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. Beta-lactam (-lactam) antibiotics are a broad-spectrum group that include some penams (penicillin derivatives such as methicillin and oxacillin) and cephems such as the cephalosporins."
Cervical Erosion,"Increased vaginal discharge, vulvar pruritus, lower abdominal heaviness, and bleeding after intercourse","Cervical ectropion is a condition in which the cells from the 'inside' of the cervical canal, known as glandular cells (or columnar epithelium), are present on the 'outside' of the vaginal portion of the cervix. The cells on the 'outside' of the cervix are typically squamous epithelial cells. Where the two cells meet is called the transformation zone, also known as the stratified squamous epithelium. Cervical ectropion can be grossly indistinguishable from early cervical cancer and must be evaluated by a physician to determine risks and prognosis. It may be found incidentally when a vaginal examination (or pap smear test) is done."
Chest Wall Tumor,"Severe persistent localized pain, rapid tumor growth, unclear boundaries, and surface-expanded blood vessels","A Pancoast tumor is a tumor of the apex of the lung. It is a type of lung cancer defined primarily by its location situated at the top end of either the right or left lung. It typically spreads to nearby tissues such as the ribs and vertebrae. Most Pancoast tumors are non-small-cell lung cancers.
The growing tumor can cause compression of many nearby structures, such as the brachiocephalic vein, subclavian artery, phrenic nerve, recurrent laryngeal nerve, vagus nerve, or, characteristically, compression of a sympathetic ganglion (the stellate ganglion), which result in various presenting symptoms, most notably a range of symptoms known as Horner's syndrome due to compression of nearby sympathetic nerves."
Fibrocystic Breast Condition,"Breast fullness and pain, cyclical changes, pale yellow nipple discharge","Fibrocystic breast changes is a condition of the breasts where there may be pain, breast cysts, and breast masses. The breasts may be described as ""lumpy"" or ""doughy"". Symptoms may worsen during certain parts of the menstrual cycle due to hormonal stimulation. These are normal breast changes, not associated with cancer.
Risk factors include an early age at first menstrual period and either having children at a late age or not at all."
Fat Embolism Syndrome,"respiratory failure, coma, fulminant pain, persistent fever, somnolence, fatigue, convulsions, irregular breathing, dyspnea, petechiae","Fat embolism syndrome occurs when fat enters the blood stream (fat embolism) and results in symptoms. Symptoms generally begin within a day. This may include a petechial rash, decreased level of consciousness, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms may include fever and decreased urine output. The risk of death is about 10%."
Strong Acid Poisoning,"Constipation, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, laryngospasm, difficulty breathing, coma, convulsions","Domoic acid (DA) is a kainic acid-type neurotoxin that causes amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP). It is produced by algae and accumulates in shellfish, sardines, and anchovies. When sea lions, otters, cetaceans, humans, and other predators eat contaminated animals, poisoning may result. Exposure to this compound affects the brain, causing seizures, delirium and possibly death.


== History ==
There has been little use of domoic acid throughout history except for in Japan, where it has been used as an anthelmintic for centuries."
Alcoholic Necrosis of the Femoral Head,"Limb weakness, hip joint pain, chronic dull or acute pain, aggravated at night and by exertion, radiating pain to knee joint, inner thigh, groin","Metabolic dysfunctionassociated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a type of chronic liver disease. 
This condition is diagnosed when there is excessive fat build-up in the liver (hepatic steatosis), and at least one metabolic risk factor. When there is also increased alcohol intake, the term MetALD, or metabolic dysfunction and alcohol associated/related liver disease is used, and differentiated from alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) where alcohol is the predominant cause of the steatotic liver disease.  The terms non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, now MASH) have been used to describe different severities, the latter indicating the presence of further liver inflammation. NAFL is less dangerous than NASH and usually does not progress to it, but this progression may eventually lead to complications, such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, liver failure, and cardiovascular disease."
Pulmonary Edema,"Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, cyanosis of lips, pink frothy sputum, persistent generalized edema, increased shadows of pulmonary hila, cough, renal edema, subcutaneous edema, cyanosis, water intoxication, diffuse tympanic sounds","Pulmonary edema (British English: oedema), also known as pulmonary congestion, is excessive fluid accumulation in the tissue or air spaces (usually alveoli) of the lungs. This leads to impaired gas exchange, most often leading to shortness of breath (dyspnea) which can progress to hypoxemia and respiratory failure. Pulmonary edema has multiple causes and is traditionally classified as cardiogenic (caused by the heart) or noncardiogenic (all other types not caused by the heart).
Various laboratory tests (CBC, troponin, BNP, etc.) and imaging studies (chest x-ray, CT scan, ultrasound) are often used to diagnose and classify the cause of pulmonary edema. 
Treatment is focused on three aspects: 

improving respiratory function,
treating the underlying cause, and
preventing further damage and allow full recovery to the lung."
Toxic Shock Syndrome,"Persistent fever accompanied by rash, sore throat, widespread erythematous infiltrative lesions with desquamation, syncope, shock, headache, anemia, and maculopapular rash","Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a condition caused by bacterial toxins. Symptoms may include fever, rash, skin peeling, and low blood pressure. There may also be symptoms related to the specific underlying infection such as mastitis, osteomyelitis, necrotising fasciitis, or pneumonia.
TSS is typically caused by bacteria of the Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus type, though others may also be involved. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is sometimes referred to as toxic-shock-like syndrome (TSLS)."
Primary Macroglobulinemia Renal Damage,"Headache, dizziness, vertigo, diplopia, deafness, sensory abnormalities, transient hemiparesis, and ataxia","In hematology, plasma cell dyscrasias (also termed plasma cell disorders and plasma cell proliferative diseases) are a spectrum of progressively more severe monoclonal gammopathies in which a clone or multiple clones of pre-malignant or malignant plasma cells (sometimes in association with lymphoplasmacytoid cells or B lymphocytes) over-produce and secrete into the blood stream a myeloma protein, i.e. an abnormal monoclonal antibody or portion thereof. The exception to this rule is the disorder termed non-secretory multiple myeloma; this disorder is a form of plasma cell dyscrasia in which no myeloma protein is detected in serum or urine (at least as determined by conventional laboratory methods) of individuals who have clear evidence of an increase in clonal bone marrow plasma cells and/or evidence of clonal plasma cell-mediated tissue injury (e.g. plasmacytoma tumors). Here, a clone of plasma cells refers to group of plasma cells that are abnormal in that they have an identical genetic identity and therefore are descendants of a single genetically distinct ancestor cell."
Electrical Burn,"Wounds are grayish-yellow, charred yellow, dry, and painful","An electrical burn is a burn that results from electricity passing through the body causing rapid injury. Approximately 1000 deaths per year due to electrical injuries are reported in the United States, with a mortality rate of 3-5%. Electrical burns differ from thermal or chemical burns in that they cause much more subdermal damage. They can exclusively cause surface damage, but more often tissues deeper underneath the skin have been severely damaged. As a result, electrical burns are difficult to accurately diagnose, and many people underestimate the severity of their burn."
Colorectal Cancer,"Constipation, abdominal mass, anemia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, sticky stool, bloody stool with blood mixed with feces, skin metastasis, melena, extensive pelvic infiltration, and dissemination.","Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as bowel cancer, colon cancer, or rectal cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine). Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, abdominal pain and fatigue. Most colorectal cancers are due to lifestyle factors and genetic disorders. Risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red meat, processed meat, and alcohol."
Pediatric Leukemoid Reaction,"Fever, anemia, enlargement of liver, spleen, and lymph nodes","The term leukemoid reaction describes an increased
white blood cell count (> 50,000 cells/L), which is a physiological response to stress or infection (as opposed to a primary blood malignancy, such as leukemia). It often describes the presence of immature cells such as myeloblasts or red blood cells with nuclei in the peripheral blood.
It may be lymphoid or myeloid.


== Causes ==
As noted above, a leukemoid reaction is typically a response to an underlying medical issue. Causes of leukemoid reactions include:

Severe hemorrhage (retroperitoneal hemorrhage)
Drugs
Use of sulfa drugs
Use of dapsone
Use of glucocorticoids
Use of G-CSF or related growth factors
All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)
Ethylene glycol intoxication
Infections
Clostridioides difficile
Tuberculosis
Pertussis
Infectious mononucleosis (lymphocyte predominant)
Visceral larva migrans (eosinophil predominant)
Asplenia
Diabetic ketoacidosis
Organ necrosis
Hepatic necrosis
Ischemic colitis
As a feature of trisomy 21 in infancy (incidence of ~10%)
As a paraneoplastic phenomenon (rare)


== Diagnosis ==
Conventionally, a leukocytosis exceeding 50,000 WBC/mm3 with a significant increase in early neutrophil precursors is referred to as a leukemoid reaction."
Orbital Cavernous Hemangioma,"Vascular malformations, exophthalmos, eyelid swelling and presenting a pale green color","Cavernous hemangioma, also called cavernous angioma, venous malformation, or cavernoma, is a type of venous malformation due to endothelial dysmorphogenesis from a lesion which is present at birth. A cavernoma in the brain is called a cerebral cavernous malformation or CCM.  Despite its designation as a hemangioma, a cavernous hemangioma is a benign (but not harmless) condition, not a malignant tumor, as it does not display endothelial hyperplasia. The abnormal tissue causes a slowing of blood flow through the cavities, or ""caverns"". The blood vessels do not form the necessary junctions with surrounding cells, and the structural support from the smooth muscle is hindered, causing leakage into the surrounding tissue. It is the leakage of blood (hemorrhage) that causes a variety of symptoms known to be associated with the condition."
Allergic Cough,"Paroxysmal coughing, coughing up white foamy sputum, sneezing","Allergies, also known as allergic diseases, are various conditions caused by hypersensitivity of the immune system to typically harmless substances in the environment. These diseases include hay fever, food allergies, atopic dermatitis, allergic asthma, and anaphylaxis. Symptoms may include red eyes, an itchy rash, sneezing, coughing, a runny nose, shortness of breath, or swelling. Note that food intolerances and food poisoning are separate conditions.
Common allergens include pollen and certain foods."
Neurilemmoma,"Limb tumors are fusiform, and there is often numbness, pain, and hypersensitivity in the distal limbs that the nerves control.","A schwannoma (or neurilemmoma) is a usually benign nerve sheath tumor composed of Schwann cells, which normally produce the insulating myelin sheath covering peripheral nerves.
Schwannomas are homogeneous tumors, consisting only of Schwann cells. The tumor cells always stay on the outside of the nerve, but the tumor itself may either push the nerve aside and/or up against a bony structure (thereby possibly causing damage). Schwannomas are relatively slow-growing. For reasons not yet understood, schwannomas are mostly benign and less than 1% become malignant, degenerating into a form of cancer known as neurofibrosarcoma."
Esophageal Leukoplakia,"Dysphagia, retrosternal pain, mucosal leukoplakia","Oral leukoplakia is a potentially malignant disorder affecting the oral mucosa. It is defined as ""essentially an oral mucosal white/gray lesion that cannot be considered as any other definable lesion."" Oral leukoplakia is a gray patch or plaque that develops in the oral cavity and is strongly associated with smoking. Leukoplakia is a firmly attached white patch on a mucous membrane which is associated with increased risk of cancer. The edges of the lesion are typically abrupt and the lesion changes with time. Advanced forms may develop red patches."
Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis,"General malaise, fatigue, joint pain, cough, abdominal pain, sensory disturbances, wasting, deafness, weight loss","Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG or LG) is a very rare lymphoproliferative disorder first characterized in 1972. Lymphomatoid means lymphoma-like and  granulomatosis denotes the microscopic characteristic of the presence of granulomas with polymorphic lymphoid infiltrates and focal necrosis within it. 
LG most commonly affects middle aged people, but has occasionally been observed in young people. Males are found to be affected twice as often as females.


== Causes ==
Lymphomatoid granulomatosis involves malignant B cells and reactive, non-malignant T cells and is almost always associated with infection of the malignant B cells by the Epstein-Barr virus; it is therefore considered to be a form of the Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases."
Spinocerebellar Ataxia,"Ataxia, cerebellar ataxia, intention tremor, nystagmus, dementia, focal muscle tonus disorder, hyperreflexia, spastic paraplegic gait","Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a progressive, degenerative, genetic disease with multiple types, each of which could be considered a neurological condition in its own right. An estimated 150,000 people in the United States have a diagnosis of spinocerebellar ataxia at any given time. SCA is hereditary, progressive, degenerative, and often fatal. There is no known effective treatment or cure. SCA can affect anyone of any age."
Renal Fusion,"Ureteral obstruction, lower abdominal mass","Horseshoe kidney, also known as ren arcuatus  (in Latin), renal fusion or super kidney, is a congenital disorder affecting about 1 in 500 people that is more common in men, often asymptomatic, and usually diagnosed incidentally. In this disorder, the patient's kidneys fuse to form a horseshoe-shape during development in the womb. The fused part is the isthmus of the horseshoe kidney. The abnormal anatomy can affect kidney drainage resulting in increased frequency of kidney stones and urinary tract infections as well as increase risk of certain renal cancers.
Fusion abnormalities of the kidney can be categorized into two groups: horseshoe kidney and crossed fused ectopia."
Phyllodes Tumor of the Breast,"Painless lump in the breast, round, 1-3cm in size, mild swelling pain, mostly occurs on one side, slow growth","Phyllodes tumors (from Greek: phullon), are a rare type of biphasic fibroepithelial mass that form from the periductal stromal and epithelial cells of the breast. They account for less than 1% of all breast neoplasms. They were previously termed cystosarcoma phyllodes, coined by Johannes Mller in 1838, before being renamed to phyllodes tumor by the World Health Organization in 2003. Phullon, which means 'leaf' in Greek, describes the unique papillary projections characteristic of phyllodes tumors on histology. Diagnosis is made via a core-needle biopsy and treatment is typically surgical resection with wide margins (>1 cm), due to their propensity to recur."
Periosteal Chondroma,A round or ovoid mass of varying sizes on the outer surface of the cortical bone.,"Chondrosarcoma is a bone sarcoma, a primary cancer composed of cells derived from transformed cells that produce cartilage. A chondrosarcoma is a member of a category of tumors of bone and soft tissue known as sarcomas.  About 30% of bone sarcomas are chondrosarcomas. It is resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Unlike other primary bone sarcomas that mainly affect children and adolescents, a chondrosarcoma can present at any age."
Acute Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis,"Fever, dry cough, chest pain, hemoptysis, expectoration, coughing up brown sputum plugs, hemorrhagic necrosis, respiratory failure","Aspergillosis is a fungal infection of usually the lungs, caused by the genus Aspergillus, a common mold that is breathed in frequently from the air, but does not usually affect most people. It generally occurs in people with lung diseases such as asthma, cystic fibrosis or tuberculosis, or those who are immunocompromised such as those who have had a stem cell or organ transplant or those who take medications such as steroids and some cancer treatments which suppress the immune system. Rarely, it can affect skin.
Aspergillosis occurs in humans, birds and other animals. Aspergillosis occurs in chronic or acute forms which are clinically very distinct."
External Auditory Canal Ceruminous Adenoma,"Ear pain, itching, blockage, narrow external auditory canal, otorrhea, decreased hearing","A ceruminous adenoma  is a benign glandular neoplasm which arises from the ceruminous glands located within the external auditory canal. These glands are found within the outer one third to one half of the external auditory canal, more common along the posterior surface; therefore, the tumor develops within a very specific location.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Ceruminous adenoma are rare tumors, accounting for less than 1% of all external ear tumors. The patients will present with a mass, perhaps associated pain, and may have changes in hearing (usually a sensorineural or a conductive hearing loss). Some patients have tinnitus."
Intra-atrial conduction block,"Chest tightness, sinus arrest, dizziness, syncope","Heart block (HB) is a disorder in the heart's rhythm due to a fault in the natural pacemaker. This is caused by an obstruction  a block  in the electrical conduction system of the heart. Sometimes a disorder can be inherited. Despite the severe-sounding name, heart block may cause no symptoms at all in some cases, or occasional missed heartbeats in other cases (which can cause light-headedness, syncope (fainting), and palpitations), or may require the implantation of an  artificial pacemaker, depending upon exactly where in the heart conduction is being impaired and how significantly it is affected.
Heart block should not be confused with other conditions, which may or may not be co-occurring, relating to the heart and/or other nearby organs that are or can be serious, including angina (heart-related chest pain), heart attack (myocardial infarction), any type of heart failure, cardiogenic shock or other types of shock, different types of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), cardiac arrest, or respiratory arrest."
Cardiovascular Disease,"Rapid heartbeat, arrhythmias, tachycardia, bradycardia, dysrhythmia, difficulty breathing, cyanosis, fainting","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is any disease involving the heart or blood vessels. CVDs constitute a class of diseases that includes: coronary artery diseases (e.g. angina, heart attack), heart failure, hypertensive heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease, carditis, aortic aneurysms, peripheral artery disease, thromboembolic disease, and venous thrombosis.
The underlying mechanisms vary depending on the disease. It is estimated that dietary risk factors are associated with 53% of CVD deaths."
Chronic Pyelonephritis,"Chills, fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, back and lumbar pain, percussive tenderness in the renal area, frequency of urination, urgency, dysuria, and difficulty urinating","Pyelonephritis  is inflammation of the kidney, typically due to a bacterial infection. Symptoms most often include fever and flank tenderness. Other symptoms may include nausea, burning with urination, and frequent urination. Complications may include pus around the kidney, sepsis, or kidney failure.
It is typically due to a bacterial infection, most commonly Escherichia coli."
Chronic Granulomatous Disease in Children,"Eczematous changes around the ears and nose, purulent dermatitis, abscesses, local lymphadenopathy","Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), also known as BridgesGood syndrome, chronic granulomatous disorder, and Quie syndrome, is a diverse group of hereditary diseases in which certain cells of the immune system have difficulty forming the reactive oxygen compounds (most importantly the superoxide radical due to defective phagocyte NADPH oxidase) used to kill certain ingested pathogens. This leads to the formation of granulomas in many organs. CGD affects about 1 in 200,000 people in the United States, with about 20 new cases diagnosed each year.
This condition was first discovered in 1950 in a series of four boys from Minnesota, and in 1957 it was named ""a fatal granulomatosus of childhood"" in a publication describing their disease. The underlying cellular mechanism that causes chronic granulomatous disease was discovered in 1967, and research since that time has further elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease."
Brainstem Stroke,"Hemiplegia, aphasia, unilateral limb numbness, unsteady walk, urinary and fecal incontinence, mental disorientation, dementia","A brainstem stroke syndrome falls under the broader category of stroke syndromes, or specific symptoms caused by vascular injury to an area of brain (for example, the lacunar syndromes). As the brainstem contains numerous cranial nuclei and white matter tracts, a stroke in this area can have a number of unique symptoms depending on the particular blood vessel that was injured and the group of cranial nerves and tracts that are no longer perfused. Symptoms of a brainstem stroke frequently include sudden vertigo and ataxia, with or without weakness. Brainstem stroke can also cause diplopia, slurred speech and decreased level of consciousness. A more serious outcome is locked-in syndrome."
First-Degree Atrioventricular Block,Abnormal heart sounds,"First-degree atrioventricular block (AV block) is a disease of the electrical conduction system of the heart in which electrical impulses conduct from the cardiac atria to the ventricles through the atrioventricular node (AV node) more slowly than normal. First degree AV block does not generally cause any symptoms, but may progress to more severe forms of heart block such as second- and third-degree atrioventricular block. It is diagnosed using an electrocardiogram, and is defined as a PR interval greater than 200 milliseconds. First degree AV block affects 0.65-1.1% of the population with 0.13 new cases per 1000 persons each year.


== Causes ==
The most common causes of first-degree heart block are AV nodal disease, enhanced vagal tone (for example in athletes), myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction (especially acute inferior MI), electrolyte disturbances and medication."
Ciliary Body Melanoma,"Red eye, eye pain, visual impairment","Ciliary body melanoma is a type of cancer arising from the coloured part (uvea) of the eye.
About 12% of uveal melanoma arise from the ciliary body.


== Clinical features ==
It occurs most commonly in the sixth decade of life.

External signs include dilated episcleral blood vessels (sentinel vessels). Extraocular erosion may produce a dark mass beneath the conjunctiva."
Restrictive Cardiomyopathy,"Shortness of breath, hemoptysis, hepatomegaly, lower limb edema, electrophysiological abnormalities, palpitations, dizziness, syncope, prone to fainting, cardiac enlargement, heart failure, fatigue, and cold limbs","Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is a form of cardiomyopathy in which the walls of the heart are rigid (but not thickened). Thus the heart is restricted from stretching and filling with blood properly. It is the least common of the three original subtypes of cardiomyopathy: hypertrophic, dilated, and restrictive.
It should not be confused with constrictive pericarditis, a disease which presents similarly but is very different in treatment and prognosis.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Untreated hearts with RCM often develop the following characteristics:

M or W configuration in an invasive hemodynamic pressure tracing of the RA
Square root sign of part of the invasive hemodynamic pressure tracing Of The LV
Biatrial enlargement
Thickened LV walls (with normal chamber size)
Thickened RV free wall (with normal chamber size)
Elevated right atrial pressure (>12mmHg),
Moderate pulmonary hypertension,
Normal systolic function,
Poor diastolic function, typically Grade III - IV Diastolic heart failure."
Endometrioid Ovarian Neoplasm,"Pelvic mass, irregular vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, abdominal distension","Endometrioid tumors are a class of tumors that arise in the uterus or ovaries that resemble endometrial glands on histology. They account for 80% of endometrial carcinomas:724 and 20% of malignant ovarian tumors.:728


== Ovary ==

Ovarian endometrioid tumors are part of the surface epithelial tumor group of ovarian neoplasms (1020% of which are the endometrioid type).
Benign and borderline variants are rare, as the majority are malignant.
There is an association with endometriosis and concurrent primary endometrial carcinoma (endometrial cancer).
On gross pathological examination, the tumor is cystic and may be solid and some arise in cystic endometriosis."
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC),"Seizures and seizure-like episodes, angiofibromas, hypomelanotic macules (ash leaf spots), cognitive impairment, tubers, café-au-lait spots, infantile spasms, paralysis, ataxia, intracranial hypertension, hydrocephalus, and microphthalmia","Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare multisystem autosomal dominant genetic disease that causes non-cancerous tumours to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, liver, eyes, lungs and skin. A combination of symptoms may include seizures, intellectual disability, developmental delay, behavioral problems, skin abnormalities, lung disease, and kidney disease.
TSC is caused by a mutation of either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which code for the proteins hamartin and tuberin, respectively, with TSC2 mutations accounting for the majority and tending to cause more severe symptoms. These proteins act as tumor growth suppressors, agents that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation.
Prognosis is highly variable and depends on the symptoms, but life expectancy is normal for many."
Traumatic Glaucoma,"Loss of light reflex, detachment of the iris root, iris defect, heterochromia of the iris, lens opacity, elevated intraocular pressure, and tremor","Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can lead to damage of the optic nerve. The optic nerve transmits visual information from the eye to the brain. Glaucoma may cause vision loss if left untreated. It has been called the ""silent thief of sight"" because the loss of vision usually occurs slowly over a long period of time. A major risk factor for glaucoma is increased pressure within the eye, known as intraocular pressure (IOP)."
Adenoviral Enteritis,"Fever, diarrhea, watery stools, headache, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, accompanied by coughing and expectoration, nasal congestion and runny nose","Adenoviruses (members of the family Adenoviridae) are medium-sized (90100 nm), nonenveloped (without an outer lipid bilayer) viruses with an icosahedral nucleocapsid containing a double-stranded DNA genome. Their name derives from their initial isolation from human adenoids in 1953.
They have a broad range of vertebrate hosts; in humans, more than 50 distinct adenoviral serotypes have been found to cause a wide range of illnesses, from mild respiratory infections in young children (the common cold) to life-threatening multi-organ disease in people with a weakened immune system.

Cardiovascular Disease with Associated Mental Disorders,"Anxiety, depression, irritability, neurasthenia syndrome, hallucinations, consciousness disorders, shortness of breath, easy irritability, tension, fear, persecutory delusions, nausea","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is any disease involving the heart or blood vessels. CVDs constitute a class of diseases that includes: coronary artery diseases (e.g. angina, heart attack), heart failure, hypertensive heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, congenital heart disease, valvular heart disease, carditis, aortic aneurysms, peripheral artery disease, thromboembolic disease, and venous thrombosis.
The underlying mechanisms vary depending on the disease. It is estimated that dietary risk factors are associated with 53% of CVD deaths."
Louping-ill,"Meningitis, leukopenia, leukocytosis, low-grade fever","Louping-ill () is an acute viral disease primarily of sheep that is characterized by a biphasic fever, depression, ataxia, muscular incoordination, tremors, posterior paralysis, coma, and death. Louping-ill is a tick-transmitted disease whose occurrence is closely related to the distribution of the primary vector, the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus. It also causes disease in red grouse, and can affect humans. The name 'louping-ill' is derived from an old Scottish word describing the effect of the disease in sheep whereby they 'loup' or spring into the air.


== Cause ==

Louping ill is caused by RNA virus called Louping ill virus."
Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy in the Elderly,"Symmetrical pain and sensory abnormalities, more common in the lower limbs than the upper limbs, sensory abnormalities include numbness, ant crawling, insect crawling sensations, heating, electric shock-like sensations, often ascending from the distal toes up to above the knees, patients may experience a sensation similar to wearing socks or gloves","Diabetic foot ulcer is a breakdown of the skin and sometimes deeper tissues of the foot that leads to sore formation. It is thought to occur due to abnormal pressure or mechanical stress chronically applied to the foot, usually with concomitant predisposing conditions such as peripheral sensory neuropathy, peripheral motor neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy or peripheral arterial disease.  It is a major complication of diabetes mellitus, and it is a type of diabetic foot disease. Secondary complications to the ulcer, such as infection of the skin or subcutaneous tissue, bone infection, gangrene or sepsis are possible, often leading to amputation. 
A key feature of wound healing  is stepwise repair of lost extracellular matrix (ECM), the largest component of the dermal skin layer."
Penile Fibromatosis (Peyronie's Disease),"Multiple or single painless nodules, painful erections or deformity, sexual dysfunction or impotence, pain during erection and penile curvature when erect","The term fibromatosis refers to a group of soft tissue tumors which have certain characteristics in common, including absence of cytologic and clinical malignant features, a histology consistent with proliferation of well-differentiated fibroblasts, an infiltrative growth pattern, and aggressive clinical behavior with frequent local recurrence. It is classed by the World Health Organization as an intermediate soft tissue tumor related to the sarcoma family. Arthur Purdy Stout coined the term fibromatosis (in the name congenital generalized fibromatosis, describing myofibromatosis), in 1954.


== Diagnosis ==


=== Juvenile subtypes ===
Subtypes of juvenile fibromatosis include:

Infantile myofibromatosis: solitary tumors commonly occurring in the head and neck regions; multiple tumors occurring in the skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscles, and/or less commonly bones; or, rarely, tumors occurring in an internal organ(s).
Aponeurotic fibroma
Infantile digital fibromatosis
Aggressive infantile fibromatosis
Fibromatosis colli: benign sternocleidomastoid muscle tumor developing in infants within 8 weeks (average: 24 days) of delivery."
Acute Liver Failure,"Jaundice, low-grade fever, fatigue, anorexia, ascites, hypotension, cerebral edema, renal failure, portal hypertension, tendency to bleed, cholestasis, and purpura","Acute liver failure is the appearance of severe complications rapidly after the first signs (such as jaundice) of liver disease, and indicates that the liver has sustained severe damage (loss of function of 8090% of liver cells). The complications are hepatic encephalopathy and impaired protein synthesis (as measured by the levels of serum albumin and the prothrombin time in the blood). The 1993 classification defines hyperacute as within 1 week, acute as 828 days, and subacute as 412 weeks; both the speed with which the disease develops and the underlying cause strongly affect outcomes.


== Signs and symptoms ==
The main features of acute liver failure are rapid-onset jaundice, weakness, and eventually, changes in mental status that can begin as mild confusion but progress to coma, known as hepatic encephalopathy.


=== Encephalopathy and cerebral edema ===
In ALF, hepatic encephalopathy leads to cerebral edema, coma, brain herniation, and eventually death."
Specific Cardiomyopathy,"Shortness of breath after activity or labor, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, right heart arrhythmia, thromboembolism, sudden death","Cardiomyopathy is a group of primary diseases of the heart muscle. Early on there may be few or no symptoms. As the disease worsens, shortness of breath, feeling tired, and swelling of the legs may occur, due to the onset of heart failure. An irregular heart beat and fainting may occur. Those affected are at an increased risk of sudden cardiac death."
Hypovolemic Shock,"dizziness, pale complexion, cold sweats, restlessness or apathy, severe cases may experience fainting or even coma, rapid thin pulse, decrease in blood pressure and body temperature, rapid breathing, oliguria or anuria","Hypovolemic shock is a form of shock caused by severe hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume or extracellular fluid in the body). It can be caused by severe dehydration or blood loss. Hypovolemic shock is a medical emergency; if left untreated, the insufficient blood flow can cause damage to organs, leading to multiple organ failure.
In treating hypovolemic shock, it is important to determine the cause of the underlying hypovolemia, which may be the result of bleeding or other fluid losses. To minimize ischemic damage to tissues, treatment involves quickly replacing lost blood or fluids, with consideration of both rate and the type of fluids used."
Multi-infarct Dementia,"Central facial and lingual paralysis, hemiplegia, unilateral sensory disturbance, increased muscle tone, pyramidal signs, pseudobulbar palsy, hyperesthesia, urinary and fecal incontinence, reduced short-term memory and calculation abilities, apathetic facial expression, anxiety, mutism, depression or euphoria.","Vascular dementia is dementia caused by a series of strokes. Restricted blood flow due to strokes reduces oxygen and glucose delivery to the brain, causing cell injury and neurological deficits in the affected region. Subtypes of vascular dementia include subcortical vascular dementia, multi-infarct dementia, stroke-related dementia, and mixed dementia.
Subcortical vascular dementia occurs from damage to small blood vessels in the brain. Multi-infarct dementia results from a series of small strokes affecting several brain regions."
Esophageal Benign Tumors,"Dysphagia, cachexia and weight loss, retrosternal pain, hoarseness, odynophagia","A leiomyoma, also known as a fibroid, is a benign smooth muscle tumor that very rarely becomes cancer (0.1%). They can occur in any organ, but the most common forms occur in the uterus, small bowel, and the esophagus. Polycythemia may occur due to increased erythropoietin production as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome.
The word is from leio- + myo- + -oma, 'smooth-muscle tumor'. The plural form can be either the English leiomyomas or the classical leiomyomata."
Cervical Pregnancy,"Vaginal bleeding, bloody vaginal discharge, increased leukorrhea, purulent bloody leukorrhea, excessive vaginal bleeding, lower abdominal distension","A cervical pregnancy is an ectopic pregnancy that has implanted in the uterine endocervix. Such a pregnancy typically aborts within the first trimester, however, if it is implanted closer to the uterine cavity  a so-called cervico-isthmic pregnancy  it may continue longer. Placental removal in a cervical pregnancy may result in major hemorrhage.


== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis is made in asymptomatic pregnant women either by inspection seeing a bluish discolored cervix or, more commonly, by obstetric ultrasonography. A typical non-specific symptom is vaginal bleeding during pregnancy."
Electrocution,"Cardiac arrest, shock, hypotension","Electrocution is death or severe injury  caused by electric shock from electric current passing through the body. The word is derived from ""electro"" and ""execution"", but it is also used for accidental death.
The term ""electrocution"" was coined in 1889 in the US just before the first use of the electric chair and originally referred to only electrical execution and not other electrical deaths. However, since no English word was available for non-judicial deaths due to electric shock, the word ""electrocution"" eventually took over as a description of all circumstances of electrical death from the new commercial electricity.


== Origins ==

In the Netherlands, in 1746, Pieter van Musschenbroek's lab assistant, Andreas Cuneus, received an extreme shock while working with a leyden jar, the first recorded injury from human-made electricity."
Neurogenic Shock,"Dizziness, pallor, sweating","Neurogenic shock is a distributive type of shock resulting in hypotension (low blood pressure), often with bradycardia (slowed heart rate), caused by disruption of autonomic nervous system pathways. It can occur after damage to the central nervous system, such as spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury. Low blood pressure occurs due to decreased systemic vascular resistance resulting from loss of sympathetic tone, which in turn causes blood pooling within the extremities rather than being available to circulate throughout the body. The slowed heart rate results from a vagal response unopposed by a sympathetic nervous system (SNS) response.  Such cardiovascular instability is exacerbated by hypoxia, or treatment with endotracheal or endobronchial suction used to prevent pulmonary aspiration."
Cervical Polyp,"Yellow or blood-stained odorous vaginal discharge, postmenopausal bleeding","A cervical polyp is a common benign polyp or tumour on the surface of the cervical canal. They can cause irregular menstrual bleeding but often show no symptoms. Treatment consists of simple removal of the polyp and prognosis is generally good. About 1% of cervical polyps will show neoplastic change which may lead to cancer. They are most common in post-menarche, pre-menopausal women who have been pregnant."
Tuberculoma of the Brain,"Night sweats, fatigue, ataxia, focal symptoms, seizures, coughing, lymphadenopathy, and increased intracranial pressure","A tuberculoma is a clinical manifestation of tuberculosis which conglomerates tubercles into a firm lump, and so can mimic cancer tumors of many types in medical imaging studies. They often arise within individuals in whom a primary tuberculosis infection is not well controlled. When tuberculomas arise intracranially, they represent a manifestation of CNS tuberculosis. Since these are evolutions of primary complex, the tuberculomas may contain caseum or calcifications.
With the passage of time, Mycobacterium tuberculosis can transform into crystals of calcium."
Gastrointestinal Bleeding,"Hematemesis, melena, upper abdominal pain, tarry stools","Gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed), also called gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIB), is all forms of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the rectum. When there is significant blood loss over a short time, symptoms may include vomiting red blood, vomiting black blood, bloody stool, or black stool. Small amounts of bleeding over a long time may cause iron-deficiency anemia resulting in feeling tired or heart-related chest pain. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, shortness of breath, pale skin, or passing out. Sometimes in those with small amounts of bleeding no symptoms may be present."
Colonic Polyps,"Abdominal pain, tenesmus, hematochezia, mucus in stool, constipation, colonic polyps, and intussusception","A colorectal polyp is a polyp (fleshy growth) occurring on the lining of the colon or rectum. Untreated colorectal polyps can develop into colorectal cancer.
Colorectal polyps are often classified by their behaviour (i.e. benign vs. malignant) or cause (e.g."
Tonsillar Cancer,"Pharyngeal discomfort, pain, bad breath, bleeding, difficulty opening mouth, dysphagia, and respiratory distress","Oropharyngeal cancer, also known as oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and tonsil cancer, is a disease in which abnormal cells with the potential to both grow locally and spread to other parts of the body are found in the oral cavity, in the tissue of the part of the throat (oropharynx) that includes the base of the tongue, the tonsils, the soft palate, and the walls of the pharynx.
The two types of oropharyngeal cancers are HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, which is caused by an oral human papillomavirus infection; and HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer, which is linked to use of alcohol, tobacco, or both.
Oropharyngeal cancer is diagnosed by biopsy of observed abnormal tissue in the throat. Oropharyngeal cancer  is staged according to the appearance of the abnormal cells on the biopsy coupled with the dimensions and the extent of the abnormal cells found. Treatment is with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy; or some combination of those treatments."
Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome (SMAS),"Emaciation, dehydration, acute gastric dilatation, vomiting, abdominal distention, abdominal discomfort, lethargy, anorexia, malnutrition","Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome is a gastro-vascular disorder in which the third and final portion of the duodenum is compressed between the abdominal aorta (AA) and the overlying superior mesenteric artery.  This rare, potentially life-threatening syndrome is typically caused by an angle of 625 between the AA and the SMA, in comparison to the normal range of 3856, due to a lack of retroperitoneal and visceral fat (mesenteric fat). In addition, the aortomesenteric distance is 28 millimeters, as opposed to the typical 1020. However, a narrow SMA angle alone is not enough to make a diagnosis, because patients with a low BMI, most notably children, have been known to have a narrow SMA angle with no symptoms of SMA syndrome.
SMA syndrome is also known as Wilkie's syndrome, cast syndrome, mesenteric root syndrome, chronic duodenal ileus and intermittent arterio-mesenteric occlusion."
Osteosarcoma in Children,"Disuse muscle atrophy, anemia, necrosis, limb pain, joint swelling, local tenderness, bone mass","An osteosarcoma (OS) or osteogenic sarcoma (OGS) is a cancerous tumor in a bone. Specifically, it is an aggressive malignant neoplasm that arises from primitive transformed cells of mesenchymal origin (and thus a sarcoma) and that exhibits osteoblastic differentiation and produces malignant osteoid.
Osteosarcoma is the most common histological form of primary bone sarcoma. It is most prevalent in teenagers and young adults.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Many patients first complain of pain that may be worse at night, may be intermittent and of varying intensity and may have been occurring for a long time."
Lacunar Stroke,"Headache, dizziness, fatigue","Lacunar stroke or lacunar cerebral infarct (LACI) is the most common type of ischemic stroke, resulting from the occlusion of small penetrating arteries that provide blood to the brain's deep structures. Patients who present with symptoms of a lacunar stroke, but who have not yet had diagnostic imaging performed, may be described as having lacunar stroke syndrome (LACS).
Much of the current knowledge of lacunar strokes comes from C. Miller Fisher's cadaver dissections of post-mortem stroke patients. He observed ""lacunae"" (empty spaces) in the deep brain structures after occlusion of 200800 m penetrating arteries and connected them with five classic syndromes. These syndromes are still noted today, though lacunar infarcts are diagnosed based on clinical judgment and radiologic imaging."
Inverted Nipple,"The nipple is retracted into the areola, making it difficult for infants to latch on.","An inverted nipple (occasionally invaginated nipple) is a condition where the nipple, instead of pointing outward, is retracted into the breast. In some cases, the nipple will be temporarily protruded if stimulated. Both women and men can have inverted nipples.


== Causes ==
The most common causes of nipple inversion include:

Born with condition
Trauma which can be caused by conditions such as fat necrosis, scars, or a result of surgery
Breast sagging, drooping or ptosis
Breast cancer
Breast carcinoma
Paget's disease
Inflammatory breast cancer
Breast infections or inflammations
Mammary duct ectasia
Breast abscess
Mastitis
Genetic variant of nipple shape, such as:
Weaver syndrome
Congenital disorder of glycosylation type 1A and 1 L
Kennerknecht-Sorgo-Oberhoffer syndrome
Gynecomastia
Recurrent infections
Tuberculosis
Most common nipple variations that women are born with are caused by short ducts or a wide areola muscle sphincter.
Inverted nipples can also occur after sudden and major weight loss."
Pulmonary Mucormycosis,"Facial pain, headache, drowsiness, chest pain, difficulty breathing, hemoptysis, ulceration, facial pain, drowsiness, black eschar in the palate, ptosis, coma","Mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, is a severe fungal infection that comes under fulminant fungal sinusitis, usually in people who are immunocompromised. It is curable only when diagnosed early. Symptoms depend on where in the body the infection occurs. It most commonly infects the nose, sinuses, eyes and brain resulting in a runny nose, one-sided facial swelling and pain, headache, fever, blurred vision, bulging or displacement of the eye (proptosis), and tissue death. Other forms of disease may infect the lungs, stomach and intestines, and skin."
Open Head Injury,"Scalp laceration, bleeding, coma","A head injury is any injury that results in trauma to the skull or brain. The terms traumatic brain injury and head injury are often used interchangeably in the medical literature. Because head injuries cover such a broad scope of injuries, there are many causesincluding accidents, falls, physical assault, or traffic accidentsthat can cause head injuries.
The number of new cases is 1.7 million in the United States each year, with about 3% of these incidents leading to death. Adults have head injuries more frequently than any age group resulting from falls, motor vehicle crashes, colliding or being struck by an object, or assaults."
Colorectal Cancer,"Constipation, abdominal mass, anemia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, sticky stool, bloody stool with blood mixed with feces, skin metastasis, melena, extensive pelvic infiltration, and dissemination.","Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as bowel cancer, colon cancer, or rectal cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine). Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, abdominal pain and fatigue. Most colorectal cancers are due to lifestyle factors and genetic disorders. Risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red meat, processed meat, and alcohol."
Lead Poisoning,"Severe poisoning, inability to dorsiflex feet and toes, pigmentation of oral mucosa, palpitations, epilepsy, and epileptic seizures","Lead poisoning, also known as plumbism and saturnism, is a type of metal poisoning caused by lead in the body. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, irritability, memory problems, infertility, numbness and tingling in the hands and feet. It causes almost 10% of intellectual disability of otherwise unknown cause and can result in behavioral problems. Some of the effects are permanent. In severe cases, anemia, seizures, coma, or death may occur."
Thrombosis Formation,"Atherosclerosis, dyspnea, varicose veins, coughing, hemoptysis, pallor, skin erythema, hemiplegia","Coronary thrombosis is defined as the formation of a blood clot inside a blood vessel of the heart. This blood clot may then restrict blood flow within the heart, leading to heart tissue damage, or a myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack.
Coronary thrombosis is most commonly caused as a downstream effect of atherosclerosis, a buildup of cholesterol and fats in the artery walls. The smaller vessel diameter allows less blood to flow and facilitates progression to a myocardial infarction. Leading risk factors for coronary thrombosis are high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and hypertension."
Hyperglycemia,"Polyphagia, polydipsia, polyuria, weight loss, blurred vision","Hypoglycemia (American English), also spelled hypoglycaemia or hypoglycmia (British English), sometimes called low blood sugar, is a fall in blood sugar to levels below normal, typically below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). Whipple's triad is used to properly identify hypoglycemic episodes. It is defined as blood glucose below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), symptoms associated with hypoglycemia, and resolution of symptoms when blood sugar returns to normal. Hypoglycemia may result in headache, tiredness, clumsiness, trouble talking, confusion, fast heart rate, sweating, shakiness, nervousness, hunger, loss of consciousness, seizures, or death. Symptoms typically come on quickly."
Chronic Monocytic Leukemia,"Fatigue, palpitations, pallor, low-grade fever, infections, bleeding","Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), also known as chronic myeloid leukemia, is a cancer of the white blood cells. It is a form of leukemia characterized by the increased and unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of these cells in the blood. CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) and their precursors is found; characteristic increase in basophils is clinically relevant. It is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome.
CML is largely treated with targeted drugs called tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which have led to dramatically improved long-term survival rates since 2001."
Postpartum Hemorrhage,"Excessive vaginal bleeding, soft birth canal laceration, vaginal hemorrhage, pale complexion, nausea and vomiting, chills, retained lochia, hypovolemic shock, postpartum abdominal pain, post-hemorrhagic anemia, uterine bleeding, palpitations","Postpartum bleeding or postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is often defined as the loss of more than 500 ml or 1,000 ml of blood  following childbirth. Some have added the requirement that there also be signs or symptoms of low blood volume for the condition to exist. Signs and symptoms may initially include: an increased heart rate, feeling faint upon standing, and an increased breathing rate. As more blood is lost, the patient may feel cold, blood pressure may drop, and they may become restless or unconscious. In severe cases circulatory collapse, disseminated intravascular coagulation and death can occur."
Monocytic Leukemia,"Nodules, papules, gingival swelling and pain, vesicular or bullous lesions","Acute monocytic leukemia (AMoL, or AML-M5) is a type of acute myeloid leukemia. In AML-M5 >80% of the leukemic cells are of monocytic lineage. This cancer is characterized by a dominance of monocytes in the bone marrow. There is an overproduction of monocytes that the body does not need in the periphery. These overproduced monocytes interfere with normal immune cell production which causes many health complications for the affected individual."
Mesenteric Ischemia,"Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting, upper abdominal tenderness","Intestinal ischemia is a medical condition in which injury to the large or small intestine occurs due to not enough blood supply. It can come on suddenly, known as acute intestinal ischemia, or gradually, known as chronic intestinal ischemia. The acute form of the disease often presents with sudden severe abdominal pain and is associated with a high risk of death. The chronic form typically presents more gradually with abdominal pain after eating, unintentional weight loss, vomiting, and fear of eating.
Risk factors for acute intestinal ischemia include atrial fibrillation, heart failure, chronic kidney failure, being prone to forming blood clots, and previous myocardial infarction."
Sebaceous Adenoma,"Painless mass on the skin surface, redness, pain, and purulent discharge from the mass upon infection, accompanied by the discharge of cottage cheese-like fluid","Sebaceous adenomais a type of adenoma, characterized by a slow-growing tumor usually presenting as a pink, flesh-coloured, or yellow papule or nodule.:662


== Significance ==
Sebaceous adenomas, in isolation, are not significant; however, they may be associated with Muir-Torre syndrome, a genetic condition that predisposes individuals to cancer.  It is also linked to hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome).
It is not the same as ""adenoma sebaceum"" by F. Balzer and P.E. Mntrier (1885). The term ""adenoma sebaceum"" is a misnomer for facial angiofibromas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex.

Peritoneal Metastasis Cancer,"Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, weight loss, abdominal distension, ascites, loss of appetite, fatigue, anemia","Metastasis is a pathogenic agent's spreading from an initial or primary site to a different or secondary site within the host's body; the term is typically used when referring to metastasis by a cancerous tumor.  The newly pathological sites, then, are metastases (mets). It is generally distinguished from cancer invasion, which is the direct extension and penetration by cancer cells into neighboring tissues.
Cancer occurs after cells are genetically altered to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. This uncontrolled proliferation by mitosis produces a primary heterogeneic tumour."
Traumatic Brain Injury,"Mood swings, lack of concentration, dizziness, fatigue, headache, insomnia, memory disorders","A traumatic brain injury (TBI), also known as an intracranial injury, is an injury to the brain caused by an external force. TBI can be classified based on severity ranging from mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI/concussion) to severe traumatic brain injury. TBI can also be characterized based on mechanism (closed or penetrating head injury) or other features (e.g., occurring in a specific location or over a widespread area). Head injury is a broader category that may involve damage to other structures such as the scalp and skull. TBI can result in physical, cognitive, social, emotional and behavioral symptoms, and outcomes can range from complete recovery to permanent disability or death."
Fibromatosis,"Localized lumps, pain","The term fibromatosis refers to a group of soft tissue tumors which have certain characteristics in common, including absence of cytologic and clinical malignant features, a histology consistent with proliferation of well-differentiated fibroblasts, an infiltrative growth pattern, and aggressive clinical behavior with frequent local recurrence. It is classed by the World Health Organization as an intermediate soft tissue tumor related to the sarcoma family. Arthur Purdy Stout coined the term fibromatosis (in the name congenital generalized fibromatosis, describing myofibromatosis), in 1954.


== Diagnosis ==


=== Juvenile subtypes ===
Subtypes of juvenile fibromatosis include:

Infantile myofibromatosis: solitary tumors commonly occurring in the head and neck regions; multiple tumors occurring in the skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscles, and/or less commonly bones; or, rarely, tumors occurring in an internal organ(s).
Aponeurotic fibroma
Infantile digital fibromatosis
Aggressive infantile fibromatosis
Fibromatosis colli: benign sternocleidomastoid muscle tumor developing in infants within 8 weeks (average: 24 days) of delivery."
Jugular Paraganglioma,"Dizziness, vertigo, recurrent bleeding in the external auditory canal, tinnitus, progressive hearing loss","A paraganglioma is a rare neuroendocrine neoplasm that may develop at various body sites (including the head, neck, thorax and abdomen). When the same type of tumor is found in the adrenal gland, they are referred to as a pheochromocytoma. They are rare tumors, with an overall estimated incidence of 1 in 300,000. There is no test that determines benign from malignant tumors; long-term follow-up is therefore recommended for all individuals with paraganglioma.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Most paragangliomas are asymptomatic, present as a painless mass, or create symptoms such as hypertension, tachycardia, headache, and palpitations."
Cervical Carbuncle,"Fatigue, high fever, chills, local lymph node enlargement, severe pain, ulceration, edema","This list of unusual deaths includes unique or extremely rare circumstances of death recorded throughout the 20th century, noted as being unusual by multiple sources."
Post-traumatic Pneumocephalus,"Severe headache, otorrhea, abnormal sweating, vomiting, increased intracranial pressure","Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), originally called BOLD venographic imaging, is an MRI sequence that is exquisitely sensitive to venous blood, hemorrhage and iron storage. SWI uses a fully flow compensated, long echo, gradient recalled echo (GRE) pulse sequence to acquire images. This method exploits the susceptibility differences between tissues and uses the phase image to detect these differences. The magnitude and phase data are combined to produce an enhanced contrast magnitude image. The imaging of venous blood with SWI is a blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) technique which is why it was (and is sometimes still) referred to as BOLD venography."
Pseudomyxoma Peritonei,"Abdominal distension, nausea and vomiting, emaciation, abdominal pain, difficulty in breathing, chest tightness, difficulty turning over, reduced appetite, fatigue, hepatomegaly","Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a clinical condition caused by cancerous cells (mucinous adenocarcinoma) that produce abundant mucin or gelatinous ascites. The tumors cause fibrosis of tissues and impede digestion or organ function, and if left untreated, the tumors and mucin they produce will fill the abdominal cavity.  This will result in compression of organs and will destroy the function of the colon, small intestine, stomach, or other organs.
Prognosis with treatment in many cases is optimistic, but the disease is lethal if untreated, with death occurring via cachexia, bowel obstruction, or other types of complications.
This disease is most commonly caused by an appendiceal primary cancer (cancer of the appendix); mucinous tumors of the ovary have also been implicated, although in most cases ovarian involvement is favored to be a metastasis from an appendiceal or other gastrointestinal source."
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease,"Memory decline, headache, dizziness, and ataxia","CreutzfeldtJakob disease (CJD) is an incurable, always fatal neurodegenerative disease belonging to the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) group. Early symptoms include memory problems, behavioral changes, poor coordination, and visual and/or auditory disturbances. Later symptoms include dementia, involuntary movements, blindness and/or deafness, weakness, and coma. About 70% of people die within a year of diagnosis. The name ""CreutzfeldtJakob disease"" was introduced by Walther Spielmeyer in 1922, after the German neurologists Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt and Alfons Maria Jakob."
Primary Bone Lymphoma,"Bone pain, fatigue, fever, muscle soreness","Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), also known as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, is a group of blood cancers that includes all types of lymphomas except Hodgkin lymphomas. Symptoms include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and tiredness. Other symptoms may include bone pain, chest pain, or itchiness. Some forms are slow-growing while others are fast-growing. Unlike Hodgkin lymphoma, which spreads contiguously, NHL is largely a systemic illness."
Congenital Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis,"Long-segment developmental deficiency of the ascending aorta, palpitations, pleural effusion, congenital heart conduction abnormalities, chest pain, headache, systolic thrill, cough, rupture of the aortic sinus, circumferential constriction at the root of the ascending aorta, abnormal breathing, sudden death","Aortic stenosis (AS or AoS) is the narrowing  of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart (where the aorta begins), such that problems result. It may occur at the aortic valve as well as above and below this level. It typically gets worse over time. Symptoms often come on gradually with a decreased ability to exercise often occurring first. If heart failure, loss of consciousness, or heart related chest pain occur due to AS the outcomes are worse."
Mitral Valve Prolapse Syndrome,"Chest tightness, chest pain, difficulty breathing, hemoptysis, cyanosis","Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a valvular heart disease characterized by the displacement of an abnormally thickened mitral valve leaflet into the left atrium during systole. It is the primary form of myxomatous degeneration of the valve. There are various types of MVP, broadly classified as classic and nonclassic. In severe cases of classic MVP, complications include mitral regurgitation, infective endocarditis, congestive heart failure, and, in rare circumstances, cardiac arrest.
The diagnosis of MVP primarily relies on echocardiography, which uses ultrasound to visualize the mitral valve."
Ocular Ischemic Syndrome,"Eye itching, blurred vision, visual impairment","Ocular ischemic syndrome is the constellation of ocular signs and symptoms secondary to severe, chronic arterial hypoperfusion to the eye. Amaurosis fugax is a form of acute vision loss caused by reduced blood flow to the eye; it may be a warning sign of an impending stroke, as both stroke and retinal artery occlusion can be caused by thromboembolism due to atherosclerosis elsewhere in the body (such as coronary artery disease and especially carotid atherosclerosis). Retinal artery occlusion is also caused by a left atrial thrombus in patients with atrial fibrillation. Consequently, those with transient blurring of vision are advised to urgently seek medical attention for a thorough evaluation of the carotid artery. Anterior segment ischemic syndrome is a similar ischemic condition of anterior segment usually seen in post-surgical cases."
Gastric leiomyosarcoma,"Hematemesis and melena, abdominal pain, discomfort in the upper abdomen, palpable mass in the upper abdomen, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, acute abdomen, peritoneal irritation sign, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, fever, cachexia","Carney triad (CT) is  characterized by the coexistence of three types of neoplasms, mainly in young women, including gastric gastrointestinal stromal tumor, pulmonary chondroma, and extra-adrenal paraganglioma.  The underlying genetic defect remains elusive. CT is distinct from Carney complex and CarneyStratakis syndrome.


== Background ==
Carney triad (CT), named for J. Aidan Carney, is considered to be a specific type of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN). The three classically associated tumors are a subset of gastric epithelioid leiomyosarcoma (it is now known that this subset is actually gastrointestinal stromal tumor arising from the interstitial cells of Cajal), pulmonary chondroma, and extra-adrenal paraganglioma."
Hypercalcemia,"Fatigue, nausea and vomiting, headache, polyuria, seizures, constipation, tiredness, absent tendon reflexes, loss of appetite, arrhythmias","Hypercalcemia, also spelled hypercalcaemia, is a high calcium (Ca2+) level in the blood serum. The normal range for total calcium is 2.12.6 mmol/L (8.810.7 mg/dL, 4.35.2 mEq/L), with levels greater than 2.6 mmol/L defined as hypercalcemia. Those with a mild increase that has developed slowly typically have no symptoms. In those with greater levels or rapid onset, symptoms may include abdominal pain, bone pain, confusion, depression, weakness, kidney stones or an abnormal heart rhythm including cardiac arrest.
Most outpatient cases are due to primary hyperparathyroidism and inpatient cases due to cancer."
Radiation Thyroiditis,"Difficulty swallowing, fatigue, palpitations, skin itching, thyroid enlargement, tremors, edema","Radiation-induced thyroiditis is a form of painful, acute thyroiditis resulting from radioactive therapy to treat hyperthyroidism or from radiation to treat head and neck cancer or lymphoma. It affects 1% of those who have received radioactive iodine (I-131) therapy for Graves' Disease, typically presenting between 5 and 10 days after the procedure. Stored T3 and T4 are released as rapid destruction of thyroid tissue occurs which results in pain, tenderness, and exacerbation of hyperthyroidism."
Fallopian Tube Tuberculosis,"Low fever, night sweats, lower abdominal tenderness, menstrual irregularities","Ectopic pregnancy is a complication of pregnancy in which the embryo attaches outside the uterus. Signs and symptoms classically include abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding, but fewer than 50 percent of affected women have both of these symptoms. The pain may be described as sharp, dull, or crampy. Pain may also spread to the shoulder if bleeding into the abdomen has occurred. Severe bleeding may result in a fast heart rate, fainting, or shock."
Cancer Pain,"Pain, nausea, vomiting, cachexia","Pain in cancer may arise from a tumor compressing or infiltrating nearby body parts; from treatments and diagnostic procedures; or from skin, nerve and other changes caused by a hormone imbalance or immune response. Most chronic (long-lasting) pain is caused by the illness and most acute (short-term) pain is caused by treatment or diagnostic procedures. However, radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy may produce painful conditions that persist long after treatment has ended.
The presence of pain depends mainly on the location of the cancer and the stage of the disease. At any given time, about half of all people diagnosed with malignant cancer are experiencing pain, and two-thirds of those with advanced cancer experience pain of such intensity that it adversely affects their sleep, mood, social relations and activities of daily living."
Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation,"Palpitations, chest tightness, heart pounding","Atrial fibrillation (AF, AFib or A-fib) is an abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) characterized by rapid and irregular beating of the atrial chambers of the heart. It often begins as short periods of abnormal beating, which become longer or continuous over time.  It may also start as other forms of arrhythmia such as atrial flutter that then transform into AF.
Episodes can be asymptomatic. Symptomatic episodes may involve heart palpitations, fainting, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, or shortness of breath. Atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, dementia, and stroke."
Histoplasmosis,"Fever, night sweats, weight loss","Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. Symptoms of this infection vary greatly, but the disease affects primarily the lungs. Occasionally, other organs are affected; called disseminated histoplasmosis, it can be fatal if left untreated.
H. capsulatum is found in soil, often associated with decaying bat guano or bird droppings. Disruption of soil from excavation or construction releases infectious spores that can be inhaled by humans."
Childhood Congenital Leukocyte Anomaly Syndrome,"Blue iris, nystagmus, lymphadenopathy, absence of light reflex, anemia, visual impairment, coma, thrombocytopenia, photophobia, pupillary abnormalities, ptosis, pigmentary disorders","A congenital disorder of glycosylation (previously called carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome) is one of several rare inborn errors of metabolism in which glycosylation of a variety of tissue proteins and/or lipids is deficient or defective. Congenital disorders of glycosylation are sometimes known as CDG syndromes. They often cause serious, sometimes fatal, malfunction of several different organ systems (especially the nervous system, muscles, and intestines) in affected infants. The most common sub-type is PMM2-CDG (formerly known as CDG-Ia) where the genetic defect leads to the loss of phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of mannose-6-phosphate into mannose-1-phosphate.


== Presentation ==
Clinical features depend on the molecular pathology of the particular CDG subtype."
Acute Undifferentiated Myeloid Leukemia,"Anemia, bleeding, bone pain, infection","Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), also known as chronic myeloid leukemia, is a cancer of the white blood cells. It is a form of leukemia characterized by the increased and unregulated growth of myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the accumulation of these cells in the blood. CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell disorder in which a proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils) and their precursors is found; characteristic increase in basophils is clinically relevant. It is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a characteristic chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome.
CML is largely treated with targeted drugs called tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which have led to dramatically improved long-term survival rates since 2001."
Strongyloidiasis,"Abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, anorexia, constipation","Strongyloidiasis is a human parasitic disease caused by the nematode called Strongyloides stercoralis, or sometimes the closely related S. flleborni. These helminths belong to a group of nematodes called roundworms. These intestinal worms can cause a number of symptoms in people, principally skin symptoms, abdominal pain, diarrhea and weight loss, but also many other specific and vague symptoms in disseminated disease, and severe life-threatening conditions through hyperinfection. In some people, particularly those who require corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication, Strongyloides can cause a hyperinfection syndrome that can lead to death if untreated. The diagnosis is made by blood and stool tests."
Food Induced Diarrhea,"Diarrhea, abdominal pain, borborygmus, foul-smelling stools, bloating, sour belching, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting","Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) is a systemic, non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy to a specific trigger within food, most likely food protein. As opposed to the more common IgE food allergy, which presents within seconds with rash, hives, difficulty breathing or anaphylaxis, FPIES presents with a delayed reaction where vomiting is the primary symptom. In its acute form, FPIES presents with vomiting that typically begins 1 to 4 hours after the trigger of food ingestion, alongside paleness of the skin, lethargy, and potentially blood-tinged diarrhea. In the severe form of acute FPIES, continued vomiting may cause severe dehydration or hypotensive shock-like state, requiring hospitalization. In its chronic form, continued exposure to trigger foods results in chronic or episodic vomiting, poor weight gain, failure to thrive, and watery or blood-tinged diarrhea."
Linitis Plastica,"Abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, indigestion","Linitis plastica (sometimes referred to as leather bottle stomach) is a morphological variant of diffuse stomach cancer in which the stomach wall becomes thick and rigid.
Linitis plastica is a type of adenocarcinoma and accounts for 319% of gastric adenocarcinomas. Causes of cancerous linitis plastica are commonly primary gastric cancer, but in rarer cases could be metastatic infiltration of the stomach, particularly breast and lung carcinoma. It is not associated with H. pylori infection or chronic gastritis. The risk factors are undefined, except for rare inherited mutations in E-cadherin."
Glomus Tumor,"Blue rubber bleb nevus, severe localized pain","Glomus tumor was also the name formerly (and incorrectly) used for a tumor now called a paraganglioma.

A glomus tumor (also known as a ""solitary glomus tumor"") is a rare neoplasm arising from the glomus body and mainly found under the nail, on the fingertip or in the foot.:670  They account for less than 2% of all soft tissue tumors. The majority of glomus tumors are benign, but they can also show malignant features. Glomus tumors were first described by Hoyer in 1877 while the first complete clinical description was given by Masson in 1924.
Histologically, glomus tumors are made up of an afferent arteriole, anastomotic vessel, and collecting venule."
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD),"Amenorrhea, hand-wringing, nausea, tinnitus, diarrhea, difficulty exhaling, anxiety, tension headaches","Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is an anxiety disorder characterized by excessive, uncontrollable and often irrational worry about events or activities. Worry often interferes with daily functioning. Individuals with GAD are often overly concerned about everyday matters such as health, finances, death, family, relationship concerns, or work difficulties. Symptoms may include excessive worry, restlessness, trouble sleeping, exhaustion, irritability, sweating, and trembling.
Symptoms must be consistent and ongoing, persisting at least six months for a formal diagnosis."
Type IV Renal Tubular Acidosis,"Fatigue, lethargy, somnolence, muscle weakness, arrhythmia","Hyperkalemia is an elevated level of potassium (K+) in the blood. Normal potassium levels are between 3.5 and 5.0 mmol/L (3.5 and 5.0 mEq/L) with levels above 5.5 mmol/L defined as hyperkalemia. Typically hyperkalemia does not cause symptoms. Occasionally when severe it can cause palpitations, muscle pain, muscle weakness, or numbness. Hyperkalemia can cause an abnormal heart rhythm which can result in cardiac arrest and death."
Gastrointestinal Cancer,"Weight loss, decreased appetite, hematochezia","Gastrointestinal cancer refers to malignant conditions of the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and accessory organs of digestion, including the esophagus, stomach, biliary system, pancreas, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and anus. The symptoms relate to the organ affected and can include obstruction (leading to difficulty swallowing or defecating), abnormal bleeding or other associated problems. The diagnosis often requires endoscopy, followed by biopsy of suspicious tissue. The treatment depends on the location of the tumor, as well as the type of cancer cell and whether it has invaded other tissues or spread elsewhere. These factors also determine the prognosis."
Acute Myocardial Infarction,"Angina, upper abdominal pain, chest tightness, numbness of upper limbs, dizzy spells, restlessness, nausea and vomiting, abnormal sweating, tachycardia, fear, fever","A myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops in one of the coronary arteries of the heart, causing infarction (tissue death) to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is retrosternal chest pain or discomfort that classically radiates to the left shoulder, arm, or jaw. The pain may occasionally feel like heartburn. This is the dangerous type of acute coronary syndrome.
Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, feeling tired, and decreased level of consciousness."
Iridocyclitis Syndrome of Glaucoma,"Increased intraocular pressure, sudden and rapid increase in eye pressure, pupil deformation, eye fatigue, elevated intraocular pressure, visual impairment, blurred vision","PosnerSchlossman syndrome (PSS) also known as glaucomatocyclitic crisis (GCC) is a rare acute ocular condition with unilateral attacks of mild granulomatous anterior uveitis and elevated intraocular pressure. It is sometimes considered as a secondary inflammatory glaucoma.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Ocular hypertension (IOP 30 - 70 mmHg) with open angle of anterior chamber and unilateral mild granulomatous anterior uveitis are hallmark signs of PosnerSchlossman syndrome. On slit-lamp examination, conjunctival injections, epithelial corneal edema, small to medium-sized fine keratitic precipitates, aqueous cells and flare may also be noted. Blurring of vision, eye pain and discomfort are the main symptoms."
Hepatitis A,"Pain in the liver area, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, fatigue, loss of appetite, decreased appetite, aversion to oily food, jaundice","Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue. Some people or animals with hepatitis have no symptoms, whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hepatitis is acute if it resolves within six months, and chronic if it lasts longer than six months. Acute hepatitis can resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or (rarely) result in acute liver failure. Chronic hepatitis may progress to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer."
Spontaneous Hemothorax,"Bloody pleural effusion, headache, hemothorax, abnormal breathing, arrhythmia, cough, dizziness, pneumothorax, pericardial effusion, protruding sternum, palpitations, rapid and weak pulse","A hemothorax (derived from hemo- [blood] + thorax [chest], plural hemothoraces) is an accumulation of blood within the pleural cavity. The symptoms of a hemothorax may include chest pain and difficulty breathing, while the clinical signs may include reduced breath sounds on the affected side and a rapid heart rate. Hemothoraces are usually caused by an injury, but they may occur spontaneously due to cancer invading the pleural cavity, as a result of a blood clotting disorder, as an unusual manifestation of endometriosis, in response to pneumothorax, or rarely in association with other conditions.
Hemothoraces are usually diagnosed using a chest X-ray, but they can be identified using other forms of imaging including ultrasound, a CT scan, or an MRI. They can be differentiated from other forms of fluid within the pleural cavity by analysing a sample of the fluid, and are defined as having a hematocrit of greater than 50% that of the person's blood. Hemothoraces may be treated by draining the blood using a chest tube."
Pulmonary Cryptococcosis,"Fever, cough, purulent sputum, dyspnea, expectoration, nodules, erythema nodosum, respiratory failure, recurrent pneumonia, anemia, jaundice","Cryptococcosis is a potentially fatal fungal infection of mainly the lungs, presenting as a pneumonia, and in the brain, where it appears as a meningitis. Coughing, difficulty breathing, chest pain and fever are seen when the lungs are infected. When the brain is infected, symptoms include headache, fever, neck pain, nausea and vomiting, light sensitivity and confusion or changes in behavior. It can also affect other parts of the body including skin, where it may appear as several fluid-filled nodules with dead tissue.
It is caused by the fungi Cryptococcus neoformans or less commonly Cryptococcus gattii, and is acquired by breathing in the spores from the air."
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in the Elderly,"Joint effusion, joint pain, limited joint mobility, joint deformity","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal cells that build up in the bone marrow and blood and interfere with normal blood cell production. Symptoms may include feeling tired, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. Occasionally, spread may occur to the brain, skin, or gums. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly, and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.
Risk factors include getting older, being male, smoking, previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy, myelodysplastic syndrome, and exposure to the chemical benzene."
Parosteal Osteosarcoma,"Clinically minor symptoms, may be painless, presenting only as a lump, slow growth, dysfunction in later stages, fatigue, and weight loss","An osteosarcoma (OS) or osteogenic sarcoma (OGS) is a cancerous tumor in a bone. Specifically, it is an aggressive malignant neoplasm that arises from primitive transformed cells of mesenchymal origin (and thus a sarcoma) and that exhibits osteoblastic differentiation and produces malignant osteoid.
Osteosarcoma is the most common histological form of primary bone sarcoma. It is most prevalent in teenagers and young adults.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Many patients first complain of pain that may be worse at night, may be intermittent and of varying intensity and may have been occurring for a long time."
Adolescent Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding (DUB),"Irregular vaginal bleeding, varying amounts of bleeding, dizziness, palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, edema, and loss of appetite","Abnormal uterine bleeding is vaginal bleeding from the uterus that is abnormally frequent, lasts excessively long, is heavier than normal, or is irregular. The term ""dysfunctional uterine bleeding"" was used when no underlying cause was present. Quality of life may be negatively affected.
The underlying causes may be structural or non-structural and are classified in accordance with the FIGO system 1 & 2. Common causes include: Ovulation problems, fibroids, the lining of the uterus growing into the uterine wall, uterine polyps, underlying bleeding problems, side effects from birth control, or cancer."
Superficial Thrombophlebitis of the Limbs,"Varicose veins in the upper limbs and face, edema, cyanosis, local venous tenderness, local venous cord-like induration, nodules","Superficial thrombophlebitis is a thrombosis and inflammation of superficial veins presenting as a painful induration (thickening) with erythema, often in a linear or branching configuration with a cordlike appearance.:8267
Superficial thrombophlebitis is due to inflammation and/or thrombosis, and, less commonly, infection of the vein. It is generally a benign, self-limiting disorder; however, it can be complicated by deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and even pulmonary embolism (PE) Migratory superficial thrombophlebitis is known as Trousseau's syndrome, which can be an early sign of cancer.
When it (rarely) occurs on the breast or anterior chest wall it has been called Mondor's disease. It sometimes occurs in the arm or penis.:827 In axilla, this condition is known as axillary web syndrome.


== Eponym ==
Mondor's disease is named after Henri Mondor (18851962), a surgeon in Paris, France who first described the disease in 1939."
Coital Cephalalgia,Headache during sexual intercourse,"Sexual headache is a type of headache that occurs in the skull and neck during sexual activity, including masturbation or orgasm. These headaches are usually benign, but occasionally are caused by intracranial hemorrhage and cerebral infarction, especially if the pain is sudden and severe. They may be caused by general exertion, sexual excitement, or contraction of the neck and facial muscles. Most cases can be successfully treated with medication.


== Signs and symptoms ==
According to the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD), which terms this condition primary headache associated with sexual activity, it normally begins as a dull headache that increases with sexual excitement, and becomes intense at orgasm, which is called sexual benign headache."
Gastric Cancer in the Elderly,"Anemia, weight loss, nausea and vomiting, decreased appetite, upper abdominal discomfort, persistent pain in the upper and middle abdomen, bloating","Stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, is a malignant tumor of the stomach. It is a cancer that develops in the lining of the stomach. Most cases of stomach cancers are gastric carcinomas, which can be divided into a number of subtypes, including gastric adenocarcinomas. Lymphomas and mesenchymal tumors may also develop in the stomach. Early symptoms may include heartburn, upper abdominal pain, nausea, and loss of appetite."
Diffuse Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma,"Pleural effusion, pleural metastasis, cough, chest pain, bloody pleural fluid, dry cough, chest oppression, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing","Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium). The area most commonly affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding each testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly."
Pneumocystis Pneumonia,"Shortness of breath, coughing, cyanosis, three-concave sign, difficulty breathing, restlessness, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, fever, dry cough","Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), also known as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), is a form of pneumonia that is caused by the yeast-like fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii.
Pneumocystis specimens are commonly found in the lungs of healthy people although it is usually not a cause for disease. However, they are a source of opportunistic infection and can cause lung infections in people with a weak immune system or other predisposing health conditions. PCP is seen in people with HIV/AIDS (who account for 30-40% of PCP cases), those using medications that suppress the immune system, and people with cancer, autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, and chronic lung disease.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms may develop over several days or weeks and may include: shortness of breath and/or difficulty breathing (of gradual onset), fever, dry/non-productive cough, weight loss, night sweats, chills, and fatigue."
Neurocutaneous Syndrome,"Skin itching, numbness, and reduced sensation in localized tissues","Phakomatoses, also known as neurocutaneous syndromes, are a group of multisystemic diseases that most prominently affect structures primarily derived from the ectoderm such as the central nervous system, skin and eyes. The majority of phakomatoses are single-gene disorders that may be inherited in an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked pattern. Presentations may vary dramatically between patients with the same particular syndrome due to mosaicism, variable expressivity, and penetrance.
Many phakomatoses are caused by mutations which alter functioning of the RASmitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway that regulates cellular growth, differentiation, proliferation and death. This results in a tendency for individuals with these mutations to develop various types of benign or malignant tumors depending on the particular mutation."
Urethral Cancer,"Urethral bleeding, emaciation, anemia","Urethral cancer is a rare cancer originating from the urethra. The disease has been classified by the TNM staging system and the World Health Organization.
Symptoms include blood in the urine, lump at end of penis, or bloody penile discharge.
Diagnosis is established by transurethral biopsy.
The most common type is papillary urothelial carcinoma."
Bone Cancer,"Hard mass, fever, weight loss, fatigue","A bone tumor is an abnormal growth of tissue in bone, traditionally classified as noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant). Cancerous bone tumors usually originate from a cancer in another part of the body such as from lung, breast, thyroid, kidney and prostate.  There may be a lump, pain, or neurological signs from pressure. A bone tumor might present with a pathologic fracture. Other symptoms may include fatigue, fever, weight loss, anemia and nausea."
Orbital Mucocoele,"Chills, diplopia, cyst, mucocoele, ptosis of the upper eyelid, headache, ophthalmoplegia, enophthalmos","This list of dog diseases is a selection of diseases and other conditions found in the dog. Some of these diseases are unique to dogs or closely related species, while others are found in other animals, including humans. Not all of the articles listed here contain information specific to dogs. Articles with non-dog information are marked with an asterisk (*).


== Infectious diseases ==


=== Viral infections ===
Rabies (hydrophobia) is a fatal viral disease that can affect any mammal, although the close relationship of dogs with humans makes canine rabies a zoonotic concern."
Malignant Hemangioendothelioma,"Palpitations, cutaneous hemangioma-like lesions","Hemangioendotheliomas are a family of vascular neoplasms of intermediate malignancy.


== Signs and symptoms ==
They have been described as masses that fall between a hemangioma and angiosarcoma.  They are vascular tumors that commonly present with an enlarging mass and most commonly involve the lungs, liver, and musculoskeletal system, although many other body sites have been reported, including the head and neck, intestines, lymph nodes, pleura, retroperitoneum, heel, stomach.


== Cause ==
Possibly Bartonella spp bacteraemia


== Diagnosis ==


=== Classification ===
Hemangioendotheliomas may be classified as:

Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is an uncommon vascular tumor of intermediate malignancy that was first described by Steven Billings, Andrew Folpe, and Sharon Weiss in 2003. These tumors are so named because their histologic appearance resembles a proliferation of epithelioid cells, with polygonal shape and eosinophilic cytoplasm."
Acute Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID),"Lower abdominal pain, chills, high fever, headache, loss of appetite","Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), also known as pelvic inflammatory disorder, is an infection of the upper part of the female reproductive system, mainly the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often, there may be no symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present, may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, bleeding after sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long-term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.
The disease is caused by bacteria that spread from the vagina and cervix."
Pituitary Adenoma,"Amenorrhea, galactorrhea, infertility, decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, breast development, sparse facial hair, headache","Pituitary adenomas are tumors that occur in the pituitary gland. Most pituitary tumors are benign, approximately 35% are invasive and just 0.1% to 0.2% are carcinomas. Pituitary adenomas represent from 10% to 25% of all intracranial neoplasms, with an estimated prevalence rate in the general population of approximately 17%.
Non-invasive and non-secreting pituitary adenomas are considered to be benign in the literal as well as the clinical sense, though a 2011 meta-analysis of available research showed that research to either support or refute this assumption was scant and of questionable quality.
Adenomas exceeding 10 mm (0.39 in) in size are defined as macroadenomas, while those smaller than 10 mm (0.39 in) are referred to as microadenomas."
Melioidosis Pneumonia,"Fever, diarrhea, cough, expectoration, chest pain, interlobar fissures often present as arc-shaped droop, hemoptysis, pulmonary infection, nausea and vomiting, bronchoalveolar sounds, abdominal pain, purulent pulmonary infection","Melioidosis is an infectious disease caused by a gram-negative bacterium called Burkholderia pseudomallei.  Most people exposed to B. pseudomallei experience no symptoms, but complications can range from fever and skin changes to pneumonia, abscesses, and septic shock, which can be fatal. Approximately 10% of people with melioidosis develop symptoms that last longer than two months, termed ""chronic melioidosis"".
Humans are infected with B. pseudomallei by contact with contaminated soil or water. The bacteria enter the body through wounds, inhalation, or ingestion."
Pediatric Digitalis Poisoning,"Nausea and vomiting, arrhythmias, coma, drowsiness, xanthopsia (yellow vision), fixed pupils, abdominal pain, hallucinations","Hyperkalemia is an elevated level of potassium (K+) in the blood. Normal potassium levels are between 3.5 and 5.0 mmol/L (3.5 and 5.0 mEq/L) with levels above 5.5 mmol/L defined as hyperkalemia. Typically hyperkalemia does not cause symptoms. Occasionally when severe it can cause palpitations, muscle pain, muscle weakness, or numbness. Hyperkalemia can cause an abnormal heart rhythm which can result in cardiac arrest and death."
Polymorphic Light Eruption,"Papules, pruritus, polymorphic erythema","Polymorphous light eruption (PLE)  presents with itchy red small bumps on sun-exposed skin, particularly face, neck, forearms and legs. It generally appears 30 minutes to a few hours after sun exposure and may last between one and 14 days.  The bumps may become small blisters or plaques and may appear bloody,often healing with minimal scarring. 
It is a non-life-threatening and potentially distressing skin condition that is triggered by sunlight and artificial UV exposure in a genetically susceptible person, particularly in temperate climates during the spring and early summer. Due to its many clinical appearances, it is named polymorphic or polymorphous and the terms are used interchangeably."
Cerebral Arteriosclerosis with Psychiatric Disorders,"Neurasthenia syndrome, memory impairment, attention deficit, dizziness and headache, fatigue, dementia, clouded consciousness, limb numbness, and personality changes","Vascular dementia is dementia caused by a series of strokes. Restricted blood flow due to strokes reduces oxygen and glucose delivery to the brain, causing cell injury and neurological deficits in the affected region. Subtypes of vascular dementia include subcortical vascular dementia, multi-infarct dementia, stroke-related dementia, and mixed dementia.
Subcortical vascular dementia occurs from damage to small blood vessels in the brain. Multi-infarct dementia results from a series of small strokes affecting several brain regions."
Toothache,"Tooth pain, gingival swelling, dental caries, facial swelling","Toothaches, also known as dental pain or tooth pain, is pain in the teeth or their supporting structures, caused by dental diseases or pain referred to the teeth by non-dental diseases. When severe it may impact sleep, eating, and other daily activities.
Common causes include inflammation of the pulp, (usually in response to tooth decay, dental trauma, or other factors), dentin hypersensitivity, apical periodontitis (inflammation of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone around the root apex), dental abscesses (localized collections of pus), alveolar osteitis (""dry socket"", a possible complication of tooth extraction), acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (a gum infection), and temporomandibular disorder.
Pulpitis is reversible when the pain is mild to moderate and lasts for a short time after a stimulus (for instance cold); or irreversible when the pain is severe, spontaneous, and lasts a long time after a stimulus. Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, then progress to pulp necrosis (death of the pulp) and apical periodontitis."
Purulent Meningitis,"Meningeal irritation signs, headache, abnormal pupil, decreased hearing, irregular breathing, dysphagia, chills, infectious fever, general malaise, cough, runny nose, sore throat","Lumbar puncture (LP), also known as a spinal tap, is a medical procedure in which a needle is inserted into the spinal canal, most commonly to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for diagnostic testing. The main reason for a lumbar puncture is to help diagnose diseases of the central nervous system, including the brain and spine. Examples of these conditions include meningitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage. It may also be used therapeutically in some conditions. Increased intracranial pressure (pressure in the skull) is a contraindication, due to risk of brain matter being compressed and pushed toward the spine."
Acute Gastric Dilatation,"Abdominal distension, upper abdominal pain, periumbilical pain, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, agitation, shortness of breath, limb convulsions, hypotension, splash sounds, shock","Gastric dilatation volvulus (GDV), also known as gastric dilation, twisted stomach, or gastric torsion, is a medical condition that affects dogs and rarely cats and guinea pigs, in which the stomach becomes overstretched and rotated by excessive gas content. The condition also involves compression of the  diaphragm and caudal vena cavae. The word bloat is often used as a general term to mean gas distension without stomach torsion (a normal change after eating), or to refer to GDV.
GDV is a life-threatening condition in dogs that requires prompt treatment. It is common in certain breeds; deep-chested and large dog breeds are especially at risk. Mortality rates in dogs range from 10 to 60%, even with treatment."
Testicular Tumor,"Testicular swelling and pain, scrotal heaviness, reducible mass in the inguinal region, joint pain, cough with difficulty breathing, gynecomastia","Testicular cancer is cancer that develops in the testicles, a part of the male reproductive system. Symptoms may include a lump in the testicle or swelling or pain in the scrotum. Treatment may result in infertility.
Risk factors include an undescended testis, family history of the disease, and previous history of testicular cancer. More than 95% are germ cell tumors which are divided into seminomas and non-seminomas."
Diabetic Cardiomyopathy,"Arrhythmias, angina, cardiomegaly, atrioventricular block, heart failure","Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a disorder of the heart muscle in people with diabetes. It can lead to inability of the heart to circulate blood through the body effectively, a state known as heart failure(HF), with accumulation of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) or legs (peripheral edema). Most heart failure in people with diabetes results from coronary artery disease, and diabetic cardiomyopathy is only said to exist if there is no coronary artery disease to explain the heart muscle disorder.


== Signs and symptoms ==
One particularity of diabetic cardiomyopathy is the long latent phase, during which the disease progresses but is completely asymptomatic. In most cases, diabetic cardiomyopathy is detected with concomitant hypertension or coronary artery disease."
Mediastinal Hodgkin's Lymphoma,"Fever, chest pain unrelated to breathing, tightness, cough without sputum, difficulty breathing, hoarseness, pain in the affected area after drinking alcohol","The B-cell lymphomas are types of lymphoma affecting B cells.  Lymphomas are ""blood cancers"" in the lymph nodes. They develop more frequently in older adults and in immunocompromised individuals.
B-cell lymphomas include both Hodgkin's lymphomas and most non-Hodgkin lymphomas. They are typically divided into low and high grade, typically corresponding to indolent (slow-growing) lymphomas and aggressive lymphomas, respectively."
Pancreatic Cystadenoma and Cystadenocarcinoma,"Upper abdominal distention and pain, dull pain, palpable mass in the upper abdomen, weight loss, jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding","Cystadenoma (or ""cystoma"") is a type of cystic adenoma. When malignant, it is called cystadenocarcinoma.

=== By form ===
serous cystadenoma (8441-8442)
papillary cystadenoma (8450-8451, 8561)
mucinous cystadenoma (8470-8473)


=== By location ===
Bile duct cystadenoma (8161) or biliary cystadenoma is a slow-growing tumour arising from bile ducts of the liver. The presence of endocrine cells in the tumour also indicates its origin from the glands surrounding the bile ducts."
Pneumococcal Pneumonia,"High fever, chills, muscle soreness, poor appetite, fatigue, restlessness, moaning, and shortness of breath","Pneumococcal pneumonia is a type of bacterial pneumonia that is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). It is the most common bacterial pneumonia found in adults, the most common type of community-acquired pneumonia, and one of the common types of pneumococcal infection. The estimated number of Americans with pneumococcal pneumonia is 900,000 annually, with almost 400,000 cases hospitalized and fatalities accounting for 5-7% of these cases.


== Symptoms ==
The symptoms of pneumococcal pneumonia can occur suddenly, presenting as a severe chill, followed by a severe fever, cough, shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and chest pains. Other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, and muscle aches could also accompany initial symptoms."
Hemochromatosis Arthropathy,"Joint crepitus and pain, abdominal pain, spasms and dull pain in fingers (toes) and shins, thickened and relaxed upper eyelids, enlarged finger joints, abnormal pigmentation, abnormal breathing, elbow dislocation, and emaciation","Hereditary haemochromatosis type 1 (HFE-related haemochromatosis) is a genetic disorder characterized by excessive intestinal absorption of dietary iron, resulting in a pathological increase in total body iron stores. Humans, like most animals, have no mechanism to regulate excess iron, simply losing a limited amount through various means like sweating or menstruating.
Excess iron accumulates in tissues and organs, disrupting their normal function. The most susceptible organs include the liver, heart, pancreas, skin, joints, gonads, thyroid and pituitary gland; patients can present with cirrhosis, polyarthropathy, hypogonadism, heart failure, or diabetes.
There are five types of hereditary hemochromatosis: type 1, 2 (2A, 2B), 3, 4 and 5, all caused by mutated genes."
Chronic Subdural Hematoma,"Varying degrees of head injury history, hemiparesis, and aphasia commonly developing several months after injury","A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a type of bleeding in which a collection of bloodusually but not always associated with a traumatic brain injurygathers between the inner layer of the dura mater and the arachnoid mater of the meninges surrounding the brain. It usually results from rips in bridging veins that cross the subdural space.
Subdural hematomas may cause an increase in the pressure inside the skull, which in turn can cause compression of and damage to delicate brain tissue. Acute subdural hematomas are often life-threatening. Chronic subdural hematomas have a better prognosis if properly managed."
Tracheobronchial Foreign Body,"Choking cough, chest tightness, cyanosis, expectoration, hoarseness, respiratory obstruction, tracheal injury, purulent sputum, vomiting, lung infection, hemoptysis","Choking, also known as foreign body airway obstruction (FBAO), is a phenomenon that occurs when breathing is impeded by a blockage inside of the respiratory tract. An obstruction that prevents oxygen from entering the lungs results in oxygen deprivation. Although oxygen stored in the blood and lungs can keep a person alive for several minutes after breathing stops, choking often leads to death.
Around 4,500 to 5,000 choking-related deaths occur in the United States every year. Deaths from choking most often occur in the very young (children under three years old) and in the elderly (adults over 75 years)."
Sickle Cell Nephropathy,"Hematuria, proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, dactylitis, nephrotic syndrome, chest pain, dehydration, arthralgia, skin ulcers, body pain, acute kidney failure, fever","Sickle cell nephropathy is a type of kidney disease associated with sickle cell disease which causes kidney complications as a result of sickling of red blood cells in the small blood vessels. The hypertonic and relatively hypoxic environment of the renal medulla, coupled with the slower blood flow in the vasa recta, favors sickling of red blood cells, with resultant local infarction (papillary necrosis). Functional tubule defects in patients with sickle cell disease are likely the result of partial ischemic injury to the renal tubules.
In younger patients, the disease is characterized by renal hyperperfusion, glomerular hypertrophy, and glomerular hyperfiltration. Some of these individuals eventually develop a glomerulopathy leading to glomerular proteinuria (present in as many as 30%) and, in some, the nephrotic syndrome."
Cervical Firearm Foreign Body,"Septicemia, Trauma, Coma, Abscess, Paralysis, Shock, Asphyxia","Hanging is killing a person by suspending them from the neck with a noose or ligature. Hanging has been a standard method of capital punishment since the Middle Ages, and has been the primary execution method in numerous countries and regions. The first known account of execution by hanging is in Homer's Odyssey. Hanging is also a method of suicide.


== Methods of judicial hanging ==
There are numerous methods of hanging in execution that instigate death either by cervical fracture or by strangulation."
Colonic Leiomyoma,"Changes in bowel habits, abdominal mass, abdominal pain, shock, distention pain","A leiomyoma, also known as a fibroid, is a benign smooth muscle tumor that very rarely becomes cancer (0.1%). They can occur in any organ, but the most common forms occur in the uterus, small bowel, and the esophagus. Polycythemia may occur due to increased erythropoietin production as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome.
The word is from leio- + myo- + -oma, 'smooth-muscle tumor'. The plural form can be either the English leiomyomas or the classical leiomyomata."
Intravascular Papillary Endothelial Hyperplasia (IPEH),"Diffuse swelling of the skin on the head, neck, or limbs, or subcutaneous tumors","Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia (IPEH), also known as Masson's hemangio-endotheliome vegetant intravasculaire, Masson's lesion, Masson's pseudoangiosarcoma, Masson's tumor, and papillary endothelial hyperplasia, is a rare, benign tumor.  It may mimic an angiosarcoma, with lesions that are red or purplish 5-mm to 5-cm papules and deep nodules on the head, neck, or upper extremities.:592
The cause of intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia is unknown. Risk factors include a history of local trauma or prior vascular disorders.
Immunohistochemistry and histopathology are used to make the diagnosis of intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia. Differential diagnosis includes vascular malformation, angioma, pyogenic granuloma, angiosarcoma, epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, Kaposis sarcoma, and other more rare vascular tumors."
Neurointervention,"Headache, dizziness, vertigo, blurred vision","Bryn Mawr Hospital, part of Main Line Health, is a 264-bed acute care hospital located in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1893, Bryn Mawr Hospital has been named among U.S. News & World Reports Best Hospitals in the Philadelphia region.

Pediatric Acute Appendicitis,"Fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, lethargy, chills, seizures, and toxic shock","Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. Symptoms commonly include right lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever and decreased appetite. However, approximately 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms. Severe complications of a ruptured appendix include widespread, painful inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall and sepsis.
Appendicitis is primarily caused by a blockage of the hollow portion in the appendix."
Paraneoplastic Neuromyopathy,"Numbness in the distal extremities, pain or peculiar sensations, severe myasthenia gravis, spinal muscular atrophy, cerebellar ataxia, weakness in the limbs, glove or stocking pattern of sensory loss, both superficial and deep, myogenic muscle weakness","Kidney cancer, also known as renal cancer, is a group of cancers that starts in the kidney. Symptoms may include blood in the urine, a lump in the abdomen, or back pain. Fever, weight loss, and tiredness may also occur. Complications can include spread to the lungs or brain.
The main types of kidney cancer are renal cell cancer (RCC), transitional cell cancer (TCC), and Wilms' tumor."
Nipple Papilloma,Papillary hyperplasia of the nipple,"A papilloma (plural papillomas or papillomata) (papillo- + -oma) is a benign epithelial tumor growing exophytically (outwardly projecting) in nipple-like and often finger-like fronds. In this context, papilla refers to the projection created by the tumor, not a tumor on an already existing papilla (such as the nipple).
When used without context, it frequently refers to infections (squamous cell papilloma) caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), such as warts. Human papillomavirus infection is a major cause of cervical cancer, vulvar cancer, vaginal cancer, penis cancer, anal cancer, and HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers. Most viral warts are caused by human papillomavirus infection (HPV), of which there are nearly 200 distinct human papillomaviruses (HPVs), and many HPV types are carcinogenic."
Adrenal Crisis,"Fever, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, tachycardia, dehydration, coma, somnolence, abdominal pain, diarrhea, weakness","Adrenal crisis, also known as Addisonian crisis or acute adrenal insufficiency, is a life-threatening complication of adrenal insufficiency. Hypotension and hypovolemic shock are the main symptoms of an adrenal crisis. Other symptoms include weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever, fatigue, abnormal electrolytes, confusion, and coma. Laboratory testing may detect low sodium, high potassium, high lymphocyte count, high eosinophils, low blood sugar, and rarely high calcium. The biggest trigger for adrenal crisis is gastrointestinal illness."
Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH),"Difficulty breathing, cyanosis, aggravated after feeding, vomiting","Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a birth defect of the diaphragm.  The most common type of CDH is a Bochdalek hernia;  other types include Morgagni hernia, diaphragm eventration and central tendon defects of the diaphragm.  Malformation of the diaphragm allows the abdominal organs to push into the chest cavity, hindering proper lung formation.
CDH is a life-threatening pathology in infants and a major cause of death due to two complications: pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension.  Experts disagree on the relative importance of these two conditions, with some focusing on hypoplasia, others on hypertension."
Pediatric Chronic Renal Failure,"Polyuria, oliguria, hyperkalemia, decreased glomerular filtration rate, anuria, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, myocardial hypertrophy, arrhythmia, pericarditis, anemia","Kidney failure, also known as renal failure or end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is a medical condition in which the kidneys can no longer adequately filter waste products from the blood, functioning at less than 15% of normal levels. Kidney failure is classified as either acute kidney failure, which develops rapidly and may resolve; and chronic kidney failure, which develops slowly and can often be irreversible. Symptoms may include leg swelling, feeling tired, vomiting, loss of appetite, and confusion. Complications of acute and chronic failure include uremia, hyperkalemia, and volume overload. Complications of chronic failure also include heart disease, high blood pressure, and anaemia."
Hemorrhagic Stroke,"Dizziness, headache, nausea and vomiting, restlessness, impaired limb mobility, consciousness disorders, and even coma","Stroke is a medical condition in which poor blood flow to a part of the brain causes cell death. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding. Both cause parts of the brain to stop functioning properly.
Signs and symptoms of stroke may include an inability to move or feel on one side of the body, problems understanding or speaking, dizziness, or loss of vision to one side. Signs and symptoms often appear soon after the stroke has occurred."
Acute Diffuse Peritonitis,"Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, high fever, profuse sweating, dry mouth, tachycardia, and shallow, rapid breathing","Peritonitis is inflammation of the localized or generalized peritoneum, the lining of the inner wall of the abdomen and covering of the abdominal organs. Symptoms may include severe pain, swelling of the abdomen, fever, or weight loss. One part or the entire abdomen may be tender. Complications may include shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Causes include perforation of the intestinal tract, pancreatitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, stomach ulcer, cirrhosis, a ruptured appendix or even a perforated gallbladder."
Traumatic Tracheobronchial Injury,"Abnormal breathing, cyanosis, pneumothorax, chest pain","Tracheobronchial injury is damage to the tracheobronchial tree (the airway structure involving the trachea and bronchi). It can result from blunt or penetrating trauma to the neck or chest, inhalation of harmful fumes or smoke, or aspiration of liquids or objects.
Though rare, TBI is a serious condition; it may cause obstruction of the airway with resulting life-threatening respiratory insufficiency. Other injuries accompany TBI in about half of cases. Of those people with TBI who die, most do so before receiving emergency care, either from airway obstruction, exsanguination, or from injuries to other vital organs."
Splenic Benign Tumor,"Upper left abdominal mass, pain, postprandial fullness, palpitations, shortness of breath, secondary splenomegaly-induced anemia, and bleeding symptoms","A splenic tumor is a rare form of tumor that may be malignant or benign. Malignant forms include lymphoma and sarcoma.
Lymphoma is the most common malignant splenic tumor."
Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH),"Anorexia, nausea and vomiting, somnolence, seizures, stupor, coma","Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), also known as the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), is characterized by a physiologically inappropriate release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) either from the posterior pituitary gland, or an ectopic non-pituitary source, such as an ADH-secreting tumor in the lung. Unsuppressed ADH causes a physiologically inappropriate increase in solute-free water being reabsorbed by the tubules of the kidney to the venous circulation leading to hypotonic hyponatremia (a low plasma osmolality and low sodium levels).
The causes of SIADH are commonly grouped into categories including: central nervous system diseases that directly stimulate the hypothalamus to release ADH, various cancers that synthesize and secrete ectopic ADH, various lung diseases, numerous drugs (carbamazepine, cyclophosphamide, SSRIs) that may stimulate the release of ADH, vasopressin release, desmopressin release, oxytocin, or stimulation of vasopressin receptor 2 on the kidney (the site of ADH action). Inappropriate antidiuresis may also be due to acute stressors such as exercise, pain, severe nausea or during the post-operative state. In 1760% of people, the cause of inappropriate antidiuresis is never found."
Arsenic Poisoning,"Throat burning pain, hoarse cough, abdominal pain, convulsions, difficulty breathing, numbness in limbs, weakness, drooping wrists and ankles, skin flushing and swelling, loss of appetite, dry mouth and throat","Arsenic poisoning (or arsenicosis) is a medical condition that occurs due to elevated levels of arsenic in the body. If arsenic poisoning occurs over a brief period of time, symptoms may include vomiting, abdominal pain, encephalopathy, and watery diarrhea that contains blood. Long-term exposure can result in thickening of the skin, darker skin, abdominal pain, diarrhea, heart disease, numbness, and cancer.
The most common reason for long-term exposure is contaminated drinking water. Groundwater most often becomes contaminated naturally; however, contamination may also occur from mining or agriculture."
Cryptococcal Meningitis,"Fever, headache, vomiting","Cryptococcosis is a potentially fatal fungal infection of mainly the lungs, presenting as a pneumonia, and in the brain, where it appears as a meningitis. Coughing, difficulty breathing, chest pain and fever are seen when the lungs are infected. When the brain is infected, symptoms include headache, fever, neck pain, nausea and vomiting, light sensitivity and confusion or changes in behavior. It can also affect other parts of the body including skin, where it may appear as several fluid-filled nodules with dead tissue.
It is caused by the fungi Cryptococcus neoformans or less commonly Cryptococcus gattii, and is acquired by breathing in the spores from the air."
Renal Artery Occlusion,"Nausea and vomiting, Anuria, Acute renal failure","Ocular ischemic syndrome is the constellation of ocular signs and symptoms secondary to severe, chronic arterial hypoperfusion to the eye. Amaurosis fugax is a form of acute vision loss caused by reduced blood flow to the eye; it may be a warning sign of an impending stroke, as both stroke and retinal artery occlusion can be caused by thromboembolism due to atherosclerosis elsewhere in the body (such as coronary artery disease and especially carotid atherosclerosis). Retinal artery occlusion is also caused by a left atrial thrombus in patients with atrial fibrillation. Consequently, those with transient blurring of vision are advised to urgently seek medical attention for a thorough evaluation of the carotid artery. Anterior segment ischemic syndrome is a similar ischemic condition of anterior segment usually seen in post-surgical cases."
Aseptic Meningitis,"Headache, dizziness, blurred vision","Aseptic meningitis is the inflammation of the meninges, a membrane covering the brain and spinal cord, in patients whose cerebral spinal fluid test result is negative with routine bacterial cultures.  Aseptic meningitis is caused by viruses, mycobacteria, spirochetes, fungi, medications, and cancer malignancies. The testing for both meningitis and aseptic meningitis is mostly the same. A cerebrospinal fluid sample is taken by lumbar puncture and is tested for leukocyte levels to determine if there is an infection and goes on to further testing to see what the actual cause is. The symptoms are the same for both meningitis and aseptic meningitis but the severity of the symptoms and the treatment can depend on the certain cause."
Ulnar Nerve Injury,"Loss of sensation in the little finger, inability to form a perfect 'O' with the thumb and index finger, loss of sensation in the index finger, sensory disturbances, finger pain and numbness, changes in the skin color and temperature of the limbs, joint pain","The ulnar nerve is a nerve that runs near the ulna, one of the two long bones in the forearm. The ulnar collateral ligament of elbow joint is in relation with the ulnar nerve. The nerve is the largest in the human body unprotected by muscle or bone, so injury is common. This nerve is directly connected to the little finger, and the adjacent half of the ring finger, innervating the palmar aspect of these fingers, including both front and back of the tips, perhaps as far back as the fingernail beds.
This nerve can cause an electric shock-like sensation by striking the medial epicondyle of the humerus posteriorly, or inferiorly with the elbow flexed."
Hydatid Disease,"Affected areas may experience mild pain and a sense of heaviness, decreased appetite, weight loss, emaciation, developmental disorders, skin itching, urticaria, and edema.","Alveolar hydatid disease (AHD) is a form of echinococcosis, or a disease that originates from a parasitic flatworm. AHD is caused by an infection of the flatworm species Echinococcus multilocularis. Although alveolar echinococcosis is rarely diagnosed in humans and is not as widespread as cystic echinococcosis (caused by Echinococcus granulosus), it is also still a serious disease that has a significantly high fatality rate. It is considered one of the most life-threatening helminthic infections humans can have.
It is most prevalent in China, Eastern France, Switzerland, Austria, Bulgaria, Turkey, Iran, Japan, Afghanistan, and Russia, and is mostly confined to the Northern hemisphere, south to around the 40th or 45th degree of Northern latitude, save some cases reported in Northern Africa."
Orbital Cellulitis,"High fever, chills, and symptoms of meningeal irritation","Orbital cellulitis  is inflammation of eye tissues behind the orbital septum. It is most commonly caused by an acute spread of infection into the eye socket from either the adjacent sinuses or through the blood. It may also occur after trauma.  When it affects the rear of the eye, it is known as retro-orbital cellulitis.
Without proper treatment, orbital cellulitis may lead to serious consequences, including permanent loss of vision or even death."
Spermatocytic Tumor,"Testicular tenderness, testicular swelling pain, testicular pain","Spermatocytic tumor, previously called spermatocytic seminoma, is a neoplasm of the testis (i.e. a tumour of the testis), and classified as a germ cell tumour.
The name of the tumour comes from the similarity (under the microscope) between the small cells of the tumour and secondary spermatocytes.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Spermatocytic tumor is a rare tumour, making up only one to two percent of all testicular germ cell tumours.  Men presenting with this tumour are generally 50 to 60 years old, and its occurrence is rare in men under 30 years old."
Bladder Tumor,"Intermittent, painless, gross hematuria","Bladder cancer is the abnormal growth of cells in the bladder. These cells can grow to form a tumor, which eventually spreads, damaging the bladder and other organs. Most people with bladder cancer are diagnosed after noticing blood in their urine. Those suspected of having bladder cancer typically have their bladder inspected by a thin medical camera, a procedure called cystoscopy. Suspected tumors are removed and examined to determine if they are cancerous."
Ectropion,Eyelid eversion,"Ectropion is a medical condition in which the lower eyelid turns outwards. It is one of the notable aspects of newborns exhibiting congenital harlequin-type ichthyosis, but ectropion can occur due to any weakening of tissue of the lower eyelid. The condition can be repaired surgically. Ectropion is also found in dogs as an inherited, developmental condition.


== Causes ==
Congenital
Aging
Scarring
Mechanical
Allergic
Facial nerve palsy
Anti-cancer treatments such as erlotinib, cetuximab, and panitumumab, which block the function of EGFR (the epidermal growth factor receptor)."
Congenital Bronchogenic Cyst,"Fever, cough, purulent sputum, hemoptysis, cyanosis, abnormal breathing, expectoration, and dyspnea on inspiration","Bronchogenic cysts are small, solitary cysts or sinuses, most typically located in the region of the suprasternal notch or behind the manubrium.:682


== Clinical features ==
These cysts are mostly found in young adults and are rare in infancy. The usual symptoms are the result of compression by the cyst, e.g., difficulty breathing or swallowing, cough, and chest pain. Malignant degeneration has been reported in these cysts on rare occasions. Bronchogenic cysts are usually found in the middle mediastinum. Chest x-rays show a smooth density just in front of the trachea or main stem bronchi at the carinal level."
Hemorrhagic Cerebral Infarction,"Headaches, vertigo, nausea and vomiting, limb paralysis, consciousness disorders, pupillary changes, gastrointestinal bleeding, high fever","Infarction is tissue death (necrosis) due to inadequate blood supply to the affected area. It may be caused by artery blockages, rupture, mechanical compression, or vasoconstriction. The resulting lesion is referred to as an infarct
(from the Latin infarctus, ""stuffed into"").


== Causes ==

Infarction occurs as a result of prolonged ischemia, which is the insufficient supply of oxygen and nutrition to an area of tissue due to a disruption in blood supply. The blood vessel supplying the affected area of tissue may be blocked due to an obstruction in the vessel (e.g., an arterial embolus, thrombus, or atherosclerotic plaque), compressed by something outside of the vessel causing it to narrow (e.g., tumor, volvulus, or hernia), ruptured by trauma causing a loss of blood pressure downstream of the rupture, or vasoconstricted, which is the narrowing of the blood vessel by contraction of the muscle wall rather than an external force (e.g., cocaine vasoconstriction leading to myocardial infarction)."
Multi-Infarct Dementia,"Headache, dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, easy fatigue, decreased concentration","Vascular dementia is dementia caused by a series of strokes. Restricted blood flow due to strokes reduces oxygen and glucose delivery to the brain, causing cell injury and neurological deficits in the affected region. Subtypes of vascular dementia include subcortical vascular dementia, multi-infarct dementia, stroke-related dementia, and mixed dementia.
Subcortical vascular dementia occurs from damage to small blood vessels in the brain. Multi-infarct dementia results from a series of small strokes affecting several brain regions."
Cancer Pain,"Pain, nausea, vomiting, cachexia","Pain in cancer may arise from a tumor compressing or infiltrating nearby body parts; from treatments and diagnostic procedures; or from skin, nerve and other changes caused by a hormone imbalance or immune response. Most chronic (long-lasting) pain is caused by the illness and most acute (short-term) pain is caused by treatment or diagnostic procedures. However, radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy may produce painful conditions that persist long after treatment has ended.
The presence of pain depends mainly on the location of the cancer and the stage of the disease. At any given time, about half of all people diagnosed with malignant cancer are experiencing pain, and two-thirds of those with advanced cancer experience pain of such intensity that it adversely affects their sleep, mood, social relations and activities of daily living."
Adrenal Insufficiency,"Fatigue, lethargy, decreased appetite, nausea, weight loss, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension","Adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce adequate amounts of steroid hormones. The adrenal glandsalso referred to as the adrenal cortexnormally secrete glucocorticoids (primarily cortisol), mineralocorticoids (primarily aldosterone), and androgens. These hormones are important in regulating blood pressure, electrolytes, and metabolism as a whole. Deficiency of these hormones leads to symptoms ranging from abdominal pain, vomiting, muscle weakness and fatigue, low blood pressure, depression, mood and personality changes (in mild cases) to organ failure and shock (in severe cases). Adrenal crisis may occur if a person having adrenal insufficiency experiences stresses, such as an accident, injury, surgery, or severe infection; this is a life-threatening medical condition resulting from severe deficiency of cortisol in the body."
Electrocution,"Cardiac arrest, shock, hypotension","Electrocution is death or severe injury  caused by electric shock from electric current passing through the body. The word is derived from ""electro"" and ""execution"", but it is also used for accidental death.
The term ""electrocution"" was coined in 1889 in the US just before the first use of the electric chair and originally referred to only electrical execution and not other electrical deaths. However, since no English word was available for non-judicial deaths due to electric shock, the word ""electrocution"" eventually took over as a description of all circumstances of electrical death from the new commercial electricity.


== Origins ==

In the Netherlands, in 1746, Pieter van Musschenbroek's lab assistant, Andreas Cuneus, received an extreme shock while working with a leyden jar, the first recorded injury from human-made electricity."
Polycythemia Vera,"Increased red blood cells, increased white blood cells, increased platelets, hepatosplenomegaly, nosebleeds, gum bleeding, erythromelalgia, dizziness, headache, hypertension","In oncology, polycythemia vera (PV) is an uncommon myeloproliferative neoplasm in which the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells.  The majority of cases are caused by mutations in the JAK2 gene, most commonly resulting in a single amino acid change in its protein product from valine to phenylalanine at position 617.
Most of the health concerns associated with polycythemia vera are caused by the blood being thicker as a result of the increased red blood cells.  It is more common in the elderly and may be symptomatic or asymptomatic.  Common signs and symptoms include itching (pruritus), and severe burning pain in the hands or feet that is usually accompanied by a reddish or bluish coloration of the skin."
Myocardial Infarction,"Chest pain accompanied by chest tightness, palpitations, panic attacks, and shortness of breath","A myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops in one of the coronary arteries of the heart, causing infarction (tissue death) to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is retrosternal chest pain or discomfort that classically radiates to the left shoulder, arm, or jaw. The pain may occasionally feel like heartburn. This is the dangerous type of acute coronary syndrome.
Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, feeling tired, and decreased level of consciousness."
Choroidal Hemorrhage,"A rare complication of intraocular surgery, agitation, severe pain","Intraocular hemorrhage (sometimes called hemophthalmos or hemophthalmia) is bleeding inside the eye (oculus in Latin). Bleeding can occur from any structure of the eye where there is vasculature or blood flow, including the anterior chamber, vitreous cavity, retina, choroid, suprachoroidal space, or optic disc.
Intraocular hemorrhage may be caused by physical trauma (direct injury to the eye); ocular surgery (such as to repair cataracts); or other diseases, injuries, or disorders (such as diabetes, hypertension, or shaken baby syndrome). Severe bleeding may cause high pressure inside the eye, leading to blindness.


== Types ==
Intraocular hemorrhage is classified based on the location of the bleeding:

Hyphema (in the anterior chamber)
Suprachoroidal hemorrhage (SCH) is a rare complication of intraocular surgery in which blood from the ciliary arteries enters the space between the choroid and the sclera."
Atrophic Hair Follicle Keratosis,"Skin follicular papules, pigmentation, hair loss or alopecia, slight skin hardness, insect-bite-like atrophic small pits, distributed on the eyebrows, cheeks, and forehead.","Actinic keratosis (AK), sometimes called solar keratosis or senile keratosis, is a pre-cancerous area of thick, scaly, or crusty skin. Actinic keratosis is a disorder (-osis) of epidermal keratinocytes that is induced by ultraviolet (UV) light exposure (actin-). 
These growths are more common in fair-skinned people and those who are frequently in the sun. They are believed to form when skin gets damaged by UV radiation from the sun or indoor tanning beds, usually over the course of decades. Given their pre-cancerous nature, if left untreated, they may turn into a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma."
Esophageal Cancer,"Sense of choking when swallowing, burning behind the sternum, pinprick sensation, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss","Esophageal cancer (American English) or oesophageal cancer (British English) is cancer arising from the esophagusthe food pipe that runs between the throat and the stomach. Symptoms often include difficulty in swallowing and weight loss. Other symptoms may include pain when swallowing, a hoarse voice, enlarged lymph nodes (""glands"") around the collarbone, a dry cough, and possibly coughing up or vomiting blood.
The two main sub-types of the disease are esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (often abbreviated to ESCC), which is more common in the developing world, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which is more common in the developed world. A number of less common types also occur."
Rectal Prolapse,"Rectal prolapse, sensation of incomplete evacuation, anal heaviness, urgency followed by relief after defecation, anal pain, rectal bleeding","A rectal prolapse occurs when walls of the rectum have prolapsed to such a degree that they protrude out of the anus and are visible outside the body. However, most researchers agree that there are 3 to 5 different types of rectal prolapse, depending on whether the prolapsed section is visible externally, and whether the full or only partial thickness of the rectal wall is involved.
Rectal prolapse may occur without any symptoms, but depending upon the nature of the prolapse there may be mucous discharge (mucus coming from the anus), rectal bleeding, degrees of fecal incontinence, and obstructed defecation symptoms.
Rectal prolapse is generally more common in elderly women, although it may occur at any age and in either sex. It is very rarely life-threatening, but the symptoms can be debilitating if left untreated."
Pediatric Pancreatic Insufficiency and Neutropenia Syndrome,"Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, increased neutrophils, pasty diarrhea","Clostridial necrotizing enteritis (CNE) is a severe and potentially fatal type of food poisoning caused by a -toxin of Clostridium perfringens, Type C. It occurs in some developing regions, particularly in New Guinea, where it is known as pig-bel. The disease was also documented in Germany following World War II, where it was called Darmbrand (literally ""bowel fire,"" or bowel necrosis). The toxin is normally inactivated by certain proteolytic enzymes and by normal cooking, but when these protections are impeded by diverse factors, and high protein is consumed, the disease can emerge.
Sporadic and extremely rare cases occur in diabetics. In New Guinea, where people generally have low-protein diets apart from tribal feasts, a number of factorsdiet and endemic helminth infections among themcompound to result in pig-bel."
Pancreatic Head Cancer,"Upper abdominal discomfort, dull pain, weight loss, jaundice, skin itching","Pancreatic cancer arises when cells in the pancreas, a glandular organ behind the stomach, begin to multiply out of control and form a mass. These cancerous cells have the ability to invade other parts of the body. A number of types of pancreatic cancer are known.
The most common, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, accounts for about 90% of cases, and the term ""pancreatic cancer"" is sometimes used to refer only to that type. These adenocarcinomas start within the part of the pancreas that makes digestive enzymes."
Primary Mediastinal Tumors,"Chest oppression, chest pain, coughing, shortness of breath, dyspnea, cyanosis, hoarseness","A mediastinal tumor is a tumor in the mediastinum, the cavity that separates the lungs from the rest of the chest. It contains the heart, esophagus, trachea, thymus, and aorta. The most common mediastinal masses are thymoma (20% of mediastinal tumors), usually found in the anterior mediastinum, followed by neurogenic Timor (1520%) located in the anterior mediastinum. Lung cancer typically spreads to the lymph nodes in the mediastinum.
The mediastinum has three main  parts: the anterior mediastinum (front), the middle mediastinum, and the posterior mediastinum (back)."
Pediatric Dilated Cardiomyopathy,"Heart failure, arrhythmias, fatigue, poor appetite, tachycardia, difficulty breathing, abdominal pain, oliguria, electrophysiological abnormalities, edema, respiratory abnormalities, prone to syncope","Cardiomyopathy is a group of primary diseases of the heart muscle. Early on there may be few or no symptoms. As the disease worsens, shortness of breath, feeling tired, and swelling of the legs may occur, due to the onset of heart failure. An irregular heart beat and fainting may occur. Those affected are at an increased risk of sudden cardiac death."
Pulmonary Interstitial Fibrosis,"Shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, dry cough, pain behind the sternum, chest pain, nodules, abnormal respiration, expectoration","Pulmonary fibrosis is a condition in which the lungs become scarred over time. Symptoms include shortness of breath, a dry cough, feeling tired, weight loss, and nail clubbing. Complications may include pulmonary hypertension, respiratory failure, pneumothorax, and lung cancer.
Causes include environmental pollution, certain medications, connective tissue diseases, infections, and interstitial lung diseases. But in most cases the cause is unknown (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis)."
Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML),"Axillary lymphadenopathy, sternal tenderness, bone marrow suppression, leukocytosis, cough, skin infiltration, hepatomegaly, fever, splenomegaly, abdominal distension, eosinophilia, persistent fever of relaxation phase","Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare form of chronic leukemia (cancer of the blood) that affects children, commonly those aged four and younger. The name JMML now encompasses all diagnoses formerly referred to as juvenile chronic myeloid leukemia (JCML), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia of infancy, and infantile monosomy 7 syndrome. The average age of patients at diagnosis is two (2) years old. The World Health Organization has included JMML as a subcategory of myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative disorders.


== Signs and symptoms ==
The following symptoms are typical ones that lead to testing for JMML, though children with JMML may exhibit any combination of them:

pallor
fever
infection
bleeding
cough
poor weight gain
a maculopapular rash (discolored but not raised, or small and raised but not containing pus)
lymphadenopathy
moderate hepatomegaly
marked splenomegaly
leukocytosis
absolute monocytosis
anemia
thrombocytopenia
Most of these conditions show common nonspecific signs and symptoms."
Massive Hemoptysis,"Cough, expectoration, dyspnea, hemoptysis","Hemoptysis or haemoptysis is the discharge of blood or blood-stained mucus through the mouth coming from the bronchi, larynx, trachea, or lungs. It does not necessarily involve coughing. In other words, it is the airway bleeding. This can occur with lung cancer, infections such as tuberculosis, bronchitis, or pneumonia, and certain cardiovascular conditions. Hemoptysis is considered massive at 300 mL (11 imp fl oz; 10 US fl oz)."
Cutaneous Leiomyoma,"Under cold stimuli, the skin lesions present with wrinkling, nodules, papules, and pain.","A leiomyoma, also known as a fibroid, is a benign smooth muscle tumor that very rarely becomes cancer (0.1%). They can occur in any organ, but the most common forms occur in the uterus, small bowel, and the esophagus. Polycythemia may occur due to increased erythropoietin production as part of a paraneoplastic syndrome.
The word is from leio- + myo- + -oma, 'smooth-muscle tumor'. The plural form can be either the English leiomyomas or the classical leiomyomata."
Vulvar Intraepithelial Neoplasia (VIN),"Symptoms of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia include vulvar itching and burning sensation, vulvar nodules, skin thickening and plaques, the surface of papillomas or small warts may appear grayish-white, hyperpigmented, or dark red. The tumoral surface is often dry and scaly with unclear boundaries.","Vulvar cancer is a cancer of the vulva, the outer portion of the female genitals. It most commonly affects the labia majora. Less often, the labia minora, clitoris, or Bartholin's glands are affected. Symptoms include a lump, itchiness, changes in the skin, or bleeding from the vulva.
Risk factors include vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), HPV infection, genital warts, smoking, and many sexual partners."
Lichen Sclerosus,"Itching, dyspareunia, and a burning sensation in the vulvar area","Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease, of unknown cause, which can affect any body part of any person, but has a strong preference for the genitals (penis, vulva), and is also known as balanitis xerotica obliterans when it affects the penis. Lichen sclerosus is not contagious. There is a well-documented increase of skin cancer risk in LS, potentially improvable with treatment. LS in adult age women is normally incurable, although treatment can lessen its effects, and it often gets progressively worse if not treated properly. Most males with mild or intermediate disease, restricted to foreskin or glans, can be cured by either medical or surgical treatment."
Aneurysmal Bone Cyst,"Bone cyst, paraplegia, bone destruction, joint effusion","Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) is a non-cancerous bone tumor composed of multiple varying sizes of spaces in a bone which are filled with blood. The term is a misnomer, as the lesion is neither an aneurysm nor a cyst. It generally presents with pain and swelling in the affected bone. Pressure on neighbouring tissues may cause compression effects such as neurological symptoms.
The cause is unknown."
Anterior Spinal Artery Syndrome,"Lower back pain, sensory disturbances, gastrointestinal bloating, paralysis, persistent dull pain in the lower back","Anterior spinal artery syndrome (also known as ""anterior spinal cord syndrome"") is syndrome caused by ischemia of the area supplied by the  anterior spinal artery, resulting in loss of function of the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord. The region affected includes the descending  corticospinal tract, ascending spinothalamic tract, and autonomic fibers. It is characterized by a corresponding loss of motor function, loss of pain and temperature sensation, and hypotension.
Anterior spinal artery syndrome is the most common form of spinal cord infarction. The anterior spinal cord is at increased risk for infarction because it is supplied by the single anterior spinal artery and has little collateral circulation, unlike the posterior spinal cord which is supplied by two posterior spinal arteries."
Pericardial Metastasis,"Dyspnea, cardiomegaly, jugular venous distension, pulsus paradoxus, hypotension, pleural effusion, cough, chest pain","Metastasis is a pathogenic agent's spreading from an initial or primary site to a different or secondary site within the host's body; the term is typically used when referring to metastasis by a cancerous tumor.  The newly pathological sites, then, are metastases (mets). It is generally distinguished from cancer invasion, which is the direct extension and penetration by cancer cells into neighboring tissues.
Cancer occurs after cells are genetically altered to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. This uncontrolled proliferation by mitosis produces a primary heterogeneic tumour."
Vegetative State,"Coma, loss of consciousness","A vegetative state (VS)  or post-coma unresponsiveness (PCU) is a disorder of consciousness in which patients with severe brain damage are in a state of partial arousal rather than true awareness. After four weeks in a vegetative state, the patient is classified as being in a persistent vegetative state (PVS). This diagnosis is classified as a permanent vegetative state some months (three in the US and six in the UK) after a non-traumatic brain injury or one year after a traumatic injury. The term unresponsive wakefulness syndrome may be used alternatively, as ""vegetative state"" has some negative connotations among the public. It is occasionally also called Apallic syndrome or Apallisches syndrome, borrowings from German, primarily in European or older sources."
Sclerema Neonatorum,"Cyanosis, breathing difficulty, pallor, heat exhaustion, renal failure, edema, hypothermia, microcirculatory disorders","Sclerema neonatorum is a rare and severe skin condition that is characterized by diffuse hardening of the subcutaneous tissue with minimal inflammation.
Sclerema neonatorum is categorized as a kind of panniculitis that appears as subcutaneous adipose tissue and skin hardening. The hardened skin and subcutaneous fat stick to the underlying bone and muscle so much that it makes it difficult to breathe and eat, and it usually results in death.
Severe respiratory or gastrointestinal disorders, congenital malformations, dehydration, and sepsis are among the comorbid conditions that affect affected infants. Sclerema neonatorum usually has a very bad prognosis and a high death rate."
Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia,"High fever with chills, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, abscess, myalgia, turbinate hypertrophy, rales, pruritus in the nasal vestibule, pulmonary infection, pustule, nasal vestibular cyst","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common encapsulated, Gram-negative, aerobicfacultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium that can cause disease in plants and animals, including humans. A species of considerable medical importance, P. aeruginosa is a multidrug resistant pathogen recognized for its ubiquity, its intrinsically advanced antibiotic resistance mechanisms, and its association with serious illnesses  hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and various sepsis syndromes. P. aeruginosa is able to selectively inhibit various antibiotics from penetrating its outer membrane - and has high resistance to several antibiotics. According to the World Health Organization P. aeruginosa poses one of the greatest threats to humans in terms of antibiotic resistance.
The organism is considered opportunistic insofar as serious infection often occurs during existing diseases or conditions  most notably cystic fibrosis and traumatic burns."
Oligohydramnios,"Pregnant women often experience abdominal pain during fetal movements, examinations reveal a smaller abdominal circumference and uterine height compared to other pregnant women at the same stage, high uterine sensitivity, minor stimulations can induce contractions, severe labor pains after the onset of labor, uncoordinated contractions, slow dilation of the cervix, and prolonged labor.","Oligohydramnios is a medical condition in pregnancy characterized by a deficiency of amniotic fluid, the fluid that surrounds the fetus in the abdomen, in the amniotic sac. The limiting case is anhydramnios, where there is a complete absence of amniotic fluid. It is typically diagnosed by ultrasound when the amniotic fluid index (AFI) measures less than 5 cm or when the single deepest pocket (SDP) of amniotic fluid measures less than 2 cm. Amniotic fluid is necessary to allow for normal fetal movement, lung development, and cushioning from uterine compression. Low amniotic fluid can be attributed to a maternal, fetal, placental or idiopathic cause and can result in poor fetal outcomes including death."
Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome,"Posterior embryotoxon, central corneal opacity, headache, dizziness, and blurred vision","AxenfeldRieger syndrome is a rare  autosomal dominant disorder, which affects the development of the teeth, eyes, and abdominal region.
AxenfeldRieger syndrome is part of the so-called iridocorneal or anterior segment dysgenesis syndromes, which were formerly known as anterior segment cleavage syndromes, anterior chamber segmentation syndromes or mesodermal dysgenesis. Although the exact classification of this set of signs and symptoms is somewhat confusing in current scientific literature, most authors agree with the classification cited here. Axenfeld Anomaly is known as the development of a posterior embryotoxon, associated with strands of the iris adhered to a Schwalbe line that has been displaced anteriorly, which when added to glaucoma is called Axenfeld Syndrome. Rieger's Anomaly is defined by a universe of congenital anomalies of the iris, such as iris hypoplasia, corectopia or polycoria."
Acute Septic Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis,"High fever, headache, nausea and vomiting, coma, inability of the eyeballs to move voluntarily, sore throat, obstruction of the superior vena cava flow","Cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is the formation of a blood clot within the cavernous sinus, a cavity at the base of the brain which drains deoxygenated blood from the brain back to the heart. This is a rare disorder and can be of two typesseptic cavernous thrombosis and aseptic cavernous thrombosis. The most common form is septic cavernous sinus thrombosis. The cause is usually from a spreading infection in the nose, sinuses, ears, or teeth. Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus are often the associated bacteria."
Intervertebral Disc Infection,"Lower back pain, chills, high fever, nerve root irritation, severe pain, tenderness, loss of appetite","An intervertebral disc (British English), also spelled intervertebral disk (American English), lies between adjacent vertebrae in the vertebral column. Each disc forms a fibrocartilaginous joint (a symphysis), to allow slight movement of the vertebrae, to act as a ligament to hold the vertebrae together, and to function as a shock absorber for the spine.


== Structure ==

Intervertebral discs consist of an outer fibrous ring, the anulus (or annulus) fibrosus disci intervertebralis, which surrounds an inner gel-like center, the nucleus pulposus. 
The anulus fibrosus consists of several layers (laminae) of fibrocartilage made up of both type I and type II collagen. Type I is concentrated toward the edge of the ring, where it provides greater strength."
Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"Squamous cell carcinoma, ulcers, nodules","Squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC),  also known as epidermoid carcinoma, comprises a number of different types of cancer that begin in squamous cells. These cells form on the surface of the skin, on the lining of hollow organs in the body, and on the lining of the respiratory and digestive tracts.
The squamous-cell carcinomas of different body sites can show differences in their presented symptoms, natural history, prognosis, and response to treatment.


== By body location ==
Human papillomavirus infection has been associated with SCCs of the oropharynx, lung, fingers, and anogenital region.


=== Head and neck cancer ===

About 90% of cases of head and neck cancer (cancer of the mouth, nasal cavity, nasopharynx, throat and associated structures) are due to SCC.


=== Skin ===
Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma is the second most common skin cancer, accounting for over 1 million cases in the United States each year."
Immunodeficiency Diseases,"Slow or stalled growth and development, lupus-like erythematous rash, persistent oral candidiasis, chronic oral ulcers, ataxia","Immunodeficiency, also known as immunocompromise, is a state in which the immune system's ability to fight infectious diseases and cancer is compromised or entirely absent. Most cases are acquired (""secondary"") due to extrinsic factors that affect the patient's immune system. Examples of these extrinsic factors include HIV infection and environmental factors, such as nutrition. Immunocompromisation may also be due to genetic diseases/flaws such as SCID.
In clinical settings, immunosuppression by some drugs, such as steroids, can either be an adverse effect or the intended purpose of the treatment. Examples of such use is in organ transplant surgery as an anti-rejection measure and in patients with an overactive immune system, as in autoimmune diseases."
Pediatric Shock,"Restlessness, rapid breathing, pale complexion, cyanosis, loss of consciousness, clammy skin with seizures, metabolic acidosis, proteinuria","Pediatric advanced life support (PALS) is a course offered by the American Heart Association (AHA) for health care providers who take care of children and infants in the emergency room, critical care and intensive care units in the hospital, and out of hospital (emergency medical services (EMS)). The course teaches healthcare providers how to assess injured and sick children and recognize and treat respiratory distress/failure, shock, cardiac arrest, and arrhythmias.


== Basic Life Support (BLS) ==

PALS builds upon AHA's Pediatric Basic Life Support (BLS). Providers should follow the AHA's Pediatric BLS Algorithms for single and  2 person rescuer. The most essential component of BLS and PALS cardiac arrest care is high quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)."
Sick Sinus Syndrome,"Slowed heart rate, irregular heartbeat","Sinus node dysfunction (SND), also known as sick sinus syndrome (SSS), is a group of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) usually caused by a malfunction of the sinus node, the heart's primary pacemaker. Tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome is a variant of sick sinus syndrome in which the arrhythmia alternates between fast and slow heart rates.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Often sinus node dysfunction produces no symptoms, especially early in the disease course. Signs and symptoms usually appear in more advanced disease and more than 50% of patients will present with syncope or transient near-fainting spells as well as bradycardias that are accompanied by rapid heart rhythms, referred to as tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome Other presenting signs or symptoms can include confusion, fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea. Patients can also present with symptoms of congestive heart failure, stroke or transient ischemic attacks due to the abnormal rhythm."
Acute Perforation of Peptic Ulcer,"Constipation, abdominal pain, shock, nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal distension","Gastrointestinal perforation, also known as gastrointestinal rupture, is a hole in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. The gastrointestinal tract is composed of hollow digestive organs leading from the mouth to the anus. Symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation commonly include severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Complications include a painful inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall and sepsis.
Perforation may be caused by trauma, bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, stomach ulcers, cancer, or infection."
Vascular Dementia in the Elderly,"Memory impairment, inattention, shock, paralysis, forgetfulness, dementia, alexia, pseudobulbar palsy, hallucinations, catatonia, bedridden, hypertension","Vascular dementia is dementia caused by a series of strokes. Restricted blood flow due to strokes reduces oxygen and glucose delivery to the brain, causing cell injury and neurological deficits in the affected region. Subtypes of vascular dementia include subcortical vascular dementia, multi-infarct dementia, stroke-related dementia, and mixed dementia.
Subcortical vascular dementia occurs from damage to small blood vessels in the brain. Multi-infarct dementia results from a series of small strokes affecting several brain regions."
Dilated Cardiomyopathy,"Shortness of breath, fatigue, difficulty breathing","Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a condition in which the heart becomes enlarged and cannot pump blood effectively. Symptoms vary from none to feeling tired, leg swelling, and shortness of breath. It may also result in chest pain or fainting. Complications can include heart failure, heart valve disease, or an irregular heartbeat.
Causes include genetics, alcohol, cocaine, certain toxins, complications of pregnancy, and certain infections."
Cardiac Dysfunction,"Feelings of panic and discomfort in the precordial area, tachycardia, and difficulty breathing at night","Heart failure (HF), also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), is a syndrome caused by an impairment in the heart's ability to fill with and pump blood.
Although symptoms vary based on which side of the heart is affected, HF typically presents with shortness of breath, excessive fatigue, and bilateral leg swelling. The severity of the heart failure is mainly decided based on ejection fraction and also measured by the severity of symptoms. Other conditions that have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver disease, anemia, and thyroid disease.
Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excessive alcohol consumption, infection, and cardiomyopathy."
Hypomagnesemia,"Arrhythmias, muscular weakness, nystagmus, cramps, dizziness, frequent premature beats, restlessness, emotional instability, convulsions, and apathetic behavior","Magnesium deficiency is an electrolyte disturbance in which there is a low level of magnesium in the body. Symptoms include tremor, poor coordination, muscle spasms, loss of appetite, personality changes, and nystagmus. Complications may include seizures or cardiac arrest such as from torsade de pointes. Those with low magnesium often have low potassium.
Causes include low dietary intake, alcoholism, diarrhea, increased urinary loss, and poor absorption from the intestines."
Osteoid Osteoma,"Tibial pain, soft tissue swelling, muscle atrophy, spinal scoliosis, joint pain, bone pain","An osteoid osteoma is a benign (non-cancerous) bone tumor that arises from osteoblasts and some components of osteoclasts. It was originally thought to be a smaller version of an osteoblastoma. Osteoid osteomas tend to be less than 1.5 cm in size. The tumor can be in any bone in the body but are most common in long bones, such as the femur and tibia. They account for 10 to 12 percent of all benign bone tumors and 2 to 3 percent of all abnormal bone growths."
Dwarfism-Retinal Atrophy-Deafness Syndrome,"Abnormal short stature, ataxia, prematurely aged features","Cockayne syndrome (CS), also called Neill-Dingwall syndrome, is a rare and fatal autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by growth failure, impaired development of the nervous system, abnormal sensitivity to sunlight (photosensitivity), eye disorders and premature aging. Failure to thrive and neurological disorders are criteria for diagnosis, while photosensitivity, hearing loss, eye abnormalities, and cavities are other very common features.  Problems with any or all of the internal organs are possible.  It is associated with a group of disorders called leukodystrophies, which are conditions characterized by degradation of neurological white matter. There are two primary types of Cockayne syndrome: Cockayne syndrome type A (CSA), arising from mutations in the ERCC8 gene, and Cockayne syndrome type B (CSB), resulting from mutations in the ERCC6 gene."
Ollier Disease,"Shortening and bending deformities of limbs, forearm bending towards ulnar side, deformities in lower limbs with genu valgum",Ollier disease is a rare sporadic nonhereditary skeletal disorder in which typically benign cartilaginous tumors (enchondromas) develop near the growth plate cartilage. This is caused by cartilage rests that grow and reside within the metaphysis or diaphysis and eventually mineralize over time to form multiple enchondromas.  Key signs of the disorder include asymmetry and shortening of the limb as well as an increased thickness of the bone margin. These symptoms are typically first visible during early childhood with the mean age of diagnosis being 13 years of age. Many patients with Ollier disease are prone to develop other malignancies including bone sarcomas that necessitate treatment and the removal of malignant bone neoplasm.
Small Intestinal Leiomyosarcoma,"Intussusception, dull pain, cachexia, fatigue, abdominal mass, signs of peritoneal irritation, abdominal pain, diarrhea","The average age at which intestinal tumors are diagnosed ranges between 1012 years for cats and 6 to 9 years for dogs. There are many different types of intestinal tumors, including lymphoma, adenocarcinoma, mast cell tumor, and leiomyosarcoma.


== Signs and symptoms ==
The symptoms can vary but include weight loss, diarrhea, vomiting, and anorexia.


== Diagnosis ==
The veterinarian will typically perform a series of tests such as blood tests and imaging studies. The most definitive way to confirm/rule out intestinal tumors is to perform a medical procedure called endoscopy to visualize the organ and do a tissue biopsy."
Secondary glaucoma in aphakic and pseudophakic eyes,"Eye pain, retinal hemorrhage and exudation, blue field entoptic phenomenon, eye fatigue, pupil deformation","Secondary glaucoma is a collection of progressive optic nerve disorders associated with a rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) which results in the loss of vision. In clinical settings, it is defined as the occurrence of IOP above 21 mmHg requiring the prescription of IOP-managing drugs. It can be broadly divided into two subtypes: secondary open-angle glaucoma and secondary angle-closure glaucoma, depending on the closure of the angle between the cornea and the iris. Principal causes of secondary glaucoma include optic nerve trauma or damage, eye disease, surgery, neovascularization, tumours and use of steroid and sulfa drugs. Risk factors for secondary glaucoma include uveitis, cataract surgery and also intraocular tumours."
Ischemic Hepatitis,"Jaundice on lips, massive hepatic necrosis, pain in the upper right abdomen, positive hepatitis B e antibody (anti-HBe), increased gluconeogenesis, abdominal pain, positive hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), loss of appetite, inflammatory cell infiltration, tense liver capsule, jaundice, globulin abnormalities","Ischemic hepatitis, also known as  shock liver, is a condition defined as an acute liver injury caused by insufficient blood flow (and consequently insufficient oxygen delivery) to the liver. The decreased blood flow (perfusion) to the liver is usually due to shock or low blood pressure. However, local causes involving the hepatic artery that supplies oxygen to the liver, such as a blood clot in the hepatic artery, can also cause ischemic hepatitis.


== Signs and symptoms ==
People who develop ischemic hepatitis may have weakness, fatigue, mental confusion, and low urine production (oliguria). A small percentage of affected people may develop hepatic coma."
Pulmonary Fibrosis,"Dyspnea, cyanosis, cough, expectoration, respiratory failure, dry cough, joint pain","Pulmonary fibrosis is a condition in which the lungs become scarred over time. Symptoms include shortness of breath, a dry cough, feeling tired, weight loss, and nail clubbing. Complications may include pulmonary hypertension, respiratory failure, pneumothorax, and lung cancer.
Causes include environmental pollution, certain medications, connective tissue diseases, infections, and interstitial lung diseases. But in most cases the cause is unknown (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis)."
Cervical Vertebral Wedge Compression Fracture,"Cervical spondylotic degeneration, neck pain, cervicalgia, and limited head and neck mobility","A compression fracture is a collapse of a vertebra. It may be due to trauma or due to a weakening of the vertebra (compare with burst fracture). This weakening is seen in patients with osteoporosis or osteogenesis imperfecta, lytic lesions from metastatic or primary tumors, or infection. In healthy patients, it is most often seen in individuals suffering extreme vertical shocks, such as ejecting from an ejection seat. Seen in lateral views in plain x-ray films, compression fractures of the spine characteristically appear as wedge deformities, with greater loss of height anteriorly than posteriorly and intact pedicles in the anteroposterior view."
Diabetic Cardiomyopathy in the Elderly,"Angina, palpitations, dyspnea, tachycardia, chest tightness, arrhythmia, cardiac rupture, hepatosplenomegaly, orthopnea, and rapid heart rate.","Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a disorder of the heart muscle in people with diabetes. It can lead to inability of the heart to circulate blood through the body effectively, a state known as heart failure(HF), with accumulation of fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema) or legs (peripheral edema). Most heart failure in people with diabetes results from coronary artery disease, and diabetic cardiomyopathy is only said to exist if there is no coronary artery disease to explain the heart muscle disorder.


== Signs and symptoms ==
One particularity of diabetic cardiomyopathy is the long latent phase, during which the disease progresses but is completely asymptomatic. In most cases, diabetic cardiomyopathy is detected with concomitant hypertension or coronary artery disease."
Retroperitoneal Liposarcoma,"Abdominal mass, abdominal discomfort, bloating, nausea, vomiting, frequent urination, urgency to urinate, pain during urination, blood in urine, difficulty urinating, urinary retention","Liposarcomas are the most common subtype of soft tissue sarcomas, accounting for at least 20% of all sarcomas in adults. Soft tissue sarcomas are rare neoplasms with over 150 different histological subtypes or forms. Liposarcomas arise from the precursor lipoblasts of the adipocytes (i.e. fat cells) in adipose (i.e. fat) tissues."
Parastomal Hernia of the Sigmoid Colostomy,"Numbness of the lips, abdominal pain, megacolon","A colostomy is an opening (stoma) in the large intestine (colon), or the surgical procedure that creates one. The opening is formed by drawing the healthy end of the colon through an incision in the anterior abdominal wall and suturing it into place. This opening, often in conjunction with an attached ostomy system, provides an alternative channel for feces to leave the body. Thus if the natural anus is unavailable for that function (for example, in cases where it has been removed as part of treatment for colorectal cancer or ulcerative colitis), an artificial anus takes over. It may be reversible or irreversible, depending on the circumstances."
Acute Arterial Embolism in the Elderly,"The '5P's (Pain, Pallor, Pulselessness, Paresthesia, Paralysis), skin pallor, cyanosis, pain, dizziness, abdominal pain, shock, nausea and vomiting, muscle necrosis","Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a blockage of an artery in the lungs by a substance that has moved from elsewhere in the body through the bloodstream (embolism). Symptoms of a PE may include shortness of breath, chest pain particularly upon breathing in, and coughing up blood. Symptoms of a blood clot in the leg may also be present, such as a red, warm, swollen, and painful leg. Signs of a PE include low blood oxygen levels, rapid breathing, rapid heart rate, and sometimes a mild fever. Severe cases can lead to passing out, abnormally low blood pressure, obstructive shock, and sudden death."
Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus,"Vulvar itching, vulvar skin is white or presents with fissures and ulceration; severe cases may lead to labial adhesion and disappearance, affecting sexual life.","Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease, of unknown cause, which can affect any body part of any person, but has a strong preference for the genitals (penis, vulva), and is also known as balanitis xerotica obliterans when it affects the penis. Lichen sclerosus is not contagious. There is a well-documented increase of skin cancer risk in LS, potentially improvable with treatment. LS in adult age women is normally incurable, although treatment can lessen its effects, and it often gets progressively worse if not treated properly. Most males with mild or intermediate disease, restricted to foreskin or glans, can be cured by either medical or surgical treatment."
Orbital Lipoma,"Exophthalmos, conjunctival foreign body sensation","Liposarcomas are the most common subtype of soft tissue sarcomas, accounting for at least 20% of all sarcomas in adults. Soft tissue sarcomas are rare neoplasms with over 150 different histological subtypes or forms. Liposarcomas arise from the precursor lipoblasts of the adipocytes (i.e. fat cells) in adipose (i.e. fat) tissues."
Sepsis and Bacteremia,"High fever, nausea, vomiting","Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are infections of blood caused by blood-borne pathogens. The detection of microbes in the blood (most commonly accomplished by blood cultures) is always abnormal. A bloodstream infection is different from sepsis, which is characterized by severe inflammatory or immune responses of the host organism to pathogens.
Bacteria can enter the bloodstream as a severe complication of infections (like pneumonia or meningitis), during surgery (especially when involving mucous membranes such as the gastrointestinal tract), or due to catheters and other foreign bodies entering the arteries or veins (including during intravenous drug abuse). Transient bacteremia can result after dental procedures or brushing of teeth."
Protein-Losing Enteropathy,"Hypoproteinemia, lower limb edema, indigestion, diarrhea, vitamin deficiency, immune dysfunction","Protein losing enteropathy (PLE) is a syndrome in which blood proteins are lost excessively via the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It may be caused by many different underlying diseases that damage the lining of the GI tract (mucosa) or cause blockage of its lymphatic drainage.


== Signs and symptoms ==
The signs and symptoms of protein losing enteropathy include diarrhea, fever, and general abdominal discomfort. Swelling of the legs due to peripheral edema can also occur; however, if the PLE is related to a systemic disease such as congestive heart failure or constrictive pericarditis, then these symptoms could be due directly to the underlying illness.  In severe cases, anasarca, a generalized form of edema, may develop."
Intraventricular Hemorrhage and Hematoma,"Headache, dizziness, vomiting, papilledema, speech disturbance, urinary incontinence, limb movement disorder, altered consciousness, and even coma","Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), also known as intracranial bleed, is bleeding within the skull. Subtypes are intracerebral bleeds (intraventricular bleeds and intraparenchymal bleeds), subarachnoid bleeds, epidural bleeds, and subdural bleeds.
Intracerebral bleeding affects 2.5 per 10,000 people each year.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Intracranial hemorrhage is a serious medical emergency because the buildup of blood within the skull can lead to increases in intracranial pressure, which can crush delicate brain tissue or limit its blood supply.  Severe increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) can cause brain herniation, in which parts of the brain are squeezed past structures in the skull."
Polymorphic Light Eruption (PLE),"Solar lentigines, erythema, swelling, and pain at exposed sites, burning sensation, mild itching, desquamation, mild hyperpigmentation, erythema, papules, wheals, and blisters","Polymorphous light eruption (PLE)  presents with itchy red small bumps on sun-exposed skin, particularly face, neck, forearms and legs. It generally appears 30 minutes to a few hours after sun exposure and may last between one and 14 days.  The bumps may become small blisters or plaques and may appear bloody,often healing with minimal scarring. 
It is a non-life-threatening and potentially distressing skin condition that is triggered by sunlight and artificial UV exposure in a genetically susceptible person, particularly in temperate climates during the spring and early summer. Due to its many clinical appearances, it is named polymorphic or polymorphous and the terms are used interchangeably."
Diabetes and Hypertension,"Thirst, polyuria, dizziness, headache, weight loss, polyphagia, cephalalgia, lightheadedness","Complications of hypertension are clinical outcomes that result from persistent elevation of blood pressure. Hypertension is a risk factor for all clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis since it is a risk factor for atherosclerosis itself. It is an independent predisposing factor for heart failure, coronary artery disease, stroke, kidney disease, and peripheral arterial disease. It is the most important risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, in industrialized countries.


== Complications affecting the heart ==

Hypertensive heart disease is the result of structural and functional adaptations leading to left ventricular hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, CHF (Congestive Heart Failure), abnormalities of blood flow due to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and microvascular disease, and cardiac arrhythmias."
Blast-induced Hearing Loss,"Deafness, tinnitus, ear pain, headache, dizziness","A blast injury is a complex type of physical trauma resulting from direct or indirect exposure to an explosion. Blast injuries occur with the detonation of high-order explosives as well as the deflagration of low order explosives. These injuries are compounded when the explosion occurs in a confined space.


== Classification ==

Blast injuries are divided into four classes: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary.


=== Primary injuries ===
Primary injuries are caused by blast overpressure waves, or shock waves."
Gastric Polyps,"Upper abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, difficulty swallowing, black stools, abdominal pain, polyps, discomfort in the upper abdomen","A polyp is an abnormal growth of tissue projecting from a mucous membrane. If it is attached to the surface by a narrow elongated stalk, it is said to be pedunculated; if it is attached without a stalk, it is said to be sessile. 
Polyps are commonly found in the colon, stomach, nose, ear, sinus(es), urinary bladder, and uterus. They may also occur elsewhere in the body where there are mucous membranes, including the cervix, vocal folds, and small intestine. Some polyps are tumors (neoplasms) and others are non-neoplastic, for example hyperplastic or dysplastic, which are benign."
Breast Tumor,"Breast lump, breast pain, breast dull pain, nipple discharge, changes in the nipple and areola, changes in breast contour","Breast cancer is a cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, milk rejection, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin.
Risk factors for developing breast cancer include obesity, a lack of physical exercise, alcohol consumption, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, an early age at first menstruation, having children late in life (or not at all), older age, having a prior history of breast cancer, and a family history of breast cancer. About five to ten percent of cases are the result of an inherited genetic predisposition, including BRCA mutations among others."
Uterine Hypertrophy,"Pain in the lumbosacral area or a sense of heaviness in the perineum, excessive menstrual flow","Uterine hyperplasia, or enlarged uterus, is a medical symptom in which the volume and size of the uterus in a female is abnormally high. It can be a symptom of medical conditions such as adenomyosis, uterine fibroids, ovarian cysts, and endometrial cancer."
C5 Deficiency Syndrome,"Decreased immunity, diarrhea, wasting","CD55 deficiency, also called DAF deficiency or CHAPLE syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder of the immune system. CHAPLE stands for ""CD55 deficiency with hyper-activation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and severe protein-losing enteropathy (PLE).""

Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC),"Palpitations, fatigue, exertional dyspnea, lower extremity edema","Cardiomyopathy is a group of primary diseases of the heart muscle. Early on there may be few or no symptoms. As the disease worsens, shortness of breath, feeling tired, and swelling of the legs may occur, due to the onset of heart failure. An irregular heart beat and fainting may occur. Those affected are at an increased risk of sudden cardiac death."
Central Pontine Myelinolysis (CPM),"Liver failure, kidney failure, dehydration, bacterial infections, paralysis, brainstem lesions, demyelination, sensory disorders, hearing loss, nerve damage","Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) is a neurological condition involving severe damage to the myelin sheath of nerve cells in the pons (an area of the brainstem). It is predominately iatrogenic (treatment-induced), and is characterized by acute paralysis,  dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), dysarthria (difficulty speaking), and other neurological symptoms.
Central pontine myelinolysis was first described as a disorder in 1959. The original paper described four cases with fatal outcomes, and the findings on autopsy. The disease was described as a disease of alcoholics and malnutrition."

Symptoms may include feeling tired, pale skin color, fever, easy bleeding or bruising, enlarged lymph nodes, or bone pain. As an acute leukemia, ALL progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.
In most cases, the cause is unknown. Genetic risk factors may include Down syndrome, LiFraumeni syndrome, or neurofibromatosis type 1."
Vitreous Hemorrhage,"Floating dark shadows in front of the eyes, floaters, and decreased vision","Vitreous hemorrhage is the extravasation, or leakage, of blood into the areas in and around the vitreous humor of the eye. The vitreous humor is the clear gel that fills the space between the lens and the retina of the eye. A variety of conditions can result in blood leaking into the vitreous humor, which can cause impaired vision, floaters, and photopsia.


== Symptoms ==
Common symptoms of vitreous hemorrhage include:

Blurred vision
Floaters  faint cobweb-like apparitions floating through the field of vision
Reddish tint to vision
Photopsia  brief flashes of light in the peripheral vision
Small vitreous hemorrhage often manifests itself as ""floaters."" A moderate case will often result in dark streaks in the vision, while dense vitreous hemorrhage can significantly inhibit vision.


== Causes ==
There are many factors known to cause vitreous hemorrhage."

The condition leads to symptoms including loss of balance, slowing of movement, difficulty moving the eyes, and cognitive impairment.  PSP may be mistaken for other types of neurodegeneration such as Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The cause of the condition is uncertain, but involves the accumulation of tau protein within the brain.  Medications such as levodopa and amantadine may be useful in some cases."
Primary Monoclonal Gammopathy Renal Damage,"Proteinuria, edema, hypertension, emaciation, fatigue, hematuria, acute renal failure, nephrotic syndrome, chronic renal failure","Multiple myeloma (MM), also known as plasma cell myeloma and simply myeloma, is a cancer of plasma cells, a type of white blood cell that normally produces antibodies.

== Cause ==
Possibly Bartonella spp bacteraemia


== Diagnosis ==


=== Classification ===
Hemangioendotheliomas may be classified as:

Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma is an uncommon vascular tumor of intermediate malignancy that was first described by Steven Billings, Andrew Folpe, and Sharon Weiss in 2003. These tumors are so named because their histologic appearance resembles a proliferation of epithelioid cells, with polygonal shape and eosinophilic cytoplasm."
Laryngeal Fibroma,"Pain, difficulty breathing",Vaginal melanoma is a rare malignancy that originates from melanocytes in the vaginal epithelium. It is also known as a melanocytic tumor or as a malignant melanoma. It is aggressive and infrequently cured. The median overall survival is 16 months. Vaginal melanoma accounts 5.5% of all vaginal cancers and only 1% of all melanomas diagnosed in women.
Pediatric Preexcitation Syndrome,"Tachycardia, pallor, lethargy, poor appetite, abnormal heart sounds, slow blood flow, arrhythmias, cardiomegaly, faint heart sounds, sudden death","WolffParkinsonWhite syndrome (WPWS) is a disorder due to a specific type of problem with the electrical system of the heart involving an accessory pathway able to conduct electrical current between the atria and the ventricles, thus bypassing the atrioventricular node. About 60% of people with the electrical problem develop symptoms, which may include an abnormally fast heartbeat, palpitations, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, or syncope. Rarely, cardiac arrest may occur. The most common type of irregular heartbeat that occurs is known as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
The cause of WPW is typically unknown and is likely due to a combination of chance and genetic factors."
Chronic Granulomatous Disease,"Eczema, skin granulomas, dermatitis, lymphadenopathy, infectious rhinitis, granuloma, perianal abscess, brain abscess, hepatosplenomegaly, abscess, diarrhea","Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), also known as BridgesGood syndrome, chronic granulomatous disorder, and Quie syndrome, is a diverse group of hereditary diseases in which certain cells of the immune system have difficulty forming the reactive oxygen compounds (most importantly the superoxide radical due to defective phagocyte NADPH oxidase) used to kill certain ingested pathogens. This leads to the formation of granulomas in many organs. CGD affects about 1 in 200,000 people in the United States, with about 20 new cases diagnosed each year.
This condition was first discovered in 1950 in a series of four boys from Minnesota, and in 1957 it was named ""a fatal granulomatosus of childhood"" in a publication describing their disease. The underlying cellular mechanism that causes chronic granulomatous disease was discovered in 1967, and research since that time has further elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease."
Hypermagnesemia,"Constipation, conduction block, nausea, abdominal distension, hypermagnesemia, respiratory failure, respiratory depression, coma","Hypermagnesemia is an electrolyte disorder in which there is a high level of magnesium in the blood. Symptoms include weakness, confusion, decreased breathing rate, and decreased reflexes. Hypermagnesemia can greatly increase the chances of adverse cardiovascular events.  Complications may include low blood pressure and cardiac arrest.
It is typically caused by kidney failure or is treatment-induced such as from antacids or supplements that contain magnesium."
Pancreatic Cancer,"Indigestion, abdominal pain, jaundice, abdominal pain generally not related to diet","Pancreatic cancer arises when cells in the pancreas, a glandular organ behind the stomach, begin to multiply out of control and form a mass. These cancerous cells have the ability to invade other parts of the body. A number of types of pancreatic cancer are known.
The most common, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, accounts for about 90% of cases, and the term ""pancreatic cancer"" is sometimes used to refer only to that type. These adenocarcinomas start within the part of the pancreas that makes digestive enzymes."
Acute Appendicitis in AIDS Patients,"Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, tenderness in the lower right abdomen, pain in the lower right abdomen with vomiting, low-grade fever, abdominal muscle tension, rebound tenderness in the lower abdomen","An acute abdomen refers to a sudden, severe abdominal pain. It is in many cases a medical emergency, requiring urgent and specific diagnosis. Several causes need immediate surgical treatment.


== Differential diagnosis ==
Common causes of an acute abdomen include a gastrointestinal perforation, peptic ulcer disease, mesenteric ischemia, acute cholecystitis, appendicitis, diverticulitis, pancreatitis, and an abdominal hemorrhage. However, this is a non-exhaustive list and other less common causes may also lead to an acute abdomen."
Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia in the Elderly,"Fatigue, general malaise and loss of appetite, dry cough, shortness of breath and chest pain, fever","Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or nosocomial pneumonia refers to any pneumonia contracted by a patient in a hospital at least 4872 hours after being admitted. It is thus distinguished from community-acquired pneumonia. It is usually caused by a bacterial infection, rather than a virus.
Hospital acquired pneumonia is the second most common nosocomial infection (after urinary tract infections) and accounts for 1520% of the total. It is the most common cause of death among nosocomial infections and is the primary cause of death in intensive care units."
Subdural Hematoma,"Coma, impaired consciousness, increased intracranial pressure, headache, cerebral herniation, nausea and vomiting, papilledema, hemiparesis, memory disorders","A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a type of bleeding in which a collection of bloodusually but not always associated with a traumatic brain injurygathers between the inner layer of the dura mater and the arachnoid mater of the meninges surrounding the brain. It usually results from rips in bridging veins that cross the subdural space.
Subdural hematomas may cause an increase in the pressure inside the skull, which in turn can cause compression of and damage to delicate brain tissue. Acute subdural hematomas are often life-threatening. Chronic subdural hematomas have a better prognosis if properly managed."
Gynecological Inflammation,"Increased vaginal discharge, bladder irritation signs, menstrual disorder, lower abdominal distension","Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), also known as pelvic inflammatory disorder, is an infection of the upper part of the female reproductive system, mainly the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often, there may be no symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present, may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, bleeding after sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long-term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.
The disease is caused by bacteria that spread from the vagina and cervix."
Gonococcal Conjunctivitis,"Eye pain, photophobia, tearing, eyelid redness and swelling, conjunctival congestion, edema, and copious purulent discharge","Neisseria gonorrhoeae, also known as gonococcus (singular) or gonococci (plural), is a species of Gram-negative diplococci bacteria first isolated by Albert Neisser in 1879. An  obligate human pathogen, it primarily colonizes the mucosal lining of the urogenital tract; however, it is also capable of adhering to the mucosa of the nose, pharynx, rectum, and conjunctiva. It causes the sexually transmitted genitourinary infection gonorrhea as well as other forms of gonococcal disease including disseminated gonococcemia, septic arthritis, and gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum.
N. gonorrhoeae is oxidase positive and a microaerophile that is capable of surviving phagocytosis and growing inside neutrophils. Culturing it requires carbon dioxide supplementation and enriched agar (chocolate agar) with various antibiotics (ThayerMartin)."
Lower Limb Venous Thrombosis,"Localized pain, aggravation during walking, limb swelling, sharp dorsiflexion of the foot causing deep calf muscle pain","Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a type of venous thrombosis involving the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein, most commonly in the legs or pelvis. A minority of DVTs occur in the arms. Symptoms can include pain, swelling, redness, and enlarged veins in the affected area, but some DVTs have no symptoms. 
The most common life-threatening concern with DVT is the potential for a clot to embolize (detach from the veins), travel as an embolus through the right side of the heart, and become lodged in a pulmonary artery that supplies blood to the lungs. This is called a pulmonary embolism (PE)."
Dermoid Cyst,Nodule,"A dermoid cyst is a teratoma of a cystic nature that contains an array of developmentally mature, solid tissues. It frequently consists of skin, hair follicles, and sweat glands, while other commonly found components include clumps of long hair, pockets of sebum, blood, fat, bone, nail, teeth, eyes, cartilage, and thyroid tissue.
As dermoid cysts grow slowly and contain mature tissue, this type of cystic teratoma is nearly always benign. In those rare cases wherein the dermoid cyst is malignant, a squamous cell carcinoma usually develops in adults, while infants and children usually present with an endodermal sinus tumor.:781


== Location ==
Due to its classification, a dermoid cyst can occur wherever a teratoma can occur.


=== Vaginal and ovarian dermoid cysts ===
Ovaries normally grow cyst-like structures called follicles each month."
Prostatic Calcification,"Frequent urination, urgency, incomplete emptying, urinary retention, hematuria","Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), also called prostate enlargement, is a noncancerous increase in size of the prostate gland. Symptoms may include frequent urination, trouble starting to urinate, weak stream, inability to urinate, or loss of bladder control. Complications can include urinary tract infections, bladder stones, and chronic kidney problems.
The cause is unclear. Risk factors include a family history, obesity, type 2 diabetes, not enough exercise, and erectile dysfunction."
Sebaceous Adenoma,"Painless mass on the skin surface, redness, pain, and purulent discharge from the mass upon infection, accompanied by the discharge of cottage cheese-like fluid","Sebaceous adenomais a type of adenoma, characterized by a slow-growing tumor usually presenting as a pink, flesh-coloured, or yellow papule or nodule.:662


== Significance ==
Sebaceous adenomas, in isolation, are not significant; however, they may be associated with Muir-Torre syndrome, a genetic condition that predisposes individuals to cancer.  It is also linked to hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome).
It is not the same as ""adenoma sebaceum"" by F. Balzer and P.E. Mntrier (1885). The term ""adenoma sebaceum"" is a misnomer for facial angiofibromas associated with tuberous sclerosis complex.

Hodgkin's Disease,"Painless progressive enlargement of superficial lymph nodes, low fever, loss of appetite","Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a type of lymphoma in which cancer originates from a specific type of white blood cell called lymphocytes, where multinucleated ReedSternberg cells (RS cells) are present in the lymph nodes. The condition was named after the English physician Thomas Hodgkin, who first described it in 1832. Symptoms may include fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Often, non-painful enlarged lymph nodes occur in the neck, under the arm, or in the groin. Persons affected may feel tired or be itchy."
Collapse of Yang (),"Hallucinations, visions, mental disorientation, or profuse sweating","Emperor Gaozu of Han (256  1 June 195 BC), also known by his given name Liu Bang, was the founder and first emperor of the Han dynasty, reigning from 202 to 195 BC. He is considered by traditional Chinese historiography to be one of the greatest emperors in history, credited with establishing the first Pax Sinica, one of China's longest golden ages.
Liu Bang was among the few dynastic founders to have been born in a peasant family. He initially entered the Qin dynasty bureaucracy as a minor law enforcement officer in his home town in Pei County, within the conquered state of Chu. During the political chaos following the death of Qin Shi Huang, who had been the first emperor in Chinese history, Liu Bang renounced his civil service position and became a rebel leader, taking up arms against the Qin dynasty. He outmanoeuvred rival rebel leader Xiang Yu to invade the Qin heartland and forced the surrender of the Qin ruler Ziying in 206 BC.
After the fall of the Qin dynasty, Xiang Yu, as the de facto chief of the rebels, divided the former Qin Empire into the Eighteen Kingdoms, with Liu Bang forced to accept control of the poor and remote region of Bashu (present-day Sichuan, Chongqing, and southern Shaanxi), and assuming the title ""King of Han""."
Barbiturate Poisoning,"Coma, dilated pupils, absence of corneal and pharyngeal reflexes","Barbiturate overdose is poisoning due to excessive doses of barbiturates. Symptoms typically include difficulty thinking, poor coordination, decreased level of consciousness, and a decreased effort to breathe (respiratory depression). Complications of overdose can include noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. If death occurs this is typically due to a lack of breathing.
Barbiturate overdose may occur by accident or purposefully in an attempt to cause death."
Mixed Hemorrhoids,"Painless, intermittent fresh red bleeding after defecation, prolapsed hemorrhoidal mass, anal pain, anal itching, mucus leakage, eczema, and pruritus","Pien Tze Huang  (; Pinzihung) is a traditional Chinese herbal formula first documented during the Ming Dynasty and historically used to combat inflammation. In recent years it has been tested on animals for its benefits against various diseases such as multiple sclerosis, cerebral ischemia, carbon-induced liver damage, and cancer.
Side effects have yet to be seen as PZH has not yet been clinically tested. However, it is commonly sold as oral tablets taken daily (for general health) or as a pearl cream (for acne and freckles), and no side effects have been reported.


== Current production ==
The sole manufacturer of Pien Tze Huang is the Zhang Zhou Pien Tze Huang Pharmaceutical Company Limited, China."
Uremia,"Weakness, deep and long breaths, apathetic reactions, delirium, convulsions, mental abnormalities","Uremia is the condition of having high levels of urea in the blood. Urea is one of the primary components of urine. It can be defined as an excess in the blood of amino acid and protein metabolism end products, such as urea and creatinine, which would normally be excreted in the urine. Uremic syndrome can be defined as the terminal clinical manifestation of kidney failure (also called renal failure). It is the signs, symptoms and results from laboratory tests which result from inadequate excretory, regulatory, and endocrine function of the kidneys."
Pediatric Hepatitis D,"Jaundice, hepatomegaly, impaired liver function","Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue. Some people or animals with hepatitis have no symptoms, whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hepatitis is acute if it resolves within six months, and chronic if it lasts longer than six months. Acute hepatitis can resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or (rarely) result in acute liver failure. Chronic hepatitis may progress to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer."
Reticulum Cell Sarcoma,"Bone pain, simple fractures, lymphadenopathy","Contagious reticulum cell sarcoma is a reticulum-cell sarcoma found in Syrian hamsters that can be transmitted from one hamster to another. It was first described in 1945.
Transmission from hamster to hamster can be through various mechanisms. It has been seen to spread within a laboratory population, presumably through gnawing at tumours and cannibalism. It can also be spread by means of the bite of the mosquito Aedes aegypti."
Vaginal wall prolapse,Bladder and urethral protrusion,"Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is characterized by descent of pelvic organs from their normal positions into the vagina. In women, the condition usually occurs when the pelvic floor collapses after gynecological cancer treatment, childbirth or heavy lifting. Injury incurred to fascia membranes and other connective structures can result in cystocele, rectocele or both. Treatment can involve dietary and lifestyle changes, physical therapy, or surgery.


== Types ==

Anterior vaginal wall prolapse
Cystocele (bladder into vagina)
Urethrocele (urethra into vagina)
Cystourethrocele (both bladder and urethra)
Posterior vaginal wall prolapse
Enterocele (small intestine into vagina)
Rectocele (rectum into vagina)
Sigmoidocele
Apical vaginal prolapse
Uterine prolapse (uterus into vagina)
Vaginal vault prolapse (descent of the roof of vagina)  after surgical removal of the uterus hysterectomy


== Grading ==
Pelvic organ prolapses are graded either via the BadenWalker System, Shaw's System, or the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) System."
Vaginal Malignant Tumor,"Vaginal mass prolapse, vaginal bleeding, frequent urination, urinary retention, loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, low-grade fever","Vaginal tumors are neoplasms (tumors) found in the vagina. They can be benign or malignant. A neoplasm is an abnormal growth of tissue that usually forms a tissue mass.
Vaginal neoplasms may be solid, cystic or of mixed type.
Vaginal cancers arise from vaginal tissue, with vaginal sarcomas develop from bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, blood vessels or other connective or supportive tissue."
Pediatric Hepatitis C,"Fever, jaundice, decreased appetite, fatigue, malaise, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever in children.","Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue. Some people or animals with hepatitis have no symptoms, whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hepatitis is acute if it resolves within six months, and chronic if it lasts longer than six months. Acute hepatitis can resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or (rarely) result in acute liver failure. Chronic hepatitis may progress to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer."
Pediatric Fever,"Fever, Cough","Enteric fever is a medical term encompassing two types of salmonellosis, which, specifically, are typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever. Enteric fever is a potentially life-threatening acute febrile systemic infection and is diagnosed by isolating a pathogen on culture. Typhoid fever is caused by the Salmonella enterica bacteria, serotype typhi, while paratyphoid fever is caused by the Salmonella enterica bacteria, serotype paratyphi A, B, or C. These Salmonella enterica bacteria serovars that cause enteric fever only have human hosts, as opposed to other types of salmonellosis-causing Salmonella bacteria  which often have animal reservoirs."
Vaginal Rhabdomyosarcoma,"Vaginal bleeding and vaginal masses, accompanied by serous, mucinous discharge, sometimes bloody","Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a highly aggressive form of cancer that develops from mesenchymal cells that have failed to fully differentiate into myocytes of skeletal muscle. Cells of the tumor are identified as rhabdomyoblasts.
The four subtypes are embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, and spindle-cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma. Embryonal and alveolar are the main groups, and these types are the most common soft tissue sarcomas of childhood and adolescence. The pleomorphic type is usually found in adults."
Neonatal Listeriosis,"Sepsis, back pain, convulsions, diarrhea, ataxia, respiratory distress, coma, immunodeficiency","Listeriosis is a bacterial infection most commonly caused by Listeria monocytogenes, although L. ivanovii and L. grayi have been reported in certain cases. Listeriosis can cause severe illness, including severe sepsis, meningitis, or encephalitis, sometimes resulting in lifelong harm and even death. Those at risk of severe illness are the elderly, fetuses, newborns, and those who are immunocompromised. In pregnant women, it may cause stillbirth or spontaneous abortion, and preterm birth is common. Listeriosis may cause mild, self-limiting gastroenteritis and fever in anyone."
Eosinophilic Adenoma,"The tumor is generally round or oval, with a smooth surface, and some may present as nodular.","Pituitary adenomas are tumors that occur in the pituitary gland. Most pituitary tumors are benign, approximately 35% are invasive and just 0.1% to 0.2% are carcinomas. Pituitary adenomas represent from 10% to 25% of all intracranial neoplasms, with an estimated prevalence rate in the general population of approximately 17%.
Non-invasive and non-secreting pituitary adenomas are considered to be benign in the literal as well as the clinical sense, though a 2011 meta-analysis of available research showed that research to either support or refute this assumption was scant and of questionable quality.
Adenomas exceeding 10 mm (0.39 in) in size are defined as macroadenomas, while those smaller than 10 mm (0.39 in) are referred to as microadenomas."
Periampullary Carcinoma,"jaundice, high fever, chills, generalized pruritus, poor appetite, diarrhea, weight loss","Periampullary cancer is a cancer that forms near the ampulla of Vater, an enlargement of the ducts from the liver and pancreas where they join and enter the small intestine. It consists of:

ampullary tumour from ampulla of Vater
cancer of lower common bile duct
duodenal cancer adjacent to ampulla
carcinoma head of pancreas
It presents with painless jaundice which may have a waxing and waning nature, because at times the sloughing of the tumor tissue relieves the obstruction partially.


== Signs and symptoms of periampullary cancer ==
Signs and symptoms of periampullary cancer include:

Jaundice (yellowing of skin, eyes and urine with pale stools)
Itching
Abdominal pain
Weight loss and loss of appetite
Recurrent vomiting
Black stools
Anemia


== Treatment ==
Source:
The treatment depends upon the stage of the disease and degree of jaundice. Surgery is the best possible option and can be considered if the cancer is diagnosed at a stage where it can be completely removed by surgery. If the jaundice is very high, the surgeon may choose to decrease jaundice before surgery by doing a procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and stenting."
Autosomal Recessive Hereditary Cerebral Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy,"Headache, dizziness, palpitations, shortness of breath, heart palpitations","CADASIL or CADASIL syndrome, involving cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy, is the most common form of hereditary stroke disorder and is thought to be caused by mutations of the NOTCH3 gene on chromosome 19. The disease belongs to a family of disorders called the leukodystrophies. The most common clinical manifestations are migraine headaches and transient ischemic attacks or strokes, which usually occur between 40 and 50 years of age, although MRI is able to detect signs of the disease years prior to clinical manifestation of disease.
The condition was identified and named by French researchers Marie-Germaine Bousser and Elisabeth Tournier-Lasserve in the 1990s. Together with two other researchers, Hugues Chabriat and Anne Joutel, they received the 2019 Brain Prize for their research into the condition."
Gangrene,"Distal ischemia, white and cold toes with numbness and pain, eventually leading to intense burning pain, color transition from red to dark to black, and potentially leading to the falling off of toe joints","Gangrene is a type of tissue death caused by a lack of blood supply. The feet and hands are most commonly affected. If the gangrene is caused by an infectious agent, it may present with a fever or sepsis.
Symptoms may include:

a change in skin color to red or black
numbness
swelling
pain
skin breakdown
coolness
Common risk factors include, but are not limited to, diabetes, peripheral arterial disease, smoking, major trauma, alcoholism, HIV/AIDS, frostbite, influenza, dengue fever, malaria, chickenpox, plague, hypernatremia, radiation injuries, meningococcal disease, Group B streptococcal infection and Raynaud's syndrome.
It can be classified as dry gangrene, wet gangrene, gas gangrene, internal gangrene, and necrotizing fasciitis."
Colorectal Cancer,"Constipation, abdominal mass, anemia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, sticky stool, bloody stool with blood mixed with feces, skin metastasis, melena, extensive pelvic infiltration, and dissemination.","Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as bowel cancer, colon cancer, or rectal cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine). Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, abdominal pain and fatigue. Most colorectal cancers are due to lifestyle factors and genetic disorders. Risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red meat, processed meat, and alcohol."
Urinary Tuberculosis,"Frequent urination, urgent urination, hematuria, pyuria, possible weight loss, low fever, fatigue or anemia","Urogenital tuberculosis, the second most frequent form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, develops in 2-20% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis through hematogenous spread to the kidneys, prostate, and epididymis. The disease follows a descending pattern, spreading through the collecting system to the ureters, bladder, and urethra, and through the ejaculatory ducts to the male sex organs. Though most prevalent in males in their fourth and fifth decades, it can occur at any age and in both males and females.
Characterized by its slow, gradual progression, urogenital tuberculosis often remains without symptoms until reaching advanced stages, frequently resulting in diagnostic delays and significant urogenital organ destruction. The condition's serious but insidious nature is evidenced by cases where renal failure constitutes the initial clinical presentation."
Malignant Hypertension,"Severe headache, nausea and vomiting, tinnitus, edema, palpitations, shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing, agitation, dizziness, palpitations, rapid breathing, and blurred vision","A hypertensive emergency is very high blood pressure with potentially life-threatening symptoms and signs of acute damage to one or more organ systems (especially brain, eyes, heart, aorta, or kidneys). It is different from a hypertensive urgency by this additional evidence for impending irreversible hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD). Blood pressure is often above 200/120 mmHg, however there are no universally accepted cutoff values.


== Signs and symptoms ==

Symptoms may include headache, nausea, or vomiting. Chest pain may occur due to increased workload on the heart resulting in inadequate delivery of oxygen to meet the heart muscle's metabolic needs."
Heat Exhaustion,"High fever, dizziness, confusion, palpitations, shock, coma, seizures, nausea and vomiting, dehydration","Heat exhaustion is a heat-related illness characterized by the body's inability to effectively cool itself, typically occurring in high ambient temperatures or during intense physical exertion. In heat exhaustion, core body temperature ranges from 37 C to 40 C (98.6 F to 104 F). Symptoms include profuse sweating, weakness, dizziness, headache, nausea, and lowered blood pressure, resulting from dehydration and serum electrolyte depletion. Heat-related illnesses lie on a spectrum of severity, where heat exhaustion is considered less severe than heat stroke but more severe than heat cramps and heat syncope.
Climate change and increasing global temperatures have led to more frequent and intense heat waves, raising the incidence of heat exhaustion."
Thyroid Cyst,"Unilateral or bilateral enlargement of the thyroid, which is relatively hard; the shape of the thyroid mostly shows diffuse enlargement, and some may present as nodules.","Thyroid nodules are nodules (raised areas of tissue or fluid) which commonly arise within an otherwise normal thyroid gland. They may be hyperplastic or  tumorous, but only a small percentage of thyroid tumors are malignant. Small, asymptomatic nodules are common, and often go unnoticed. Nodules that grow larger or produce symptoms may eventually need medical care. A goitre may have one nodule  uninodular, multiple nodules  multinodular, or be diffuse."
Chronic Heart Failure,"Post-activity shortness of breath, exertional dyspnea, hepatomegaly, lower limb edema, cardiac failure, coma, shock, abnormal breathing, arrhythmia, syncope, vertigo","Heart failure (HF), also known as congestive heart failure (CHF), is a syndrome caused by an impairment in the heart's ability to fill with and pump blood.
Although symptoms vary based on which side of the heart is affected, HF typically presents with shortness of breath, excessive fatigue, and bilateral leg swelling. The severity of the heart failure is mainly decided based on ejection fraction and also measured by the severity of symptoms. Other conditions that have symptoms similar to heart failure include obesity, kidney failure, liver disease, anemia, and thyroid disease.
Common causes of heart failure include coronary artery disease, heart attack, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, excessive alcohol consumption, infection, and cardiomyopathy."
Ameloblastoma of the Jaw,"Jaw swelling, facial deformity, numbness in the lower lip, nasal congestion","Ameloblastoma is a rare, benign or cancerous tumor of odontogenic epithelium (ameloblasts, or outside portion, of the teeth during development) much more commonly appearing in the lower jaw than the upper jaw. It was recognized in 1827 by Cusack. This type of odontogenic neoplasm was designated as an adamantinoma in 1885 by the French physician Louis-Charles Malassez. It was finally renamed to the modern name ameloblastoma in 1930 by Ivey and Churchill.
While these tumors are rarely malignant or metastatic (that is, they rarely spread to other parts of the body), and progress slowly, the resulting lesions can cause severe abnormalities of the face and jaw leading to severe disfiguration."
Somatostatinoma,"Abdominal mass, abdominal pain, diarrhea, diabetes, dyspepsia, steatorrhea, hyperacidity, gallstones","Somatostatinomas are a tumor of the delta cells of the endocrine pancreas that produces somatostatin. Increased levels of somatostatin inhibit pancreatic hormones and gastrointestinal hormones. Thus, somatostatinomas are associated with mild diabetes mellitus (due to inhibition of insulin release), steatorrhoea and gallstones (due to inhibition of cholecystokinin release), and achlorhydria (due to inhibition of gastrin release). Somatostatinomas are commonly found in the head of pancreas. Only ten percent of somatostatinomas are functional tumours, and 6070% of tumours are malignant."
Ventricular Tachycardia,"Ectopic tachycardia, rapid heartbeat","Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach or VT) is a cardiovascular disorder in which fast heart rate occurs in the ventricles of the heart. Although a few seconds of VT may not result in permanent problems, longer periods are dangerous; and multiple episodes over a short period of time are referred to as an electrical storm. Short periods may occur without symptoms, or present with lightheadedness, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, and decreased level of consciousness. Ventricular tachycardia may lead to coma and persistent vegetative state due to lack of blood and oxygen to the brain. Ventricular tachycardia may result in ventricular fibrillation (VF) and turn into cardiac arrest."
Merkel Cell Carcinoma,"Nasal, Oral, Upper limbs, Lower limbs, Head, Nodal head","Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive skin cancer occurring in about three people per million members of the population. It is also known as cutaneous APUDoma, primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin, primary small cell carcinoma of the skin, and trabecular carcinoma of the skin. Factors involved in the development of MCC include the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV or MCV), a weakened immune system, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Merkel cell carcinoma usually arises on the head, neck, and extremities, as well as in the perianal region and on the eyelid. It is more common in people over sixty years old, Caucasian people, and males."
Breast Cancer,"Breast lump, nipple retraction, distant metastasis of breast cancer","Breast cancer is a cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, milk rejection, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin.
Risk factors for developing breast cancer include obesity, a lack of physical exercise, alcohol consumption, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, an early age at first menstruation, having children late in life (or not at all), older age, having a prior history of breast cancer, and a family history of breast cancer. About five to ten percent of cases are the result of an inherited genetic predisposition, including BRCA mutations among others."
Non-ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI),"Chest pain, angina, myocardial infarction","A myocardial infarction (MI), commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops in one of the coronary arteries of the heart, causing infarction (tissue death) to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is retrosternal chest pain or discomfort that classically radiates to the left shoulder, arm, or jaw. The pain may occasionally feel like heartburn. This is the dangerous type of acute coronary syndrome.
Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, feeling tired, and decreased level of consciousness."
Oral and Maxillofacial Soft Tissue Injury,"Lymphatic rupture, skin abrasion, shock, tissue fluid exudation","Oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMFS) is a surgical specialty focusing on reconstructive surgery of the face, facial trauma surgery, the mouth, head and neck, and jaws, as well as facial plastic surgery including cleft lip and cleft palate surgery.


== Specialty ==
An oral and maxillofacial surgeon is a specialist surgeon who treats the entire craniomaxillofacial complex: anatomical area of the mouth, jaws, face, and skull, head and neck as well as associated structures. Depending upon the national jurisdiction, oral and maxillofacial surgery may require a degree in medicine, dentistry or both.


=== United States ===
In the U.S., oral and maxillofacial surgeons, whether possessing a single or dual degree, may further specialise after residency, undergoing additional one or two year sub-specialty oral and maxillofacial surgery fellowship training in the following areas:

Cosmetic facial surgery, including eyelid (blepharoplasty), nose (rhinoplasty), facial lift, brow lift, and laser resurfacing
Cranio-maxillofacial trauma, including zygomatic (cheek bone), orbital (eye socket), mandibular and nasal fractures as well as facial soft tissue lacerations and penetrating neck injuries
Craniofacial surgery/paediatric maxillofacial surgery, including cleft lip and palate surgery and trans-cranial craniofacial surgery including Fronto-Orbital Advancement and Remodelling (FOAR) and total vault remodelling
Head and neck cancer and microvascular reconstruction free flap surgery
Maxillofacial regeneration, which is re-formation of the facial region by advanced stem cell technique


=== United Kingdom and Europe ===
In countries such as the UK and most of Europe, it is recognised as a specialty of medicine with a degree in medicine and an additional degree in dentistry being compulsory. The scope of practice is mainly head and neck cancer, microvascular reconstruction, craniofacial surgery and cranio-maxillofacial trauma, skin cancer, facial deformity, cleft lip and palate, craniofacial surgery, TMJ surgery and cosmetic facial surgery."
Coxsackievirus Rash,"Fever, rubella-like rash, roseola-like rash, vesicular rash","Coxsackieviruses are a few related enteroviruses that belong to the Picornaviridae family of nonenveloped, linear, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, as well as its genus Enterovirus, which also includes poliovirus and echovirus. Enteroviruses are among the most common and important human pathogens, and ordinarily its members are transmitted by the fecaloral route. Coxsackieviruses share many characteristics with poliovirus. With control of poliovirus infections in much of the world, more attention has been focused on understanding the nonpolio enteroviruses such as coxsackievirus.
Coxsackieviruses are among the leading causes of aseptic meningitis (the other usual suspects being echovirus and mumps virus)."
Primary Intraspinal Tumor,Common symptoms include spinal pain and radicular pain.,"A brain tumor (sometimes referred more commonly as brain cancer) occurs when a group of cells within the brain turn cancerous and grow out of control, creating a mass. There are two main types of tumors: malignant (cancerous) tumors and benign (non-cancerous) tumors. These can be further classified as primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which most commonly have spread from tumors located outside the brain, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the size of the tumor and the part of the brain that is involved. Where symptoms exist, they may include headaches, seizures, problems with vision, vomiting and mental changes."
Clonorchiasis,"Recurrent infections, abnormal appetite, anorexia, malnutrition, obstructive jaundice, biliary colic, impaired memory, insomnia, listlessness, epigastric hidden pain, fullness after meals, fatigue","Clonorchiasis is an infectious disease caused by the Chinese liver fluke (Clonorchis sinensis) and two related species.
Clonorchiasis is a known risk factor for the development of cholangiocarcinoma, a neoplasm of the biliary system.
Symptoms of opisthorchiasis caused by Opisthorchis viverrini and by O. felineus are indistinguishable from clonorchiasis caused by Clonorchis sinensis, leading some to argue that the disease by these three parasites should be referred to collectively as clonorchiasis.


== Signs and symptoms ==


== Cause ==
Clonorchis sinensis is a trematode (fluke) which is part of the phylum Platyhelminthes. The parasitic worm is as long as 10 to 25 mm and lives in the bile ducts of the liver."
Industrial Poisoning-Induced Mental Disorders,"Syncope, wrist drop, glove and stocking-type hypoesthesia, hand tremors, constipation, lead lines on gums, metallic taste in the mouth, hypothermia, drooling, pallor, trembling, consciousness disorders","Lead poisoning, also known as plumbism and saturnism, is a type of metal poisoning caused by lead in the body. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, irritability, memory problems, infertility, numbness and tingling in the hands and feet. It causes almost 10% of intellectual disability of otherwise unknown cause and can result in behavioral problems. Some of the effects are permanent. In severe cases, anemia, seizures, coma, or death may occur."
Laryngeal Cancer,"Hoarseness, dyspnea, cough, difficulty in swallowing","Laryngeal cancer is a kind of cancer that can develop in any part of the larynx (voice box). It is typically a squamous-cell carcinoma, reflecting its origin from the epithelium of the larynx.
The prognosis is affected by the location of the tumour. For the purposes of  staging, the larynx is divided into three anatomical regions: the glottis (true vocal cords, anterior and posterior commissures); the supraglottis (epiglottis, arytenoids and aryepiglottic folds, and false cords); and the subglottis. Most laryngeal cancers originate in the glottis, with supraglottic and subglottic tumours being less frequent."
Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm,"Cough, dysphagia, right heart failure, edema, dyspnea, hoarseness, pain","A thoracic aortic aneurysm is an aortic aneurysm that presents primarily in the thorax.
A thoracic aortic aneurysm is the ""ballooning"" of the upper aspect of the aorta, above the diaphragm. Untreated or unrecognized they can be fatal due to dissection or ""popping"" of the aneurysm leading to nearly instant death. Thoracic aneurysms are less common than an abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, a syphilitic aneurysm is more likely to be a thoracic aortic aneurysm than an abdominal aortic aneurysm."
Neonatal Hemorrhagic Anemia,"Hypovolemic shock, hypotension, sail sign of the placenta, restlessness, ascites, abdominal distension, chills, rapid breathing, jaundice","Pulmonary hemorrhage (or pulmonary haemorrhage) is an acute bleeding from the lung, from the upper respiratory tract and the trachea, and the pulmonary alveoli. When evident clinically, the condition is usually massive. The onset of pulmonary hemorrhage is characterized by a cough productive of blood (hemoptysis) and worsening of oxygenation leading to cyanosis. Treatment should be immediate and should include tracheal suction, oxygen, positive pressure ventilation, and correction of underlying abnormalities such as disorders of coagulation. A blood transfusion may be necessary."
Small Intestinal Adenoma,"Paroxysmal abdominal cryptalgia, dull pain or colic, nausea and vomiting, frequent diarrhea, bloating, partial patients with gastrointestinal bleeding","A colorectal polyp is a polyp (fleshy growth) occurring on the lining of the colon or rectum. Untreated colorectal polyps can develop into colorectal cancer.
Colorectal polyps are often classified by their behaviour (i.e. benign vs. malignant) or cause (e.g."

This histology can present one of 2 clinically distinct ways. Localized/nodular TGCT (L-TGCT), sometimes referred to as giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath;:100 is a common tumor that presents as a slow-growing, encapsulated, localized and limited bump, most frequently in the fingers.  Diffuse TGCT (D-TGCT)  also called pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a rare tumor that presents as a proliferative, destructive, intra-articular lesion, most commonly in the knee.:102  D-TGCT tumors often develop from the lining of joints (also known as synovial tissue).:100:245. Common symptoms of D-TGCT include swelling, pain, stiffness and reduced mobility in the affected joint or limb.:102


== Classification ==
Classification for TGCT encompasses two subtypes that can be divided according to site  within a joint (intra-articular) or outside of the joint (extra-articular)  and growth pattern (localized or diffuse) of the tumor(s).:100:361 Localized and diffuse subsets of TGCT differ in their prognosis, clinical presentation, and biological behavior, but share a similar manner of disease development.:100


=== Localized TGCT ===

Localized TGCT is sometimes referred to as localized pigmented villonodular synovitis (L-PVNS), giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath (GCT-TS), nodular tenosynovitis, localized nodular tenosynovitis, and L-TGCT.:1:100

Turpentine Dermatitis,"Pruritus, papules, mucosal damage, generalized red patches, vesicles","Contact dermatitis is a type of acute or chronic inflammation of the skin caused by exposure to chemical or physical agents. Symptoms of contact dermatitis can include itchy or dry skin, a red rash, bumps, blisters, or swelling. These rashes are not contagious or life-threatening, but can be very uncomfortable.
Contact dermatitis results from either exposure to allergens (allergic contact dermatitis), or irritants (irritant contact dermatitis). Allergic contact dermatitis involves a delayed type of hypersensitivity and previous exposure to an allergen to produce a reaction."
Amyloid Cardiomyopathy,"Edema, palpitations, shortness of breath after activity, rales, arrhythmias, right bundle branch block, poor R wave progression in the precordial leads, chest pain, heart murmurs, atrial premature beats, systemic circulatory congestion, sinoatrial node disease","Amyloid cardiomyopathy (stiff heart syndrome) is a condition resulting in the death of part of the myocardium (heart muscle). It is associated with the systemic production and release of many amyloidogenic proteins, especially immunoglobulin light chain or transthyretin (TTR). It can be characterized by the extracellular deposition of amyloids, foldable proteins that stick together to build fibrils in the heart.


== Symptoms ==
Amyloid cardiomyopathy is associated with a number of symptoms:

diastolic dysfunction
congestive heart failure
arrhythmia
cardiac nervous conduction block
fatigue
dyspnea


== Pathophysiology ==
Amyloid proteins are deposited in the myocardium. This limits ventricular filling during diastole, which increases end-diastolic volume."
Simple Renal Cyst,"Generally asymptomatic, but larger cysts with infections may cause back pain, or occasionally microscopic hematuria. If the cyst is infected and contains stones, there might be percussive pain in the renal area of the affected side.","A renal cyst  is a fluid collection in or on the kidney. There are several types based on the Bosniak classification. The majority are benign, simple cysts that can be monitored and not intervened upon. However, some are cancerous or are suspicious for cancer and are commonly removed in a surgical procedure called nephrectomy.
Numerous renal cysts are seen in the cystic kidney diseases, which include polycystic kidney disease and medullary sponge kidney."
Chronic Ulcerative Non-Granulomatous Jejunoileitis,"Diarrhea, watery stools, steatorrhea, abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, weight loss","Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, abdominal distension, and weight loss. Complications outside of the gastrointestinal tract may include anemia, skin rashes, arthritis, inflammation of the eye, and fatigue. The skin rashes may be due to infections, as well as pyoderma gangrenosum or erythema nodosum. Bowel obstruction may occur as a complication of chronic inflammation, and those with the disease are at greater risk of colon cancer and small bowel cancer."
Light Chain Disease and Light Chain Deposition Disease,"Lymphadenopathy, anemia, fever of unknown origin, weakness, splenomegaly, pathological fractures, associated hypertension, skin purpura, gingival bleeding","Light chain deposition disease (LCDD) is a rare blood cell disease which is characterized by deposition of fragments of infection-fighting immunoglobulins,  called light chains (LCs), in the body. LCs are normally cleared by the kidneys, but in LCDD, these light chain deposits damage organs and cause disease. The kidneys are almost always affected and this often leads to kidney failure.  About half of people with light chain deposition disease also have a plasma cell dyscrasia, a spectrum of diseases that includes multiple myeloma, Waldenstrm's macroglobulinemia, and the monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance premalignant stages of these two diseases.  Unlike in AL amyloidosis, in which light chains are laid down in characteristic amyloid deposits, in LCDD, light chains are deposited in non-amyloid granules."
Idiopathic Acute Tubulointerstitial Nephritis,"Fatigue, anorexia, myalgia, nausea and vomiting, leukocyturia, anemia, proteinuria, hematuria","The chronic kidney disease of the cat (CKD or CNE)  also called chronic renal insufficiency (CRI or CNI) or chronic renal failure (CRF) in the older literature  is an incurable, progressive disease characterized by a gradual decrease in the nephrons and thus to a decreasing function (insufficiency) of the kidneys. It is one of the most common causes of death in older domestic cats. In current literature, the term ""kidney disease"" is preferred to the term ""renal insufficiency"" because the disease initially progresses without any measurable decline in kidney function. Due to the different type of diet and the resulting metabolic peculiarities, the clinical picture and treatment sometimes differ significantly from chronic renal failure in humans.
Chronic kidney disease occurs in cats as a result of inflammation of the renal tubules and the renal interstitial tissue without an identifiable cause (idiopathic tubulointerstitial nephritis)."
Hemolytic Anemia due to Excessive Hemolysis,"Pallor, fatigue, loss of appetite","Hemolytic anemia or haemolytic anaemia is a form of anemia due to hemolysis, the abnormal breakdown of red blood cells (RBCs), either in the blood vessels (intravascular hemolysis) or elsewhere in the human body (extravascular). This most commonly occurs within the spleen, but also can occur in the reticuloendothelial system or mechanically (prosthetic valve damage). Hemolytic anemia accounts for 5% of all existing anemias. It has numerous possible consequences, ranging from general symptoms to life-threatening systemic effects. The general classification of hemolytic anemia is either intrinsic or extrinsic."
Endometrial Stromal Sarcoma,"Irregular vaginal bleeding, increased menstruation, vaginal discharge, anemia, lower abdominal pain","Endometrial cancer is a cancer that arises from the endometrium (the lining of the uterus or womb). It is the result of the abnormal growth of cells that can invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause."
Splenic Tumor,"Abdominal pain, chest tightness and shortness of breath","A splenic tumor is a rare form of tumor that may be malignant or benign. Malignant forms include lymphoma and sarcoma.
Lymphoma is the most common malignant splenic tumor."
Acute Cholangitis,"Chills, fever, abdominal pain, jaundice","Ascending cholangitis, also known as acute cholangitis or simply cholangitis, is inflammation of the bile duct, usually caused by bacteria ascending from its junction with the duodenum (first part of the small intestine). It tends to occur if the bile duct is already partially obstructed by gallstones.
Cholangitis can be life-threatening, and is regarded as a medical emergency. Characteristic symptoms include yellow discoloration of the skin or whites of the eyes, fever, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, low blood pressure and confusion. Initial treatment is with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but there is often an underlying problem (such as gallstones or narrowing in the bile duct) for which further tests and treatments may be necessary, usually in the form of endoscopy to relieve obstruction of the bile duct."
Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus,"Vulvar itching, vulvar skin is white or presents with fissures and ulceration; severe cases may lead to labial adhesion and disappearance, affecting sexual life.","Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease, of unknown cause, which can affect any body part of any person, but has a strong preference for the genitals (penis, vulva), and is also known as balanitis xerotica obliterans when it affects the penis. Lichen sclerosus is not contagious. There is a well-documented increase of skin cancer risk in LS, potentially improvable with treatment. LS in adult age women is normally incurable, although treatment can lessen its effects, and it often gets progressively worse if not treated properly. Most males with mild or intermediate disease, restricted to foreskin or glans, can be cured by either medical or surgical treatment."
Zygomatic Fracture,"History of trauma, localized pain, swelling","A zygoma fracture (zygomatic fracture) is a form of facial fracture caused by a fracture of the zygomatic bone. Symptoms include flattening of the face, trismus (reduced opening of the jaw) and lateral subconjunctival hemorrhage.


== Signs and symptoms ==
When zygoma fractures occur, the most typical symptoms are paresthesias in the upper lip, nose, cheek, and lower eyelid, diplopia, and pain. Particular physical characteristics that support zygomatic fracture include globe injury, impaired ocular motility, globe malposition, orbital emphysema, trismus, palpable stepoffs at the inferior or upper lateral edge of the orbit, reduced feeling throughout the infraorbital nerve's distribution, subconjunctival hemorrhage, periorbital ecchymoses, flattened malar eminence, and widened facial appearance.


== Causes ==
High-impact trauma is almost always the cause of zygoma fractures."
Breast Sarcoma,"Breast lump, breast swelling","A sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that arises from cells of mesenchymal origin. Originating from mesenchymal cells means that sarcomas are cancers of connective tissues such as bone, cartilage, muscle, fat, or vascular tissues. 
Sarcomas are one of five different types of cancer, classified by the cell type from which they originate. While there are five types under this category, sarcomas are most frequently contrasted with carcinomas which are much more common. Sarcomas are quite rare, making up about 1% of all adult cancer diagnoses and 15% of childhood cancer diagnoses."
Esophageal obstruction,"Difficulty swallowing, difficulty in passing food, immediate vomiting upon ingestion","An esophageal food bolus obstruction is a medical emergency caused by the obstruction of the esophagus by an ingested foreign body.
It is usually associated with diseases that may narrow the lumen of the esophagus, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, Schatzki rings, peptic strictures, webs, or cancers of the esophagus; rarely it can be seen in disorders of the movement of the esophagus, such as nutcracker esophagus.
While some esophageal food boli can pass by themselves or with the assistance of medications, some require the use of endoscopy to push the obstructing food into the stomach, or remove it from the esophagus. The use of glucagon, while common, has not been found to be useful.
Eponymous names include 'the steakhouse syndrome' and 'backyard barbeque syndrome'."
Tracheal Tumor,"Cough, ulcer, tumor cell infiltration, bloody sputum, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, pulmonary purulent infection, secondary infection, tracheal obstruction, esophagotracheal fistula","A tracheal tumor is a tumor primarily presenting in the trachea. It may be benign or malignant. 80% of all tracheal tumors are malignant. Among these, the most common are the squamous-cell carcinoma and the adenoid cystic carcinoma."
Horseshoe Kidney,"Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, difficulty in urinating","Horseshoe kidney, also known as ren arcuatus  (in Latin), renal fusion or super kidney, is a congenital disorder affecting about 1 in 500 people that is more common in men, often asymptomatic, and usually diagnosed incidentally. In this disorder, the patient's kidneys fuse to form a horseshoe-shape during development in the womb. The fused part is the isthmus of the horseshoe kidney. The abnormal anatomy can affect kidney drainage resulting in increased frequency of kidney stones and urinary tract infections as well as increase risk of certain renal cancers.
Fusion abnormalities of the kidney can be categorized into two groups: horseshoe kidney and crossed fused ectopia."
Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN),"Oliguria, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, polyuria, diarrhea, anemia, somnolence, coma, seizures, wasting, muscle atrophy","Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a medical condition involving the death of tubular epithelial cells that form the renal tubules of the kidneys. Because necrosis is often not present, the term acute tubular injury (ATI) is preferred by pathologists over the older name acute tubular necrosis (ATN). ATN presents with acute kidney injury (AKI) and is one of the most common causes of AKI. Common causes of ATN include low blood pressure and use of nephrotoxic drugs. The presence of ""muddy brown casts"" of epithelial cells found in the urine during urinalysis is pathognomonic for ATN. Management relies on aggressive treatment of the factors that precipitated ATN (e.g. hydration and cessation of the offending drug)."
Verrucous Hemangioma,"Unilateral grouped, scattered, or confluent keratotic vascular papules","Cavernous hemangioma, also called cavernous angioma, venous malformation, or cavernoma, is a type of venous malformation due to endothelial dysmorphogenesis from a lesion which is present at birth. A cavernoma in the brain is called a cerebral cavernous malformation or CCM.  Despite its designation as a hemangioma, a cavernous hemangioma is a benign (but not harmless) condition, not a malignant tumor, as it does not display endothelial hyperplasia. The abnormal tissue causes a slowing of blood flow through the cavities, or ""caverns"". The blood vessels do not form the necessary junctions with surrounding cells, and the structural support from the smooth muscle is hindered, causing leakage into the surrounding tissue. It is the leakage of blood (hemorrhage) that causes a variety of symptoms known to be associated with the condition."
Pseudomonas aeruginosa Infection,"Viscous secretions with a sweet and rotten smell on burn wounds, papules, lymph fluid exudation","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common encapsulated, Gram-negative, aerobicfacultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium that can cause disease in plants and animals, including humans. A species of considerable medical importance, P. aeruginosa is a multidrug resistant pathogen recognized for its ubiquity, its intrinsically advanced antibiotic resistance mechanisms, and its association with serious illnesses  hospital-acquired infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and various sepsis syndromes. P. aeruginosa is able to selectively inhibit various antibiotics from penetrating its outer membrane - and has high resistance to several antibiotics. According to the World Health Organization P. aeruginosa poses one of the greatest threats to humans in terms of antibiotic resistance.
The organism is considered opportunistic insofar as serious infection often occurs during existing diseases or conditions  most notably cystic fibrosis and traumatic burns."
AIDS-Related Lymphoma,"Fever, abdominal pain, emaciation, weight loss","AIDS-related lymphoma describes lymphomas occurring in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
A lymphoma is a type of cancer arising from lymphoid cells. In AIDS, the incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, primary cerebral lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease are all increased. There are three different varieties of AIDS-related lymphoma: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, B-cell immunoblastic lymphoma, and Burkitt's lymphoma (small non-cleaved cell lymphoma).


== Signs and symptoms ==
The histologic classification of the lymphoma, as well as the locations and severity of the disease, all influence the clinical presentation of HIV-related lymphomas."
Rh Incompatibility,"Jaundice, poor appetite, fever","Hemolytic disease of the newborn, also known as hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn, HDN, HDFN, or erythroblastosis fetalis, is an alloimmune condition that develops in a fetus at or around birth, when the IgG molecules (one of the five main types of antibodies) produced by the mother pass through the placenta. Among these antibodies are some which attack antigens on the red blood cells in the fetal circulation, breaking down and destroying the cells. The fetus can develop reticulocytosis and anemia. The intensity of this fetal disease ranges from mild to very severe, and fetal death from heart failure (hydrops fetalis) can occur. When the disease is moderate or severe, many erythroblasts (immature red blood cells) are present in the fetal blood, earning these forms of the disease the name erythroblastosis fetalis (British English: erythroblastosis foetalis
HDFN represents a breach of immune privilege for the fetus or some other form of impairment of the immune tolerance in pregnancy."
Sporadic Encephalitis,"Drowsiness, clouding of consciousness, drooling","CreutzfeldtJakob disease (CJD) is an incurable, always fatal neurodegenerative disease belonging to the transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) group. Early symptoms include memory problems, behavioral changes, poor coordination, and visual and/or auditory disturbances. Later symptoms include dementia, involuntary movements, blindness and/or deafness, weakness, and coma. About 70% of people die within a year of diagnosis. The name ""CreutzfeldtJakob disease"" was introduced by Walther Spielmeyer in 1922, after the German neurologists Hans Gerhard Creutzfeldt and Alfons Maria Jakob."
Splenectomy,"Abdominal pain, shock, abdominal muscle tension","A splenectomy is the surgical procedure that partially or completely removes the spleen. The spleen is an important organ in regard to immunological function due to its ability to efficiently destroy encapsulated bacteria. Therefore, removal of the spleen runs the risk of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection, a medical emergency and rapidly fatal disease caused by the inability of the body's immune system to properly fight infection following splenectomy or asplenia.
Common indications for splenectomy include trauma, tumors, splenomegaly or for hematological disease such as sickle cell anemia or thalassemia.


== Indications ==
The spleen is an organ located in the abdomen next to the stomach."
Main Pulmonary Artery Septal Defect,"Cyanosis of lips, difficulty breathing, chest discomfort, cough","Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect is a rare birth defect characterized by pulmonary valve atresia occurring alongside a defect on the right ventricular outflow tract.
It is a type of congenital heart disease/defect, and one of the two recognized subtypes of pulmonary atresia, the other being pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum.


== Signs and symptoms ==

The condition consists of atresia affecting the pulmonary valve and a hypoplastic right ventricular outflow tract. The ventricular septal defect doesn't impede the in and outflowing of blood in the ventricular septum, which helps it form during fetal life.
The spectrum of symptoms exhibited by children with this condition depends on the severity of the condition, while some barely show symptoms, others might develop complications such as congestive heart failure."
Renal Vein Thrombosis,"High fever with chills, abdominal pain, sudden severe back pain, tenderness and percussion pain in the kidney area, hematuria, intercostal tenderness, persistent proteinuria, and swelling of the lower limbs","Renal vein thrombosis (RVT) is the formation of a clot in the vein that drains blood from the kidneys, ultimately leading to a reduction in the drainage of one or both kidneys and the possible migration of the clot to other parts of the body. First described by German pathologist Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen in 1861, RVT most commonly affects two subpopulations: newly born infants with blood clotting abnormalities or dehydration and adults with nephrotic syndrome.
Nephrotic syndrome, a kidney disorder, causes excessive loss of protein in the urine, low levels of albumin in the blood, a high level of cholesterol in the blood and swelling, triggering a hypercoagulable state and increasing chances of clot formation. Other less common causes include hypercoagulable state, cancer, kidney transplantation, Behcet syndrome, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome or blunt trauma to the back or abdomen.
Treatment of RVT mainly focuses on preventing further blood clots in the kidneys and maintaining stable kidney function."
Biliary Chronic Pancreatitis,"Abdominal pain, indigestion, polydipsia, weight loss, pancreatic fibrosis, persistent pain, loss of appetite, anorexia, nausea, weight reduction, signs of peritoneal irritation, and tenderness in the upper abdomen","Chronic pancreatitis is a long-standing inflammation of the pancreas that alters the organ's normal structure and functions. It can present as episodes of acute inflammation in a previously injured pancreas, or as chronic damage with persistent pain or malabsorption. It is a disease process characterized by irreversible damage to the pancreas as distinct from reversible changes in acute pancreatitis. Tobacco smoke and alcohol misuse are two of the most frequently implicated causes, and the two risk factors are thought to have a synergistic effect with regards to the development of chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is a risk factor for the development of pancreatic cancer."
Wegener's Granulomatosis,"Fever, weight loss, fatigue, joint pain, myalgia, purpura, hemorrhagic vesicles, nodules, cough, and hemoptysis","Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), after Nazi German physician Friedrich Wegener, is a rare, long-term, systemic disorder that involves the formation of granulomas and inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis). It is an autoimmune disease and a form of vasculitis that affects small- and medium-sized vessels in many organs, but most commonly affects the upper respiratory tract, lungs, and kidneys. The signs and symptoms of GPA are highly varied and reflect which organs are supplied by the affected blood vessels. Typical signs and symptoms include nosebleeds, stuffy nose and crustiness of nasal secretions, and inflammation of the uveal layer of the eye.  Damage to the heart, lungs, and kidneys can be fatal."
Sudden Cardiac Death-Type Coronary Artery Disease,"Chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, arrhythmia, angina pectoris, cessation of bleeding during surgery, heart failure, cardiac arrest, abnormal respiration, cardiogenic sudden death, cardiogenic chest pain","Coronary artery disease (CAD), also called coronary heart disease (CHD), or ischemic heart disease (IHD), is a type of heart disease involving the reduction of blood flow to the cardiac muscle due to a build-up of atheromatous plaque in the arteries of the heart. It is the most common of the cardiovascular diseases. CAD can cause stable angina, unstable angina, myocardial ischemia, and myocardial infarction.
A common symptom is angina, which is chest pain or discomfort that may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Occasionally it may feel like heartburn."
Renal Injury,"Urinary extravasation, elevated hematocrit, hematuria, low back pain, renal abscess, hypertension","Kidney failure, also known as renal failure or end-stage renal disease (ESRD), is a medical condition in which the kidneys can no longer adequately filter waste products from the blood, functioning at less than 15% of normal levels. Kidney failure is classified as either acute kidney failure, which develops rapidly and may resolve; and chronic kidney failure, which develops slowly and can often be irreversible. Symptoms may include leg swelling, feeling tired, vomiting, loss of appetite, and confusion. Complications of acute and chronic failure include uremia, hyperkalemia, and volume overload. Complications of chronic failure also include heart disease, high blood pressure, and anaemia."
Adolescent Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding,"Menstrual irregularity, extended menstrual periods, pale complexion","Abnormal uterine bleeding is vaginal bleeding from the uterus that is abnormally frequent, lasts excessively long, is heavier than normal, or is irregular. The term ""dysfunctional uterine bleeding"" was used when no underlying cause was present. Quality of life may be negatively affected.
The underlying causes may be structural or non-structural and are classified in accordance with the FIGO system 1 & 2. Common causes include: Ovulation problems, fibroids, the lining of the uterus growing into the uterine wall, uterine polyps, underlying bleeding problems, side effects from birth control, or cancer."
Urethral Diverticulum,"Local swelling of the urethra, urethral orifice mass","A urethral diverticulum is a condition where the urethra or the periurethral glands push into the connective tissue layers (fascia) that surround it.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Urethral diverticula are often asymptomatic and symptoms that are present tend to be nonspecific. They can co-occur with cancer, in approximately 6-9% of cases, most commonly adenocarcinoma, but also including squamous cell carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma. Approximately 10% of cases co-occur with kidney stones.
There are 2 types of urethral diverticulums."
Hyperparathyroidism-related Cardiomyopathy,"Osteoporosis, thyrotoxic crisis, joint pain, hypertension, electrophysiological abnormalities, pathological Q waves, heart failure, hypercalcemia, cardiogenic syncope, peripartum cardiomyopathy, hyperparathyroidism, vomiting","Complications of diabetes are secondary diseases that are a result of elevated blood glucose levels that occur in diabetic patients. These complications can be divided into two types: acute and chronic. Acute complications are complications that develop rapidly and can be exemplified as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state (HHS), lactic acidosis (LA), and hypoglycemia. Chronic complications develop over time and are generally classified in two categories: microvascular and macrovascular. Microvascular complications include neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy; while cardiovascular disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease are included in the macrovascular complications."
Hypogammaglobulinemia,"Immunodeficiency, prone to catching colds, fever","Hypogammaglobulinemia is an immune system disorder in which not enough gamma globulins are produced in the blood (thus hypo- + gamma + globulin + -emia). This results in a lower antibody count, which impairs the immune system, increasing risk of infection. Hypogammaglobulinemia may result from a variety of primary genetic immune system defects, such as common variable immunodeficiency, or it may be caused by secondary effects such as medication, blood cancer, or poor nutrition, or loss of gamma globulins in urine, as in nonselective glomerular proteinuria.  Patients with hypogammaglobulinemia have reduced immune function; important considerations include avoiding use of live vaccines, and take precautionary measures when traveling to regions with endemic disease or poor sanitation such as receiving immunizations, taking antibiotics abroad, drinking only safe or boiled water, arranging appropriate medical cover in advance of travel, and ensuring continuation of any immunoglobulin infusions needed.


== Types ==
The following lists types of ""agammaglobulinemia"" catalogued in the OMIM. Hypogammaglobulinemia can have other types; see sections ""Causes"" and ""Etymology"" below."
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID),"Increased vaginal discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, pain during sexual intercourse","Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), also known as pelvic inflammatory disorder, is an infection of the upper part of the female reproductive system, mainly the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often, there may be no symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present, may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, bleeding after sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long-term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.
The disease is caused by bacteria that spread from the vagina and cervix."
Spinal Muscular Atrophy in Children,"Progressive, symmetric, predominantly proximal limb, widespread flaccid paralysis and muscle atrophy","Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a rare neuromuscular disorder that results in the loss of motor neurons and progressive muscle wasting. It is usually diagnosed in infancy or early childhood and if left untreated it is the most common genetic cause of infant death. It may also appear later in life and then have a milder course of the disease. The common feature is the progressive weakness of voluntary muscles, with the arm, leg, and respiratory muscles being affected first. Associated problems may include poor head control, difficulties swallowing, scoliosis, and joint contractures."
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL),"Wasting, anemia, fatigue, weight loss, recurrent infections, tendency to bleed, superficial lymph node enlargement","Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. In CLL, the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell. In patients with CLL, B cell lymphocytes can begin to collect in their blood, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. These cells do not function well and crowd out healthy blood cells. CLL is divided into two main types:

Slow-growing CLL (indolent CLL)
Fast-growing CLL
Many people do not have any symptoms when they are first diagnosed."

To meet criteria for CKD, the abnormalities must be present for at least three months. Early in the course of CKD, patients are usually asymptomatic, but later symptoms may include leg swelling, feeling tired, vomiting, loss of appetite, and confusion. Complications can relate to hormonal dysfunction of the kidneys and include (in chronological order) high blood pressure (often related to activation of the reninangiotensin system), bone disease, and anemia. Additionally CKD patients have markedly increased cardiovascular complications with increased risks of death and hospitalization."
Senile Keratosis,"Papules, slow growth, dry skin, pain, high blood pressure, neurodermatitis, vulvar pruritus, hypothyroidism","Actinic keratosis (AK), sometimes called solar keratosis or senile keratosis, is a pre-cancerous area of thick, scaly, or crusty skin. Actinic keratosis is a disorder (-osis) of epidermal keratinocytes that is induced by ultraviolet (UV) light exposure (actin-). 
These growths are more common in fair-skinned people and those who are frequently in the sun. They are believed to form when skin gets damaged by UV radiation from the sun or indoor tanning beds, usually over the course of decades. Given their pre-cancerous nature, if left untreated, they may turn into a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma."
Pediatric Chronic Pneumonia,"Wheezing, cyanosis, dyspnea, clubbing of fingers (toes), facial edema, thoracic deformity in children, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and increased white blood cells (WBC)","Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) refers to pneumonia (any of several lung diseases) contracted by a person outside of the healthcare system. In contrast, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is seen in patients who have recently visited a hospital or who live in long-term care facilities. CAP is common, affecting people of all ages, and its symptoms occur as a result of oxygen-absorbing areas of the lung (alveoli) filling with fluid. This inhibits lung function, causing dyspnea, fever, chest pains and cough.
CAP, the most common type of pneumonia, is a leading cause of illness and death worldwide."
Acute Respiratory Failure,"Dyspnea, cyanosis, restlessness, dizziness, coma, jaundice, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, edema, arrhythmia","Respiratory failure results from inadequate gas exchange by the respiratory system, meaning that the arterial oxygen, carbon dioxide, or both cannot be kept at normal levels. A drop in the oxygen carried in the blood is known as hypoxemia; a rise in arterial carbon dioxide levels is called hypercapnia. Respiratory failure is classified as either Type 1 or Type 2, based on whether there is a high carbon dioxide level, and can be acute or chronic. In clinical trials, the definition of respiratory failure usually includes increased respiratory rate, abnormal blood gases (hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or both), and evidence of increased work of breathing. Respiratory failure causes an altered state of consciousness due to ischemia in the brain."
Iron Poisoning,"Abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, shock, hematemesis and melena, headache, hematochezia, melena, stupor, restlessness, vomiting blood","Iron poisoning typically occurs from ingestion of excess iron that results in acute toxicity. Mild symptoms which occur within hours include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and drowsiness. In more severe cases, symptoms can include tachypnea, low blood pressure, seizures, or coma. If left untreated, acute iron poisoning can lead to multi-organ failure resulting in permanent organ damage or death.
Iron is available over the counter as a single entity supplement in an iron salt form or in combination with vitamin supplements and is commonly used in the treatment of anemias."
High Output Circulation,"Palpitations, fatigue, chest tightness, dizziness, precordial pain, low-grade fever, hyperhidrosis, insomnia, limb numbness, subjective shortness of breath, pharyngeal obstruction, nausea, vomiting","In cardiac physiology, cardiac output (CO), also known as heart output and often denoted by the symbols

, is the volumetric flow rate of the heart's pumping output: that is, the volume of blood being pumped by a single ventricle of the heart, per unit time (usually measured per minute). Cardiac output (CO) is the product of the heart rate (HR), i.e. the number of heartbeats per minute (bpm), and the stroke volume (SV), which is the volume of blood pumped from the left ventricle per beat; thus giving the formula:

    {\displaystyle CO=HR\times SV}
  

Values for cardiac output are usually denoted as L/min. For a healthy individual weighing 70 kg, the cardiac output at rest averages about 5 L/min; assuming a heart rate of 70 beats/min, the stroke volume would be approximately 70 mL.
Because cardiac output is related to the quantity of blood delivered to various parts of the body, it is an important component of how efficiently the heart can meet the body's demands for the maintenance of adequate tissue perfusion. Body tissues require continuous oxygen delivery which requires the sustained transport of oxygen to the tissues by systemic circulation of oxygenated blood at an adequate pressure from the left ventricle of the heart via the aorta and arteries."
Localized Osteomyelitis,"Abscess, skin erythema, necrosis, osteosclerosis, bone pain","Osteomyelitis of the jaws is osteomyelitis (which is infection and inflammation of the bone marrow, sometimes abbreviated to OM) which occurs in the bones of the jaws (i.e. maxilla or the mandible). Historically, osteomyelitis of the jaws was a common complication of odontogenic infection (infections of the teeth). Before the antibiotic era, it was frequently a fatal condition.
Former and colloquial names include Osteonecrosis of the jaws (ONJ), cavitations, dry or wet socket, and NICO (Neuralgia-Inducing Cavitational osteonecrosis)."
Vascular Dementia,"Neurasthenia syndrome, restlessness, insomnia, cognitive decline, vascular dementia, dementia, psychiatric disorders, anxiety, emotional incontinence, irritability, generalized headache, headache","Vascular dementia is dementia caused by a series of strokes. Restricted blood flow due to strokes reduces oxygen and glucose delivery to the brain, causing cell injury and neurological deficits in the affected region. Subtypes of vascular dementia include subcortical vascular dementia, multi-infarct dementia, stroke-related dementia, and mixed dementia.
Subcortical vascular dementia occurs from damage to small blood vessels in the brain. Multi-infarct dementia results from a series of small strokes affecting several brain regions."
Biliary Peritonitis,"Abdominal pain, lower abdominal mass, fever, oliguria, peritonitis, discomfort in the abdomen, abdominal pain accompanied by shock","Peritonitis is inflammation of the localized or generalized peritoneum, the lining of the inner wall of the abdomen and covering of the abdominal organs. Symptoms may include severe pain, swelling of the abdomen, fever, or weight loss. One part or the entire abdomen may be tender. Complications may include shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Causes include perforation of the intestinal tract, pancreatitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, stomach ulcer, cirrhosis, a ruptured appendix or even a perforated gallbladder."
Retroperitoneal Hemorrhage,"Peritoneal irritation signs, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, disappearance of the psoas shadow","Retroperitoneal bleeding is an accumulation of blood in the retroperitoneal space. Signs and symptoms may include abdominal or upper leg pain, hematuria, and shock. It can be caused by major trauma or by non-traumatic mechanisms.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Signs and symptoms may include:

abdominal pain.
upper leg pain."
Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"Fatigue, weight loss, hidden pain in the upper right abdomen, and significant loss of appetite","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer in adults and is currently the most common cause of death in people with cirrhosis. HCC is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.
HCC most commonly occurs in those with chronic liver disease especially those with cirrhosis or fibrosis, which occur in the setting of chronic liver injury and inflammation. HCC is rare in those without chronic liver disease. Chronic liver diseases which greatly increase the risk of HCC include hepatitis infection such as (hepatitis B, C or D), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), alcoholic liver disease, or exposure to toxins such as aflatoxin, or pyrrolizidine alkaloids.:870873 Certain diseases, such as hemochromatosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, markedly increase the risk of developing HCC. The five-year survival in those with HCC is 18%."
Epidemic Typhus,"Fever, maculopapular rash, headache, delirium, arrhythmias, coma, cough, nausea and vomiting, chest pain, persistent high fever, fatigue, dizziness","Epidemic typhus, also known as louse-borne typhus, is a form of typhus so named because the disease often causes epidemics following wars and natural disasters where civil life is disrupted. Epidemic typhus is spread to people through contact with infected body lice, in contrast to endemic typhus which is usually transmitted by fleas.
Though typhus has been responsible for millions of deaths throughout history, it is still considered a rare disease that occurs mainly in populations that suffer unhygienic extreme overcrowding. Typhus is most rare in industrialized countries. It occurs primarily in the colder, mountainous regions of central and east Africa, as well as Central and South America."
Peritoneal Mesothelioma,"Cachexia, anemia, constipation, abdominal mass, fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, ascites, abdominal distension","Peritoneal mesothelioma is the name given to the cancer that attacks the lining of the abdomen. This type of cancer affects the lining that protects the contents of the abdomen and provides a lubricating fluid to enable the organs to move and work properly.
The peritoneum is made of two parts, the visceral and parietal peritoneum. The visceral peritoneum covers the internal organs and makes up most of the outer layer of the intestinal tract. Covering the abdominal cavity is the parietal peritoneum."
Iatrogenic tracheal and main bronchus injury,"Cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea","Tracheobronchial injury is damage to the tracheobronchial tree (the airway structure involving the trachea and bronchi). It can result from blunt or penetrating trauma to the neck or chest, inhalation of harmful fumes or smoke, or aspiration of liquids or objects.
Though rare, TBI is a serious condition; it may cause obstruction of the airway with resulting life-threatening respiratory insufficiency. Other injuries accompany TBI in about half of cases. Of those people with TBI who die, most do so before receiving emergency care, either from airway obstruction, exsanguination, or from injuries to other vital organs."
Sick Sinus Syndrome,"Slowed heart rate, irregular heartbeat","Sinus node dysfunction (SND), also known as sick sinus syndrome (SSS), is a group of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) usually caused by a malfunction of the sinus node, the heart's primary pacemaker. Tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome is a variant of sick sinus syndrome in which the arrhythmia alternates between fast and slow heart rates.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Often sinus node dysfunction produces no symptoms, especially early in the disease course. Signs and symptoms usually appear in more advanced disease and more than 50% of patients will present with syncope or transient near-fainting spells as well as bradycardias that are accompanied by rapid heart rhythms, referred to as tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome Other presenting signs or symptoms can include confusion, fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea. Patients can also present with symptoms of congestive heart failure, stroke or transient ischemic attacks due to the abnormal rhythm."
Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head,"Bone pain, joint dysfunction, swelling of the lesion site","Avascular necrosis (AVN), also called osteonecrosis or bone infarction, is death of bone tissue due to interruption of the blood supply. Early on, there may be no symptoms. Gradually joint pain may develop, which may limit the person's ability to move. Complications may include collapse of the bone or nearby joint surface.
Risk factors include bone fractures, joint dislocations, alcoholism, and the use of high-dose steroids."
Menorrhagia,"Significant increase in menstrual flow, regular menstrual cycle","Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), previously known as menorrhagia or hematomunia, is a menstrual period with excessively heavy flow. It is a type of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB).
Abnormal uterine bleeding can be caused by structural abnormalities in the reproductive tract, skipping ovulation (anovulation), bleeding disorders, hormonal issues (such as hypothyroidism) or cancer of the reproductive tract.
Initial evaluation during diagnosis aims at determining pregnancy status, menopausal status, and the source of bleeding. One definition for diagnosing the condition is bleeding lasting more than 7 days or the loss of more than 80 mL of blood heavy flow."
Thoracic Aortic Dissection Aneurysm,"Paraplegia, shock, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, chest pain, severe pain, back pain, radiating pain, persistent pain, paleness of the skin, abnormal sweating, cyanosis","A thoracic aortic aneurysm is an aortic aneurysm that presents primarily in the thorax.
A thoracic aortic aneurysm is the ""ballooning"" of the upper aspect of the aorta, above the diaphragm. Untreated or unrecognized they can be fatal due to dissection or ""popping"" of the aneurysm leading to nearly instant death. Thoracic aneurysms are less common than an abdominal aortic aneurysm. However, a syphilitic aneurysm is more likely to be a thoracic aortic aneurysm than an abdominal aortic aneurysm."
Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR),"Preeclampsia, weight loss, malnutrition, delayed fetal growth and development","Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), or fetal growth restriction, is the poor growth of a fetus while in the womb during pregnancy. IUGR is defined by clinical features of malnutrition and evidence of reduced growth regardless of an infant's birth weight percentile. The causes of IUGR are broad and may involve maternal, fetal, or placental complications.
At least 60% of the 4 million neonatal deaths that occur worldwide every year are associated with low birth weight, caused by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm delivery, and genetic abnormalities, demonstrating that under-nutrition is already a leading health problem at birth.
Intrauterine growth restriction can result in a baby being small for gestational age (SGA), which is most commonly defined as a weight below the 10th percentile for the gestational age."
Esophageal Sarcoma,"Sensation of a foreign body in the throat, difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, substernal burning pain","An osteosarcoma (OS) or osteogenic sarcoma (OGS) is a cancerous tumor in a bone. Specifically, it is an aggressive malignant neoplasm that arises from primitive transformed cells of mesenchymal origin (and thus a sarcoma) and that exhibits osteoblastic differentiation and produces malignant osteoid.
Osteosarcoma is the most common histological form of primary bone sarcoma. It is most prevalent in teenagers and young adults.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Many patients first complain of pain that may be worse at night, may be intermittent and of varying intensity and may have been occurring for a long time."
Nephroblastoma (Wilms Tumor),"Abdominal pain and backache, abdominal mass, abdominal distention, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, weight loss, restlessness, low-grade fever, weight reduction, varicocele, hypertension, hematuria","Wilms' tumor or Wilms tumor, also known as nephroblastoma, is a cancer of the kidneys that typically occurs in children (rarely in adults), and occurs most commonly as a renal tumor in child patients. It is named after Max Wilms, the German surgeon (18671918) who first described it.
Approximately 650 cases are diagnosed in the U.S. annually. The majority of cases occur in children with no associated genetic syndromes; however, a minority of children with Wilms' tumor have a congenital abnormality.  It is highly responsive to treatment, with about 90 percent of children being cured."
Pulmonary Failure,"Wheezing with shoulder elevation, cyanosis of lips, cold limbs, and productive cough with thick sputum","Respiratory failure results from inadequate gas exchange by the respiratory system, meaning that the arterial oxygen, carbon dioxide, or both cannot be kept at normal levels. A drop in the oxygen carried in the blood is known as hypoxemia; a rise in arterial carbon dioxide levels is called hypercapnia. Respiratory failure is classified as either Type 1 or Type 2, based on whether there is a high carbon dioxide level, and can be acute or chronic. In clinical trials, the definition of respiratory failure usually includes increased respiratory rate, abnormal blood gases (hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or both), and evidence of increased work of breathing. Respiratory failure causes an altered state of consciousness due to ischemia in the brain."
Orbital Cavernous Hemangioma,"Vascular malformations, exophthalmos, eyelid swelling and presenting a pale green color","Cavernous hemangioma, also called cavernous angioma, venous malformation, or cavernoma, is a type of venous malformation due to endothelial dysmorphogenesis from a lesion which is present at birth. A cavernoma in the brain is called a cerebral cavernous malformation or CCM.  Despite its designation as a hemangioma, a cavernous hemangioma is a benign (but not harmless) condition, not a malignant tumor, as it does not display endothelial hyperplasia. The abnormal tissue causes a slowing of blood flow through the cavities, or ""caverns"". The blood vessels do not form the necessary junctions with surrounding cells, and the structural support from the smooth muscle is hindered, causing leakage into the surrounding tissue. It is the leakage of blood (hemorrhage) that causes a variety of symptoms known to be associated with the condition."
Bromism,"Patients with bromism exhibit symptoms that include a bromide or salty taste in the mouth, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhea, rectal bleeding, restlessness, fatigue, insomnia or hypersomnia, headache, dizziness, impaired consciousness, and orientation. Emotional disturbances, agitation with severe cases experiencing mania, delirium, hallucinations, and coma may follow.","Bromism is the syndrome which results from the long-term consumption of bromine, usually through bromine-based sedatives such as potassium bromide and lithium bromide. Bromism was once a very common disorder, being responsible for 5 to 10% of psychiatric hospital admissions, but is now uncommon since bromide was withdrawn from clinical use in many countries and was severely restricted in others.


== Presentation ==


=== Neurological and psychiatric ===
Neurological and psychiatric symptoms are widely variable. Common symptoms may include restlessness, irritability, ataxia, confusion, hallucinations, psychosis, weakness, stupor, and, in severe cases, coma.


=== Gastrointestinal ===
Gastrointestinal effects include nausea and vomiting as acute adverse effects."
Cervical Conization,"Vaginal bleeding, Postcoital bleeding","Cervical conization refers to an excision of a cone-shaped portion of tissue from the mucous membrane of the cervix. Conization is used for diagnostic purposes as part of a biopsy and for therapeutic purposes to remove pre-cancerous cells (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) or early stage cervical cancer. Ablative treatments are also available to treat abnormal cervical cells. The decision to perform a cervical conization procedure is made with consideration of a patient's pap smear, colposcopy, and HPV test results. ACOG recommends that decisions regarding excision should be based on risk of CIN3+."
Postpericardiotomy Syndrome,"Postoperative fever, fatigue, chest pain, pericardial effusion, and fever","Postpericardiotomy syndrome (PPS) is an immune phenomenon that occurs days to months (usually 16 weeks) after surgical incision of the pericardium (membranes encapsulating the human heart). PPS can also be caused after a trauma, a puncture of the cardiac or pleural structures (such as a bullet or stab wound), after percutaneous coronary intervention (such as stent placement after a myocardial infarction or heart attack), or due to pacemaker or pacemaker wire placement.


== Signs and symptoms ==
The typical signs of post-pericardiotomy syndrome include fever, pleuritis (with possible pleural effusion),  pericarditis (with possible pericardial effusion), occasional but rare pulmonary infiltrates, and fatigue. Cough, pleuritic or retrosternal chest pain, joint pain and decreased oxygen saturation can also be seen in some cases.
Other signs include arthritis, together with petechiae on the skin and palate.:827


=== Complications ===
Complications include pericarditis, pericardial effusion, pleuritis, pulmonary infiltration, and very rarely pericardial tamponade."
Congenital Anterior Urethral Valve,Difficulty in urination and urinary retention,"Posterior urethral valve (PUV) disorder is an obstructive developmental anomaly in the urethra and genitourinary system of male newborns. A posterior urethral valve is an obstructing membrane in the posterior male urethra as a result of abnormal in utero development. It is the most common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in male newborns. The disorder varies in degree, with mild cases presenting late due to milder symptoms. More severe cases can have renal and respiratory failure from lung underdevelopment as result of low amniotic fluid volumes, requiring intensive care and close monitoring."
Endocrine Disorder,"Breast pain, Endometriosis, Menstrual disorders, Premature aging, Malnutrition, Dysmenorrhea, Female infertility","Endocrine diseases are disorders of the endocrine system. The branch of medicine associated with endocrine disorders is known as endocrinology.


== Types of disease ==
Broadly speaking, endocrine disorders may be subdivided into three groups:

Endocrine gland hypofunction/hyposecretion (leading to hormone deficiency)
Endocrine gland hyperfunction/hypersecretion (leading to hormone excess)
Tumours (benign or malignant) of endocrine glands
Endocrine disorders are often quite complex, involving a mixed picture of hyposecretion and hypersecretion because of the feedback mechanisms involved in the endocrine system. For example, most forms of hyperthyroidism are associated with an excess of thyroid hormone and a low level of thyroid stimulating hormone.

Pediatric Viral Pneumonia,"Persistent high fever, dyspnea, cyanosis, paroxysmal cough, and scanty hemoptysis sputum","Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) refers to pneumonia (any of several lung diseases) contracted by a person outside of the healthcare system. In contrast, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is seen in patients who have recently visited a hospital or who live in long-term care facilities. CAP is common, affecting people of all ages, and its symptoms occur as a result of oxygen-absorbing areas of the lung (alveoli) filling with fluid. This inhibits lung function, causing dyspnea, fever, chest pains and cough.
CAP, the most common type of pneumonia, is a leading cause of illness and death worldwide."
Lymphocytic Choroid Plexus Meningitis,"High fever, headache, generalized body ache, back pain, fever, diarrhea, cough, nausea and vomiting, irregular breathing, abdominal pain, chills","Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) is a rodent-borne viral infectious disease that presents as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis or meningoencephalitis. Its causative agent is lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a member of the family Arenaviridae. The name was coined by Charles Armstrong in 1934.
Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) is ""a viral infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord and of the cerebrospinal fluid"". The name is based on the tendency of an individual to have abnormally high levels of lymphocytes during infection."
Functional Uterine Bleeding,"Irregular uterine bleeding, varying amounts of blood or sudden increase, heavy bleeding, which can last for several months continuously, or prolonged menstrual periods, increased menstrual flow","Abnormal uterine bleeding is vaginal bleeding from the uterus that is abnormally frequent, lasts excessively long, is heavier than normal, or is irregular. The term ""dysfunctional uterine bleeding"" was used when no underlying cause was present. Quality of life may be negatively affected.
The underlying causes may be structural or non-structural and are classified in accordance with the FIGO system 1 & 2. Common causes include: Ovulation problems, fibroids, the lining of the uterus growing into the uterine wall, uterine polyps, underlying bleeding problems, side effects from birth control, or cancer."
Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Mass,"Abdominal pain, fever, increased vaginal discharge","Pelvic abscess is a collection of pus in the pelvis, typically occurring following lower abdominal surgical procedures, or as a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), appendicitis, or lower genital tract infections. Signs and symptoms include a high fever, pelvic mass, vaginal bleeding or discharge, and lower abdominal pain. It can lead to sepsis and death.
Blood tests typically show a raised white cell count. Other tests generally include urine pregnancy test, blood and exudate culture, and vaginal wet mount."
Chronic Subdural Hematoma,"Varying degrees of head injury history, hemiparesis, and aphasia commonly developing several months after injury","A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a type of bleeding in which a collection of bloodusually but not always associated with a traumatic brain injurygathers between the inner layer of the dura mater and the arachnoid mater of the meninges surrounding the brain. It usually results from rips in bridging veins that cross the subdural space.
Subdural hematomas may cause an increase in the pressure inside the skull, which in turn can cause compression of and damage to delicate brain tissue. Acute subdural hematomas are often life-threatening. Chronic subdural hematomas have a better prognosis if properly managed."
Angina Pectoris,"Pain, chest tightness, hidden chest pain, squeezing-like colic pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, pale complexion, and cold sweat","Angina, also known as angina pectoris, is chest pain or pressure, usually caused by insufficient blood flow to the heart muscle (myocardium). It is most commonly a symptom of coronary artery disease.
Angina is typically the result of partial obstruction or spasm of the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. The main mechanism of coronary artery obstruction is atherosclerosis as part of coronary artery disease. Other causes of angina include abnormal heart rhythms, heart failure and, less commonly, anemia."
Diffuse Malignant Mesothelioma,"Fever, pleural effusion, chest wall collapse, chest pain, abnormal breathing, cough","Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium). The area most commonly affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding each testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly."
Iris Neovascularization,Eye congestion,"Neovascularization of the iris (NVI), known as rubeosis iridis, is defined as blood vessel proliferation along the surface of the iris. There are many causes of NVI, including most commonly diabetic retinopathy (DR) and central retinal venous occlusion (CRVO). Untreated, it can result in neovascular glaucoma, which is often difficult to treat and vision threatening."
Neurofibromatosis,"Presents with intellectual decline, memory disorders, epileptic seizures, limb weakness, numbness, and skin pigmentation spots, which appear light brown, dark brown, or coffee-colored","Neurofibromatosis (NF) refers to a group of three distinct genetic conditions in which tumors grow in the nervous system. The tumors are non-cancerous (benign) and often involve the skin or surrounding bone. Although symptoms are often mild, each condition presents differently. Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is typically characterized by caf au lait spots (light-brown flat patches of skin), neurofibromas (small bumps in or under the skin), scoliosis (side-way curvature of the back), and headaches. Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2), on the other hand, may present with early-onset hearing loss, cataracts, tinnitus, difficulty walking or maintaining balance, and muscle atrophy."
Stylohyoid Syndrome,"Unilateral pharyngeal pain, foreign body sensation, exacerbated by swallowing or head movements, earache, headache, and a cord-like hard object in the tonsillar fossa","Eagle syndrome (also termed stylohyoid syndrome, styloid syndrome, stylalgia, styloid-stylohyoid syndrome, or styloidcarotid artery syndrome) is an uncommon condition commonly characterized but not limited to sudden, sharp nerve-like pain in the jaw bone and joint, back of the throat, and base of the tongue, triggered by swallowing, moving the jaw, or turning the neck. First described by American otorhinolaryngologist Watt Weems Eagle in 1937, the condition is caused by an elongated or misshapen styloid process (the slender, pointed piece of bone just below the ear) and/or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament, either of which interferes with the functioning of neighboring regions in the body, such as the glossopharyngeal nerve.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Possible symptoms include:

Classic Eagle syndrome is present on only one side; however, it may rarely be present on both sides.
In vascular Eagle syndrome, the elongated styloid process comes in contact with the internal carotid artery below the skull. In these cases, turning the head can cause compression of the artery or a tear inside the blood vessel, which restricts blood flow and can potentially lead to a transient ischemic attack or stroke."
Neonatal Sepsis,"Lethargy, Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Fever, Jaundice, Hepatosplenomegaly, Hypotension, Metabolic Acidosis, Abdominal Distension, Vomiting, Diarrhea, Petechiae, Purpura","Neonatal sepsis is a type of neonatal infection and specifically refers to the presence in a newborn baby of a bacterial blood stream infection (BSI) (such as meningitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, or gastroenteritis) in the setting of fever. Older textbooks may refer to neonatal sepsis as ""sepsis neonatorum"". Criteria with regards to hemodynamic compromise or respiratory failure are not useful clinically because these symptoms often do not arise in neonates until death is imminent and unpreventable. Neonatal sepsis is divided into two categories: early-onset sepsis (EOS) and late-onset sepsis (LOS). EOS refers to sepsis presenting in the first 7 days of life (although some refer to EOS as within the first 72 hours of life), with LOS referring to presentation of sepsis after 7 days (or 72 hours, depending on the system used)."
Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus,"Vulvar itching, vulvar skin is white or presents with fissures and ulceration; severe cases may lead to labial adhesion and disappearance, affecting sexual life.","Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease, of unknown cause, which can affect any body part of any person, but has a strong preference for the genitals (penis, vulva), and is also known as balanitis xerotica obliterans when it affects the penis. Lichen sclerosus is not contagious. There is a well-documented increase of skin cancer risk in LS, potentially improvable with treatment. LS in adult age women is normally incurable, although treatment can lessen its effects, and it often gets progressively worse if not treated properly. Most males with mild or intermediate disease, restricted to foreskin or glans, can be cured by either medical or surgical treatment."
Noise-Induced Hearing Loss,"Decreased hearing, tinnitus, earache, headache, dizziness","Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a hearing impairment resulting from exposure to loud sound. People may have a loss of perception of a narrow range of frequencies or impaired perception of sound including sensitivity to sound or ringing in the ears. When exposure to hazards such as noise occur at work and is associated with hearing loss, it is referred to as occupational hearing loss.
Hearing may deteriorate gradually from chronic and repeated noise exposure (such as to loud music or background noise) or suddenly from exposure to impulse noise, which is a short high intensity noise (such as a gunshot or airhorn). In both types, loud sound overstimulates delicate hearing cells, leading to the permanent injury or death of the cells."
Thoracic Trauma,"Swelling, pain, friction rubs, fracture","A chest injury, also known as chest trauma, is any form of physical injury to the chest including the ribs, heart and lungs. Chest injuries account for 25% of all deaths from traumatic injury. Typically chest injuries are caused by blunt mechanisms such as direct, indirect, compression, contusion, deceleration, or blasts caused by motor vehicle collisions or penetrating mechanisms such as stabbings.


== Classification ==
Chest injuries can be classified as blunt or penetrating. Blunt and penetrating injuries have different pathophysiologies and clinical courses."
Obstetric Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation,"Uterine bleeding, persistent bleeding, severe cases with skin purpura, gum bleeding, hemoptysis, hematemesis, hematuria, hemorrhagic shock","Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a condition in which blood clots form throughout the body, blocking small blood vessels. Symptoms may include chest pain, shortness of breath, leg pain, problems speaking, or problems moving parts of the body. As clotting factors and platelets are used up, bleeding may occur. This may include blood in the urine, blood in the stool, or bleeding into the skin. Complications may include organ failure."
Pediatric Tracheal and Bronchial Foreign Bodies,"Severe coughing, gasping, and even choking","Tracheobronchial injury is damage to the tracheobronchial tree (the airway structure involving the trachea and bronchi). It can result from blunt or penetrating trauma to the neck or chest, inhalation of harmful fumes or smoke, or aspiration of liquids or objects.
Though rare, TBI is a serious condition; it may cause obstruction of the airway with resulting life-threatening respiratory insufficiency. Other injuries accompany TBI in about half of cases. Of those people with TBI who die, most do so before receiving emergency care, either from airway obstruction, exsanguination, or from injuries to other vital organs."
Cerebrovascular disease,"Dizziness, headache, blindness, hemianopsia","Cerebrovascular disease includes a variety of medical conditions that affect the blood vessels of the brain and the cerebral circulation. Arteries supplying oxygen and nutrients to the brain are often damaged or deformed in these disorders. The most common presentation of cerebrovascular disease is an ischemic stroke or mini-stroke and sometimes a hemorrhagic stroke. Hypertension (high blood pressure) is the most important contributing risk factor for stroke and cerebrovascular diseases as it can change the structure of blood vessels and result in atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis narrows blood vessels in the brain, resulting in decreased cerebral perfusion."
Pneumococcal Pneumonia,"High fever, chills, muscle soreness, poor appetite, fatigue, restlessness, moaning, and shortness of breath","Pneumococcal pneumonia is a type of bacterial pneumonia that is caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). It is the most common bacterial pneumonia found in adults, the most common type of community-acquired pneumonia, and one of the common types of pneumococcal infection. The estimated number of Americans with pneumococcal pneumonia is 900,000 annually, with almost 400,000 cases hospitalized and fatalities accounting for 5-7% of these cases.


== Symptoms ==
The symptoms of pneumococcal pneumonia can occur suddenly, presenting as a severe chill, followed by a severe fever, cough, shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and chest pains. Other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, and muscle aches could also accompany initial symptoms."
Pericardial Mesothelioma,"Retrosternal pain, orthopnea, dyspnea, distended neck veins, lower limb edema, fatigue, pericardial effusion, hepatomegaly, fever, cardiac tamponade, chest pain","Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium). The area most commonly affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding each testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly."
Acute Superior Mesenteric Vein Thrombosis,"Constipation, abdominal distension, abdominal pain, erythema, and low-grade fever due to superficial vein thrombophlebitis","In human anatomy, the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) is a blood vessel that drains blood from the small intestine (jejunum and ileum). Behind the neck of the pancreas, the superior mesenteric vein combines with the splenic vein to form the portal vein that carries blood to the liver. The superior mesenteric vein lies to the right of the similarly named artery, the superior mesenteric artery, which originates from the abdominal aorta.


== Structure ==
Tributaries of the superior mesenteric vein drain the small intestine, large intestine, stomach, pancreas and appendix and include:

Right gastro-omental vein (also known as the right gastro-epiploic vein)
inferior pancreaticoduodenal veins
veins from jejunum
veins from ileum
middle colic vein  drains the transverse colon
right colic vein  drains the ascending colon
ileocolic vein
The superior mesenteric vein combines with the splenic vein to form the portal vein.


== Clinical significance ==
Thrombosis of the superior mesenteric vein is quite rare, but a significant cause of mesenteric ischemia and can be fatal."
Soft Palate Cancer,"Bad breath, temporal pain, asymmetric soft palate movement, food regurgitation into the nasal cavity, difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, trismus, difficulty opening mouth","Oropharyngeal cancer, also known as oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and tonsil cancer, is a disease in which abnormal cells with the potential to both grow locally and spread to other parts of the body are found in the oral cavity, in the tissue of the part of the throat (oropharynx) that includes the base of the tongue, the tonsils, the soft palate, and the walls of the pharynx.
The two types of oropharyngeal cancers are HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, which is caused by an oral human papillomavirus infection; and HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer, which is linked to use of alcohol, tobacco, or both.
Oropharyngeal cancer is diagnosed by biopsy of observed abnormal tissue in the throat. Oropharyngeal cancer  is staged according to the appearance of the abnormal cells on the biopsy coupled with the dimensions and the extent of the abnormal cells found. Treatment is with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy; or some combination of those treatments."
Complete Transposition of the Great Arteries,"Abnormal breathing, chest pain, cardiac murmur, cyanosis, displacement of the great arteries, abnormal heart sounds, heart failure","dextro-Transposition of the great arteries (d-Transposition of the great arteries, dextro-TGA, or d-TGA) is a potentially life-threatening birth defect in the large arteries of the heart. The primary arteries (the aorta and the pulmonary artery) are transposed.
It is called a cyanotic congenital heart defect (CHD) because the newborn infant turns blue from lack of oxygen. In segmental analysis, this condition is described as ventriculoarterial discordance with atrioventricular concordance, or just ventriculoarterial discordance. d-TGA is often referred to simply as transposition of the great arteries (TGA); however, TGA is a more general term which may also refer to levo-transposition of the great arteries (l-TGA).Another term commonly used to refer to both d-TGA and l-TGA is transposition of the great vessels (TGV), although this term might have an even broader meaning than TGA.
Prenatally, a baby with d-TGA experiences no symptoms as the lungs will not be used until after birth, and oxygen is provided by the mother via the placenta and umbilical cord; in order for the red blood to bypass the lungs in utero, the fetal heart has two shunts that begin to close when the newborn starts breathing; these are the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus."
Pesticide Poisoning Nephropathy,"Breath smelling like garlic, convulsions, incontinence of urine and feces, foaming at the mouth, dizziness, fatigue, abdominal pain","Lead poisoning, also known as plumbism and saturnism, is a type of metal poisoning caused by lead in the body. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, constipation, headaches, irritability, memory problems, infertility, numbness and tingling in the hands and feet. It causes almost 10% of intellectual disability of otherwise unknown cause and can result in behavioral problems. Some of the effects are permanent. In severe cases, anemia, seizures, coma, or death may occur."
Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome,"Alcohol-induced tremors, nausea and vomiting, facial flushing, anorexia, withdrawal seizures, dipsomania hallucinatory psychosis, tremors, delirium, convulsions, consciousness disorders, conjunctival congestion, tachycardia","Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is a set of symptoms that can occur following a reduction in or cessation of alcohol use after a period of excessive use. Symptoms typically include anxiety, shakiness, sweating, vomiting, fast heart rate, and a mild fever. More severe symptoms may include seizures, and delirium tremens (DTs); which can be fatal in untreated patients. Symptoms start at around 6 hours after the last drink. Peak incidence of seizures occurs at 24 to 36 hours and peak incidence of delirium tremens is at 48 to 72 hours."
Childhood Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis,"Maculopapular rash, fatigue, hepatosplenomegaly, high fever, lymphadenopathy, anemia, loss of appetite, wasting","In hematology, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), also known as haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (British spelling), and hemophagocytic or haemophagocytic syndrome, is an uncommon hematologic disorder seen more often in children than in adults. It is a life-threatening disease of severe hyperinflammation caused by uncontrolled proliferation of benign lymphocytes and macrophages that secrete high amounts of inflammatory cytokines. It is classified as one of the cytokine storm syndromes. There are inherited and non-inherited (acquired) causes of HLH.


== Signs and symptoms ==
HLH as defined by the HLH-04 criteria is a descriptive diagnosis. Its components are non-specific."
Adrenaline Toxicity,"Nausea and vomiting, pallor, tachycardia, muscle fiber tremors, convulsions, unsteady gait, high fever with chills, abnormal sweating, cardiac tremors, shock, abnormal pupil dilation, headache","An adrenergic storm is a sudden and dramatic increase in serum levels of the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline (also known as epinephrine and norepinephrine respectively), with a less significant increase in dopamine transmission. It is a life-threatening condition because of extreme tachycardia and hypertension, and is especially dire for those with prior heart problems. If treatment is prompt, prognosis is good; typically large amounts of diazepam or other benzodiazepines are administered alongside beta blockers. Beta blockers are contraindicated in some patients, so other antihypertensive medication such as clonidine may be used.
Antipsychotics are also used to treat the most severe psychiatric reactions such as psychosis, paranoia or terror, after their use was formerly discouraged because of their potential to prolong the QT interval; however, more recent research performed since 2019 has revealed that this and other severe side effects are rare and their occurrence does not warrant banning antipsychotics from the treatment of adrenergic crises for which they can be extremely useful."
Pediatric Respiratory Failure,"Cyanosis or pallor, irritability or somnolence, excessive sweating, in severe cases coma, convulsions, difficulty breathing, chest tightness, palpitations and arrhythmias, vomiting, bleeding","The Pediatric Assessment Triangle or PAT is a tool used in emergency medicine to form a general impression of a pediatric patient.  In emergency medicine, a general impression is formed the first time the medical professional views the patient, usually within seconds.  The PAT is a method of quickly determining the acuity of the child, identifying the type of pathophysiology, e.g.,  respiratory distress, respiratory failure, or shock and establishing urgency for treatment. The PAT also drives initial resuscitation and stabilization efforts based on the assessment findings.
The PAT is widely taught, among other contexts, in all American advanced pediatric life support courses for all types of providers (doctors, nurses, prehospital personnel) and hence represents both a validated practice and teaching tool."
Mitral Valve Prolapse Syndrome,"Chest tightness, chest pain, difficulty breathing, hemoptysis, cyanosis","Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a valvular heart disease characterized by the displacement of an abnormally thickened mitral valve leaflet into the left atrium during systole. It is the primary form of myxomatous degeneration of the valve. There are various types of MVP, broadly classified as classic and nonclassic. In severe cases of classic MVP, complications include mitral regurgitation, infective endocarditis, congestive heart failure, and, in rare circumstances, cardiac arrest.
The diagnosis of MVP primarily relies on echocardiography, which uses ultrasound to visualize the mitral valve."
Dermoid Cyst,Nodule,"A dermoid cyst is a teratoma of a cystic nature that contains an array of developmentally mature, solid tissues. It frequently consists of skin, hair follicles, and sweat glands, while other commonly found components include clumps of long hair, pockets of sebum, blood, fat, bone, nail, teeth, eyes, cartilage, and thyroid tissue.
As dermoid cysts grow slowly and contain mature tissue, this type of cystic teratoma is nearly always benign. In those rare cases wherein the dermoid cyst is malignant, a squamous cell carcinoma usually develops in adults, while infants and children usually present with an endodermal sinus tumor.:781


== Location ==
Due to its classification, a dermoid cyst can occur wherever a teratoma can occur.


=== Vaginal and ovarian dermoid cysts ===
Ovaries normally grow cyst-like structures called follicles each month."
Omental Torsion,"Gradually worsening right-sided abdominal pain, accompanied by anorexia, nausea, fever, nausea and vomiting, abdominal mass, abdominal pain, right lower abdominal tenderness, and abdominal muscle tension","Omental infarction, or omental torsion, is an acute vascular disorder which compromises tissue of the greater omentumthe largest peritoneal fold in the abdomen.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Patients will present with a sudden onset of cramps/abdominal pain or a 'stitch'. The pain localises in the area of the umbilicus and can radiate to the lumbar and surrounding regions.


== Causes ==
Omental infarction is a rare cause of acute abdomen pain with reported incidence being less than 4 per 1000 cases of appendicitis. Omental infarction usually presents as right-sided abdominal pain although seldom causing left-sided abdominal pain and even epigastric pain."
Hereditary Antithrombin III Deficiency,"Pulmonary embolism, Venous thrombosis","Antithrombin III deficiency (abbreviated ATIII deficiency) is a deficiency of antithrombin III. This deficiency may be inherited or acquired. It is a rare hereditary disorder that generally comes to light when a patient suffers recurrent venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and repetitive intrauterine fetal death (IUFD). Hereditary antithrombin deficiency results in a state of increased coagulation which may lead to venous thrombosis. Inheritance is usually autosomal dominant, though a few recessive cases have been noted. The disorder was first described by Egeberg in 1965."
Pediatric Antiphospholipid Syndrome,"Unilateral lower limb edema, pain, and multi-organ involvement with varying symptoms","Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS), also known as Asherson's syndrome, is a rare autoimmune disease in which widespread, intravascular clotting causes multi-organ failure. The syndrome is caused by antiphospholipid antibodies that target a group of proteins in the body that are associated with phospholipids. These antibodies activate endothelial cells, platelets, and immune cells, ultimately causing a large inflammatory immune response and widespread clotting. CAPS was first described by Ronald Asherson in 1992. The syndrome exhibits thrombotic microangiopathy, multiple organ thromboses, and in some cases  tissue necrosis and is considered an extreme or catastrophic variant of the antiphospholipid syndrome."
Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head in Children,"Hip joint pain, difficulty walking, limping, inability of the affected hip to flex or adduct","Avascular necrosis (AVN), also called osteonecrosis or bone infarction, is death of bone tissue due to interruption of the blood supply. Early on, there may be no symptoms. Gradually joint pain may develop, which may limit the person's ability to move. Complications may include collapse of the bone or nearby joint surface.
Risk factors include bone fractures, joint dislocations, alcoholism, and the use of high-dose steroids."
Atherosclerosis,"Dizziness, angina pectoris, chest pain, headache, abnormal heart sounds, cardiac murmurs, vessel hardening, artery elongation and twisting, atherosclerotic plaque","Atherosclerosis is a pattern of the disease arteriosclerosis, characterized by development of abnormalities called lesions in walls of arteries. This is a chronic inflammatory disease involving many different cell types and is driven by elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood. These lesions may lead to narrowing of the arterial walls due to buildup of atheromatous plaques. At the onset there are usually no symptoms, but if they develop, symptoms generally begin around middle age. In severe cases, it can result in coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or kidney disorders, depending on which body part(s) the affected arteries are located in the body."
Crescentic Glomerulonephritis,"Abrupt onset, hematuria, proteinuria, oliguria, edema, hypertension, anuria or oliguria","Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is a syndrome of the kidney that is characterized by a rapid loss of kidney function, (usually a 50% decline in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) within 3 months) with glomerular crescent formation seen in at least 50% or 75% of glomeruli seen on kidney biopsies. If left untreated, it rapidly progresses into acute kidney failure and death within months. In 50% of cases, RPGN is associated with an underlying disease such as Goodpasture syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus or granulomatosis with polyangiitis; the remaining cases are idiopathic. Regardless of the underlying cause, RPGN involves severe injury to the kidneys' glomeruli, with many of the glomeruli containing characteristic glomerular crescents (crescent-shaped scars).


== Signs and symptoms ==
Most types of RPGN are characterized by severe and rapid loss of kidney function with marked hematuria; red blood cell casts in the urine; and proteinuria sometimes exceeding three grams in twenty-four hours, a range associated with nephrotic syndrome."
Breast Liposarcoma,"Subcutaneous mass in the breast, not adherent to the skin, variable size of the tumor, flat and round shape, clear boundaries, painless","A sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that arises from cells of mesenchymal origin. Originating from mesenchymal cells means that sarcomas are cancers of connective tissues such as bone, cartilage, muscle, fat, or vascular tissues. 
Sarcomas are one of five different types of cancer, classified by the cell type from which they originate. While there are five types under this category, sarcomas are most frequently contrasted with carcinomas which are much more common. Sarcomas are quite rare, making up about 1% of all adult cancer diagnoses and 15% of childhood cancer diagnoses."
Acute Appendicitis in the Elderly,"Periappendiceal abscess, severe abdominal pain accompanied by constipation, lower abdominal colic, appendiceal perforation, fever, abdominal pain, right lower quadrant pain with vomiting, abdominal distension, acute abdomen, persistent severe pain in the right upper abdomen radiating to the right shoulder, right back pain, tenderness in the right lower quadrant","Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix. Symptoms commonly include right lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever and decreased appetite. However, approximately 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms. Severe complications of a ruptured appendix include widespread, painful inflammation of the inner lining of the abdominal wall and sepsis.
Appendicitis is primarily caused by a blockage of the hollow portion in the appendix."
Cardiac Metastasis,"May present with congestive heart failure, various types of ectopic beats and tachyarrhythmias, involvement of the interventricular septum and conduction system leading to atrioventricular or intraventricular conduction disorders","Cardiac metastases (CMs) are more common than primary cardiac tumors, with autopsy studies reporting incidence rates between 2.3% and 18.3%. Their increasing detection is largely attributed to advances in cancer treatments, which have extended patient survival. CMs may present with diverse clinical manifestations depending on their size, location, and extent of infiltration, although they often remain asymptomatic and are identified only postmortem."
Benign Fibrous Histiocytoma,"Commonly occurs at the metaphysis of long bones, experiencing persistent moderate swelling and pain","A dermatofibroma, or benign fibrous histiocytomas, is a benign nodule in the skin, typically on the legs, elbows or chest of an adult. It is usually painless.
It usually ranges from 0.2 to 2 cm in size but larger examples have been reported. It typically results from mild trauma such as an insect bite. Risk factors for developing multiple dermatofibromas include lupus, HIV, blood cancer and some medicines that weaken immunity."
Hydatid Disease,"Affected areas may experience mild pain and a sense of heaviness, decreased appetite, weight loss, emaciation, developmental disorders, skin itching, urticaria, and edema.","Alveolar hydatid disease (AHD) is a form of echinococcosis, or a disease that originates from a parasitic flatworm. AHD is caused by an infection of the flatworm species Echinococcus multilocularis. Although alveolar echinococcosis is rarely diagnosed in humans and is not as widespread as cystic echinococcosis (caused by Echinococcus granulosus), it is also still a serious disease that has a significantly high fatality rate. It is considered one of the most life-threatening helminthic infections humans can have.
It is most prevalent in China, Eastern France, Switzerland, Austria, Bulgaria, Turkey, Iran, Japan, Afghanistan, and Russia, and is mostly confined to the Northern hemisphere, south to around the 40th or 45th degree of Northern latitude, save some cases reported in Northern Africa."
Delayed Traumatic Intracerebral Hematoma,"Headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), also known as hemorrhagic stroke, is a sudden bleeding into the tissues of the brain (i.e. the parenchyma), into its ventricles, or into both. An ICH is a type of bleeding within the skull and one kind of stroke (ischemic stroke being the other). Symptoms can vary dramatically depending on the severity (how much blood), acuity (over what timeframe), and location (anatomically) but can include headache, one-sided weakness, numbness, tingling, or paralysis, speech problems, vision or hearing problems, memory loss, attention problems, coordination problems, balance problems, dizziness or lightheadedness or vertigo, nausea/vomiting, seizures, decreased level of consciousness or total loss of consciousness, neck stiffness, and fever.
Hemorrhagic stroke may occur on the background of alterations to the blood vessels in the brain, such as cerebral arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral arteriovenous malformation, brain trauma, brain tumors and an intracranial aneurysm, which can cause intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage."
Congenital Renal Malformation,"Oliguria, back pain, hematuria, frequent urination","A congenital heart defect (CHD), also known as a congenital heart anomaly, congenital cardiovascular malformation, and congenital heart disease, is a defect in the structure of the heart or great vessels that is present at birth. A congenital heart defect is classed as a cardiovascular disease. Signs and symptoms depend on the specific type of defect. Symptoms can vary from none to life-threatening. When present, symptoms are variable and may include rapid breathing, bluish skin (cyanosis), poor weight gain, and feeling tired."
X-linked Agammaglobulinemia (XLA),"Recurrent infections, bacterial infections, diarrhea, vomiting, paralysis, hemolytic anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, hair loss, malabsorption syndrome, amyloidosis","X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is a rare genetic disorder discovered in 1952 that affects the body's ability to fight infection. As the form of agammaglobulinemia that is X-linked, it is much more common in males. In people with XLA, the white blood cell formation process does not generate mature B cells, which manifests as a complete or near-complete lack of proteins called gamma globulins, including antibodies, in their bloodstream. B cells are part of the immune system and normally manufacture antibodies (also called immunoglobulins), which defend the body from infections by sustaining a humoral immunity response. Patients with untreated XLA are prone to develop serious and even fatal infections."
Spontaneous Pneumothorax,"Sudden onset of chest pain, difficulty breathing, chest tightness, severe cases manifest with restlessness, profuse sweating, cyanosis, rapid breathing, tracheal deviation towards the healthy side, and fullness of the chest on the affected side","A pneumothorax is collection of air in the pleural space between the lung and the chest wall. Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp, one-sided chest pain and shortness of breath. In a minority of cases, a one-way valve is formed by an area of damaged tissue, and the amount of air in the space between chest wall and lungs increases; this is called a tension pneumothorax. This can cause a steadily worsening oxygen shortage and low blood pressure. This leads to a type of shock called obstructive shock, which can be fatal unless reversed."
Tuberculosis of Joint,"Radiating pain, stiffness, deformity, spinal compression signs, low-grade fever, fatigue, anorexia, and general malaise","Tuberculosis (TB), also known colloquially as the ""white death"", or historically as consumption, is a contagious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) bacteria. Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections show no symptoms, in which case it is known as inactive or latent tuberculosis. A small proportion of latent infections progress to active disease that, if left untreated, can be fatal. Typical symptoms of active TB are chronic cough with blood-containing mucus, fever, night sweats, and weight loss."
Protein-Energy Malnutrition (PEM),"Decreased muscle strength, emaciation, underweight","Proteinenergy undernutrition (PEU), once called proteinenergy malnutrition (PEM), is a form of malnutrition that is defined as a range of conditions arising from coincident lack of dietary protein and/or energy (calories) in varying proportions. The condition has mild, moderate, and severe degrees.

Types include:

Kwashiorkor (protein malnutrition predominant)
Marasmus (deficiency in calorie intake)
Marasmic kwashiorkor (marked protein deficiency and marked calorie insufficiency signs present, sometimes referred to as the most severe form of malnutrition)
PEU is fairly common worldwide in both children and adults and accounts for about 250,000 deaths annually. In the industrialized world, PEM is predominantly seen in hospitals, is associated with disease, or is often found in the elderly.
Note that PEU may be secondary to other conditions such as chronic renal disease or cancer cachexia in which protein energy wasting (PEW) may occur."
Inhalation Injury,"Injury below the bronchi, increased lung water content, injury above the tracheal carina, abnormal respiration, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), respiratory distress syndrome, difficulty swallowing, laryngeal edema","Acute inhalation injury may result from frequent and widespread use of household cleaning agents and industrial gases (including chlorine and ammonia). The airways and lungs receive continuous first-pass exposure to non-toxic and irritant or toxic gases via inhalation. Irritant gases are those that, on inhalation, dissolve in the water of the respiratory tract mucosa and provoke an inflammatory response, usually from the release of acidic or alkaline radicals. Smoke, chlorine, phosgene, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, and ammonia are common irritants.
Depending on the type and amount of irritant gas inhaled, victims can experience symptoms ranging from minor respiratory discomfort to acute airway and lung injury and even death."
Food Stagnation Gastric Disease,"Abdominal distension, sour belching, loss of appetite, constipation, nausea and vomiting","Esophageal cancer (American English) or oesophageal cancer (British English) is cancer arising from the esophagusthe food pipe that runs between the throat and the stomach. Symptoms often include difficulty in swallowing and weight loss. Other symptoms may include pain when swallowing, a hoarse voice, enlarged lymph nodes (""glands"") around the collarbone, a dry cough, and possibly coughing up or vomiting blood.
The two main sub-types of the disease are esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (often abbreviated to ESCC), which is more common in the developing world, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which is more common in the developed world. A number of less common types also occur."
Pediatric Food Poisoning,"Nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dehydration, coma, metabolic acidosis, convulsions, headache, shock, watery stools, fatigue, pus and blood in stool","Iron poisoning typically occurs from ingestion of excess iron that results in acute toxicity. Mild symptoms which occur within hours include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and drowsiness. In more severe cases, symptoms can include tachypnea, low blood pressure, seizures, or coma. If left untreated, acute iron poisoning can lead to multi-organ failure resulting in permanent organ damage or death.
Iron is available over the counter as a single entity supplement in an iron salt form or in combination with vitamin supplements and is commonly used in the treatment of anemias."
Intraspinal Tumor,"Radicular pain, sensory disturbances, motor dysfunction, rectal dysfunction, bladder dysfunction","A brain tumor (sometimes referred more commonly as brain cancer) occurs when a group of cells within the brain turn cancerous and grow out of control, creating a mass. There are two main types of tumors: malignant (cancerous) tumors and benign (non-cancerous) tumors. These can be further classified as primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which most commonly have spread from tumors located outside the brain, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the size of the tumor and the part of the brain that is involved. Where symptoms exist, they may include headaches, seizures, problems with vision, vomiting and mental changes."
Electrocution,"Cardiac arrest, shock, hypotension","Electrocution is death or severe injury  caused by electric shock from electric current passing through the body. The word is derived from ""electro"" and ""execution"", but it is also used for accidental death.
The term ""electrocution"" was coined in 1889 in the US just before the first use of the electric chair and originally referred to only electrical execution and not other electrical deaths. However, since no English word was available for non-judicial deaths due to electric shock, the word ""electrocution"" eventually took over as a description of all circumstances of electrical death from the new commercial electricity.


== Origins ==

In the Netherlands, in 1746, Pieter van Musschenbroek's lab assistant, Andreas Cuneus, received an extreme shock while working with a leyden jar, the first recorded injury from human-made electricity."
Avascular Necrosis of the Femoral Head,"Hip joint pain, intermittent claudication, osteoporosis","Avascular necrosis (AVN), also called osteonecrosis or bone infarction, is death of bone tissue due to interruption of the blood supply. Early on, there may be no symptoms. Gradually joint pain may develop, which may limit the person's ability to move. Complications may include collapse of the bone or nearby joint surface.
Risk factors include bone fractures, joint dislocations, alcoholism, and the use of high-dose steroids."
Hemorrhagic salpingitis,"Irregular vaginal bleeding, lower abdominal pain with a sensation of prolapse to the anus, abdominal pain starting on one side of the abdomen, followed by continuous pain in the lower abdomen","Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), also known as pelvic inflammatory disorder, is an infection of the upper part of the female reproductive system, mainly the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often, there may be no symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present, may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, bleeding after sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long-term complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.
The disease is caused by bacteria that spread from the vagina and cervix."
Salicylate Poisoning,"Nausea and vomiting, headache, drowsiness, limb numbness, abdominal pain, coma, diarrhea, cough, tinnitus, hemoptysis, hematemesis, melena","Salicylate poisoning, also known as aspirin poisoning, is the acute or chronic poisoning with a salicylate such as aspirin. The classic symptoms are ringing in the ears, nausea, abdominal pain, and a fast breathing rate. Early on, these may be subtle, while larger doses may result in fever. Complications can include swelling of the brain or lungs, seizures, low blood sugar, or cardiac arrest.
While usually due to aspirin, other possible causes include oil of wintergreen and bismuth subsalicylate."
Tumor Lysis Syndrome,"Skin ulceration, tissue swelling, tissue pain","Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a group of metabolic abnormalities that can occur as a complication from the treatment of cancer, where large amounts of tumor cells are killed off (lysed) from the treatment, releasing their contents into the bloodstream. This occurs most commonly after the treatment of lymphomas and leukemias and in particular when treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This is a potentially fatal complication and people at an increased risk for TLS should be closely monitored while receiving chemotherapy and should receive preventive measures and treatments as necessary. TLS can also occur on its own (while not being treated with chemotherapy) although this is less common.
Tumor lysis syndrome is characterized by high blood potassium (hyperkalemia), high blood phosphate (hyperphosphatemia), low blood calcium (hypocalcemia), high blood uric acid (hyperuricemia), and higher than normal levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN)."
Hypertension,"Dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, palpitations, shortness of breath","Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms itself. It is, however, a major risk factor for stroke, coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, vision loss, chronic kidney disease, and dementia. Hypertension is a major cause of premature death worldwide.
High blood pressure is classified as primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension."
Primary Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma,"Color blindness to green, reduced sensitivity to green, sudden and rapid increase in intraocular pressure, difficulty in upward gaze, epiphora, vision impairment, corneal opacity, abnormal pupil, constricted visual field, deformed pupil, lens glaucomflecken, eye pain","Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can lead to damage of the optic nerve. The optic nerve transmits visual information from the eye to the brain. Glaucoma may cause vision loss if left untreated. It has been called the ""silent thief of sight"" because the loss of vision usually occurs slowly over a long period of time. A major risk factor for glaucoma is increased pressure within the eye, known as intraocular pressure (IOP)."
Visceral Leishmaniasis,"Persistent fever, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, referred pain, visceral pain, headache, epistaxis, fatigue, malaise, weakness","Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar (Hindi: kl zr, ""black sickness"") or ""black fever"", is the most severe form of leishmaniasis and, without proper diagnosis and treatment, is associated with high fatality. Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania.
The parasite migrates to the internal organs such as the liver, spleen (hence ""visceral""), and bone marrow, and, if left untreated, will almost always result in the death of the host. Signs and symptoms include fever, weight loss, fatigue, anemia, and substantial swelling of the liver and spleen. Of particular concern, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), is the emerging problem of HIV/VL co-infection."
Hypertensive Cardiomyopathy,"Hypertension, difficulty breathing, palpitations, arrhythmia","Hypertensive heart disease includes a number of complications of high blood pressure that affect the heart. While there are several definitions of hypertensive heart disease in the medical literature, the term is most widely used in the context of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding categories. The definition includes heart failure and other cardiac complications of hypertension when a causal relationship between the heart disease and hypertension is stated or implied on the death certificate. In 2013 hypertensive heart disease resulted in 1.07 million deaths as compared with 630,000 deaths in 1990.
According to ICD-10, hypertensive heart disease (I11), and its subcategories: hypertensive heart disease with heart failure (I11.0) and hypertensive heart disease without heart failure (I11.9) are distinguished from chronic rheumatic heart diseases (I05-I09),  other forms of heart disease (I30-I52) and ischemic heart diseases (I20-I25)."
Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Coughing, hemoptysis, wheezing, chest tightness, dyspnea, weight loss, fever","Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or non-small-cell lung carcinoma, is any type of epithelial lung cancer other than small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC accounts for about 85% of all lung cancers. As a class, NSCLCs are relatively insensitive to chemotherapy, compared to small-cell carcinoma. When possible, they are primarily treated by surgical resection with curative intent, although chemotherapy has been used increasingly both preoperatively (neoadjuvant chemotherapy) and postoperatively (adjuvant chemotherapy).


== Types ==

The most common types of NSCLC are squamous-cell carcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma, but several other types occur less frequently."
Atherosclerosis,"Dizziness, angina pectoris, chest pain, headache, abnormal heart sounds, cardiac murmurs, vessel hardening, artery elongation and twisting, atherosclerotic plaque","Atherosclerosis is a pattern of the disease arteriosclerosis, characterized by development of abnormalities called lesions in walls of arteries. This is a chronic inflammatory disease involving many different cell types and is driven by elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood. These lesions may lead to narrowing of the arterial walls due to buildup of atheromatous plaques. At the onset there are usually no symptoms, but if they develop, symptoms generally begin around middle age. In severe cases, it can result in coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, or kidney disorders, depending on which body part(s) the affected arteries are located in the body."
Hamartoma,"Nausea, vomiting, back pain, hematuria, cough, sputum production, epilepsy, intellectual decline","A hematoma, also spelled haematoma, or blood suffusion is a localized bleeding outside of blood vessels, due to either disease or trauma including injury or surgery and may involve blood continuing to seep from broken capillaries. A hematoma is benign and is initially in liquid form spread among the tissues including in sacs between tissues where it may coagulate and solidify before blood is reabsorbed into blood vessels. An ecchymosis is a hematoma of the skin larger than 10 mm.
They may occur among and or within many areas such as skin and other organs, connective tissues, bone, joints and muscle.
A collection of blood (or even a hemorrhage) may be aggravated by anticoagulant medication (blood thinner)."
Congenital Pulmonary Hypoplasia,"Difficulty breathing, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Recurrent Upper Respiratory Tract Infections, Thoracic deformity","Pulmonary hypoplasia is an incomplete development of the lungs, resulting in an abnormally low number or small size of bronchopulmonary segments or alveoli.  A congenital malformation, most often occurs secondary to other fetal abnormalities that interfere with normal development of the lungs.  Primary (idiopathic) pulmonary hypoplasia is rare and usually not associated with other maternal or fetal abnormalities.
Incidence of pulmonary hypoplasia ranges from 911 per 10,000 live births and 14 per 10,000 births.  Pulmonary hypoplasia is a relatively common cause of neonatal death."
Adrenal Insufficiency,"Fatigue, lethargy, decreased appetite, nausea, weight loss, dizziness, orthostatic hypotension","Adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce adequate amounts of steroid hormones. The adrenal glandsalso referred to as the adrenal cortexnormally secrete glucocorticoids (primarily cortisol), mineralocorticoids (primarily aldosterone), and androgens. These hormones are important in regulating blood pressure, electrolytes, and metabolism as a whole. Deficiency of these hormones leads to symptoms ranging from abdominal pain, vomiting, muscle weakness and fatigue, low blood pressure, depression, mood and personality changes (in mild cases) to organ failure and shock (in severe cases). Adrenal crisis may occur if a person having adrenal insufficiency experiences stresses, such as an accident, injury, surgery, or severe infection; this is a life-threatening medical condition resulting from severe deficiency of cortisol in the body."
Malignant Seminal Vesicle Tumor,"Intermittent hematuria, urgent but incomplete micturition, cyst formation, urinary frequency, thick gel-like substance in urine, hemospermia, difficulty in urination and urinary retention","Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT), also known as fibrous tumor of the pleura, is a rare mesenchymal tumor originating in the pleura or at virtually any site in the soft tissue including the seminal vesicle. Approximately 78% to 88% of SFT's are benign and 12% to 22% are malignant. The World Health Organization (2020) classified SFT as a specific type of tumor in the category of malignant fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors. 


== Signs and symptoms ==
About 80% of pleural SFTs originate in the visceral pleura, while 20% arise from parietal pleura. Although they are often very large tumors (up to 40 cm."
Anterior Spinal Artery Syndrome,"Lower back pain, sensory disturbances, gastrointestinal bloating, paralysis, persistent dull pain in the lower back","Anterior spinal artery syndrome (also known as ""anterior spinal cord syndrome"") is syndrome caused by ischemia of the area supplied by the  anterior spinal artery, resulting in loss of function of the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord. The region affected includes the descending  corticospinal tract, ascending spinothalamic tract, and autonomic fibers. It is characterized by a corresponding loss of motor function, loss of pain and temperature sensation, and hypotension.
Anterior spinal artery syndrome is the most common form of spinal cord infarction. The anterior spinal cord is at increased risk for infarction because it is supplied by the single anterior spinal artery and has little collateral circulation, unlike the posterior spinal cord which is supplied by two posterior spinal arteries."
Tricyclic Antidepressant Poisoning,"Fever, seizures and seizure-like episodes, respiratory depression, cardiac arrhythmias, abnormal pupil size, cardiac tremors, palpitations, coma, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, dry mouth, headache","Tricyclic antidepressant overdose is poisoning caused by excessive medication of the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) type. Symptoms may include elevated body temperature, blurred vision, dilated pupils, sleepiness, confusion, seizures, rapid heart rate, and cardiac arrest. If symptoms have not occurred within six hours of exposure they are unlikely to occur.
TCA overdose may occur by accident or purposefully in an attempt to cause death. The toxic dose depends on the specific TCA. Most are non-toxic at less than 5 mg/kg except for desipramine, nortriptyline, and trimipramine, which are generally non-toxic at less than 2.5 mg/kg."
Hypoglycemia in the Elderly,"Dizziness, cold sweat, nausea, pale complexion","Hypoglycemia (American English), also spelled hypoglycaemia or hypoglycmia (British English), sometimes called low blood sugar, is a fall in blood sugar to levels below normal, typically below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). Whipple's triad is used to properly identify hypoglycemic episodes. It is defined as blood glucose below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), symptoms associated with hypoglycemia, and resolution of symptoms when blood sugar returns to normal. Hypoglycemia may result in headache, tiredness, clumsiness, trouble talking, confusion, fast heart rate, sweating, shakiness, nervousness, hunger, loss of consciousness, seizures, or death. Symptoms typically come on quickly."
Bladder Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"Bladder dysfunction, hematuria, pain in the bladder area before and after urination, frequent urination accompanied by urgency and dysuria","Squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC),  also known as epidermoid carcinoma, comprises a number of different types of cancer that begin in squamous cells. These cells form on the surface of the skin, on the lining of hollow organs in the body, and on the lining of the respiratory and digestive tracts.
The squamous-cell carcinomas of different body sites can show differences in their presented symptoms, natural history, prognosis, and response to treatment.


== By body location ==
Human papillomavirus infection has been associated with SCCs of the oropharynx, lung, fingers, and anogenital region.


=== Head and neck cancer ===

About 90% of cases of head and neck cancer (cancer of the mouth, nasal cavity, nasopharynx, throat and associated structures) are due to SCC.


=== Skin ===
Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma is the second most common skin cancer, accounting for over 1 million cases in the United States each year."
Pelvic Abscess,"Elevated body temperature, rapid pulse, discomfort or dull pain in the lower abdomen, increased frequency of bowel movements with mucous stools and proctalgia fugax, frequent and painful urination and other symptoms of bladder irritation, tenderness in the lower abdomen","Pelvic abscess is a collection of pus in the pelvis, typically occurring following lower abdominal surgical procedures, or as a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), appendicitis, or lower genital tract infections. Signs and symptoms include a high fever, pelvic mass, vaginal bleeding or discharge, and lower abdominal pain. It can lead to sepsis and death.
Blood tests typically show a raised white cell count. Other tests generally include urine pregnancy test, blood and exudate culture, and vaginal wet mount."
Acute Monocytic Leukemia,"Pale complexion, fatigue, bleeding, joint pain, swelling","Acute monocytic leukemia (AMoL, or AML-M5) is a type of acute myeloid leukemia. In AML-M5 >80% of the leukemic cells are of monocytic lineage. This cancer is characterized by a dominance of monocytes in the bone marrow. There is an overproduction of monocytes that the body does not need in the periphery. These overproduced monocytes interfere with normal immune cell production which causes many health complications for the affected individual."
Thyroid Nodules,"Difficulty breathing, Easily agitated, Presence of thyroid nodules","Thyroid nodules are nodules (raised areas of tissue or fluid) which commonly arise within an otherwise normal thyroid gland. They may be hyperplastic or  tumorous, but only a small percentage of thyroid tumors are malignant. Small, asymptomatic nodules are common, and often go unnoticed. Nodules that grow larger or produce symptoms may eventually need medical care. A goitre may have one nodule  uninodular, multiple nodules  multinodular, or be diffuse."
Compressive Optic Neuropathy,"Eye pain, vision often appears as a foggy blur, blackout, hemianopia, retrobulbar neuritis, optic atrophy, and visual field defects","Optic neuropathy is damage to the optic nerve from any cause. The optic nerve is a bundle of millions of fibers in the retina that sends visual signals to the brain.
Damage and death of these nerve cells, or neurons, leads to characteristic features of optic neuropathy. The main symptom is loss of vision, with colors appearing subtly washed out in the affected eye. A pale disc is characteristic of long-standing optic neuropathy."
Ewing's Sarcoma,"Pain, swelling at the site of the lesion, fever, anemia, poor mental appetite","Ewing sarcoma is a type of pediatric cancer that forms in bone or soft tissue. Symptoms may include swelling and pain at the site of the tumor, fever, and a bone fracture. The most common areas where it begins are the legs, pelvis, and chest wall. In about 25% of cases, the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis. Complications may include a pleural effusion or paraplegia."
Myocardial Infarction Complicated by Mitral Valve Regurgitation,"Decreased blood pressure, shock, heart failure, systolic murmur","Myocardial infarction complications may occur immediately following a myocardial infarction (heart attack) (in the acute phase), or may need time to develop (a chronic problem). After an infarction, an obvious complication is a second infarction, which may occur in the domain of another atherosclerotic coronary artery, or in the same zone if there are any live cells left in the infarct.

Post-myocardial complications occur after a period of ischemia, these changes can be seen in gross tissue changes and microscopic changes. Necrosis begins after 20 minutes of an infarction.  Under 4 hours of ischemia, there are no gross or microscopic changes noted."
Pediatric Subdural Hematoma,"Irritability, abnormal breathing, unequal pupil size, coma, vomiting, epileptic seizures, sensory disturbances, restlessness, convulsions","Pediatric stroke is a stroke that occurs in children or adolescents.  Stroke affects an estimated 2.5 to 13 per 100,000 children annually.
The signs and symptoms of stroke in children, infants, and newborns are different from those in adults. The causes and risk factors of stroke in children are also different from those in adults. Children have hemorrhagic strokes at the same rate in which they have ischemic strokes, while adults are more likely to have ischemic strokes."
Coxsackievirus Infection,"Fever, dysphagia, sore throat, papules, maculopapular rash, vesicles, nausea and vomiting, rhinorrhea, cough, malaise","Coxsackieviruses are a few related enteroviruses that belong to the Picornaviridae family of nonenveloped, linear, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, as well as its genus Enterovirus, which also includes poliovirus and echovirus. Enteroviruses are among the most common and important human pathogens, and ordinarily its members are transmitted by the fecaloral route. Coxsackieviruses share many characteristics with poliovirus. With control of poliovirus infections in much of the world, more attention has been focused on understanding the nonpolio enteroviruses such as coxsackievirus.
Coxsackieviruses are among the leading causes of aseptic meningitis (the other usual suspects being echovirus and mumps virus)."
Calcifying Epithelioma,"Skin nodules, skin ulceration, skin itching","Pilomatricoma is a benign skin tumor derived from the hair matrix. These neoplasms are relatively uncommon and typically occur on the scalp, face, and upper extremities. Clinically, pilomatricomas present as a subcutaneous nodule or cyst with unremarkable overlying epidermis that can range in size from 0.5 to 3.0 cm, but the largest reported case was 24 cm.


== Presentation ==


=== Associations ===
Pilomatricomas have been observed in a variety of genetic disorders including Turner syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, RubinsteinTaybi syndrome, trisomy 9, and Gardner syndrome. It has been reported that the prevalence of pilomatricomas in Turner syndrome is 2.6%."
Group B Streptococcus Infection,"Fever, dizziness, vomiting, diarrhea, hepatomegaly","Group B streptococcal infection, also known as Group B streptococcal disease or just Group B strep infection, is the infectious disease caused by the bacterium Streptococcus agalactiae. Streptococcus agalactiae is the most common human pathogen belonging to group B of the Lancefield classification of streptococcihence the name of group B stretococcal (GBS). Infection with GBS can cause serious illness and sometimes death, especially in newborns, the elderly, and people with compromised immune systems.
The most severe form of group B streptococcal disease is neonatal meningitis in infants, which is frequently lethal and can cause permanent neuro-cognitive impairment.

S. agalactiae was recognized as a pathogen in cattle by Edmond Nocard and Mollereau in the late 1880s."
Infective Endocarditis,"Chills and fever, heart murmur, anemia, enlarged spleen, coughing and wheezing, breathlessness, inability to lie flat","Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner surface of the heart (endocardium), usually the valves. Signs and symptoms may include fever, small areas of bleeding into the skin, heart murmur, feeling tired, and low red blood cell count. Complications may include backward blood flow in the heart, heart failure  the heart struggling to pump a sufficient amount of blood to meet the body's needs, abnormal electrical conduction in the heart, stroke, and kidney failure.
The cause is typically a bacterial infection and less commonly a fungal infection. Risk factors include valvular heart disease, including rheumatic disease, congenital heart disease, artificial valves, hemodialysis, intravenous drug use, and electronic pacemakers."
Hemolytic Anemia,"High fever with chills, lower back pain, weakness and aching of limbs, pale complexion, headache, vomiting, jaundice, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, impaired liver function, evidence of hemolysis, and enlargement of the liver and spleen.","Hemolytic anemia or haemolytic anaemia is a form of anemia due to hemolysis, the abnormal breakdown of red blood cells (RBCs), either in the blood vessels (intravascular hemolysis) or elsewhere in the human body (extravascular). This most commonly occurs within the spleen, but also can occur in the reticuloendothelial system or mechanically (prosthetic valve damage). Hemolytic anemia accounts for 5% of all existing anemias. It has numerous possible consequences, ranging from general symptoms to life-threatening systemic effects. The general classification of hemolytic anemia is either intrinsic or extrinsic."
Hypocalcemia and Hypomagnesemia,"Irritability, delirium, anxiety, limb convulsions, convulsions, facial muscle twitching, pyrrolidine and guanidineuria, positive Trousseau sign, sudden convulsions during sleep, the appearance of stripes or spots on fingernails","Hypocalcemia is a medical condition characterized by low calcium levels in the blood serum. The normal range of blood calcium is typically between 2.12.6 mmol/L (8.810.7 mg/dL, 4.35.2 mEq/L), while levels less than 2.1 mmol/L are defined as hypocalcemic. Mildly low levels that develop slowly often have no symptoms. Otherwise symptoms may include numbness, muscle spasms, seizures, confusion, or in extreme cases cardiac arrest.
The most common cause for hypocalcemia is iatrogenic hypoparathyroidism."
Orbital Cavernous Hemangioma,"Vascular malformations, exophthalmos, eyelid swelling and presenting a pale green color","Cavernous hemangioma, also called cavernous angioma, venous malformation, or cavernoma, is a type of venous malformation due to endothelial dysmorphogenesis from a lesion which is present at birth. A cavernoma in the brain is called a cerebral cavernous malformation or CCM.  Despite its designation as a hemangioma, a cavernous hemangioma is a benign (but not harmless) condition, not a malignant tumor, as it does not display endothelial hyperplasia. The abnormal tissue causes a slowing of blood flow through the cavities, or ""caverns"". The blood vessels do not form the necessary junctions with surrounding cells, and the structural support from the smooth muscle is hindered, causing leakage into the surrounding tissue. It is the leakage of blood (hemorrhage) that causes a variety of symptoms known to be associated with the condition."
Breast Cysticercosis,"Nodules, a variable number of soybean-sized nodules in the breast, detection of eggs or gravid proglottids in the feces","An ocular manifestation of a systemic disease is an eye condition that directly or indirectly results from a disease process in another part of the body. There are many diseases known to cause ocular or visual changes. Diabetes, for example, is the leading cause of new cases of blindness in those aged 2074, with ocular manifestations such as diabetic retinopathy and macular edema affecting up to 80% of those who have had the disease for 15 years or more. Other diseases such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and hypertension are commonly found to have associated ocular symptoms.

Traumatic Splenic Rupture,"Diffuse abdominal pain, prominent pain in the left subcostal area, abdominal muscle tension, thirst, palpitations, tinnitus, limb weakness, shortness of breath, drop in blood pressure, unclear consciousness","A splenic injury, which includes a ruptured spleen, is any injury to the spleen. The rupture of a normal spleen can be caused by trauma, such as a traffic collision.


== Signs and symptoms ==
In minor injuries with little bleeding, there may be abdominal pain, tenderness in the epigastrium and pain in the left flank. Often there is a sharp pain in the left shoulder, known as Kehr's sign. In larger injuries with more extensive bleeding, signs of hypovolemic shock are most prominent."
Obesity in the Elderly,"Edema, anxiety, depression, snoring, sleep apnea, respiratory failure, sudden death, back and waist pain, muscle soreness, hip joint pain, shoulder joint pain, hypertension","Obesity is common in the United States and is a major health issue associated with numerous diseases, specifically an increased risk of certain types of cancer, coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and cardiovascular disease, as well as significant increases in early mortality and economic costs. 


== Statistics ==

The CDC defines an adult (a person aged 20 years or greater) with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater as obese and an adult with a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9 as overweight. Obesity in adults is divided into three categories. Adults with a BMI of 30 to 34.9 have class 1 obesity; adults with a BMI of 35 to 39.9 have class 2 obesity; adults with a BMI of 40 or greater have class 3 obesity, which is also known as extreme or severe obesity (and was formerly known as morbid obesity). Children (persons aged 2 to 19 years) with a BMI at or above the 95th percentile of children of the same age and sex are defined as obese, and children with a BMI at or above the 85th percentile but less than the 95th percentile are defined as overweight."
Syringocystadenoma Papilliferum,"Increased sweating upon cold exposure, noticeable body odor, lactation disorder, subcutaneous nodules","Syringocystadenoma papilliferum is a rare non-malignant adnexal neoplasm that develops from apocrine or eccrine sweat glands and can be identified histologically by cystic, papillary, and ductal invaginations into the dermis lined by double-layered outer cuboidal and luminal high columnar epithelium and connected to the epidermis.
Lesions have a heterogeneous, non-distinctive appearance that ranges from skin-colored to pink-colored papules or plaques. Typically, lesions form in the head and neck area.
Syringocystadenoma papilliferum can develop de-novo or within a nevus sebaceous. Syringocystadenoma papilliferum tends to be seen in children."
Hemiplegia,"Motor dysfunction, hemiplegic gait, consciousness disorder, significantly increased muscle tone","Hemiparesis, also called unilateral paresis, is the weakness of one entire side of the body (hemi- means ""half""). Hemiplegia, in its most severe form, is the complete paralysis of one entire side of the body. Either hemiparesis or hemiplegia can result from a variety of medical causes, including congenital conditions, trauma, tumors, traumatic brain injury and stroke.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Different types of hemiparesis can impair different bodily functions.  Some effects, such as weakness or partial paralysis of a limb on the affected side, are generally always to be expected."
Inflammatory Hepatic Pseudotumor,"Fatigue, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, weight loss, general discomfort","Liver tumors (also known as hepatic tumors) are abnormal growth of liver cells on or in the liver. Several distinct types of tumors can develop in the liver because the liver is made up of various cell types. Liver tumors can be classified as benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) growths. They may be discovered on medical imaging (even for a different reason than the cancer itself), and the diagnosis is often confirmed with liver biopsy. Signs and symptoms of liver masses vary from being asymptomatic to patients presenting with an abdominal mass, hepatomegaly, abdominal pain, jaundice, or some other liver dysfunction."
Listeriosis,"Sepsis, back pain, low-grade fever, disorientation, toxemia, nausea, peritonitis, abdominal pain","Listeriosis is a bacterial infection most commonly caused by Listeria monocytogenes, although L. ivanovii and L. grayi have been reported in certain cases. Listeriosis can cause severe illness, including severe sepsis, meningitis, or encephalitis, sometimes resulting in lifelong harm and even death. Those at risk of severe illness are the elderly, fetuses, newborns, and those who are immunocompromised. In pregnant women, it may cause stillbirth or spontaneous abortion, and preterm birth is common. Listeriosis may cause mild, self-limiting gastroenteritis and fever in anyone."
Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome,"Vomiting, loss of appetite, weight loss, bloating, colic, malnutrition, anemia, abdominal pain","Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome is a gastro-vascular disorder in which the third and final portion of the duodenum is compressed between the abdominal aorta (AA) and the overlying superior mesenteric artery.  This rare, potentially life-threatening syndrome is typically caused by an angle of 625 between the AA and the SMA, in comparison to the normal range of 3856, due to a lack of retroperitoneal and visceral fat (mesenteric fat). In addition, the aortomesenteric distance is 28 millimeters, as opposed to the typical 1020. However, a narrow SMA angle alone is not enough to make a diagnosis, because patients with a low BMI, most notably children, have been known to have a narrow SMA angle with no symptoms of SMA syndrome.
SMA syndrome is also known as Wilkie's syndrome, cast syndrome, mesenteric root syndrome, chronic duodenal ileus and intermittent arterio-mesenteric occlusion."
Amniotic Fluid Embolism,"Shock, uterine bleeding, disseminated intravascular coagulation, dyspnea, cyanosis","An amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is a life-threatening childbirth (obstetric) emergency in which amniotic fluid enters the blood stream of the mother, triggering a serious reaction which results in cardiorespiratory (heart and lung) collapse and massive bleeding (coagulopathy). The rate at which it occurs is 1 instance per 20,000 births and it comprises 10% of all maternal deaths.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Amniotic fluid embolism is suspected when a woman giving birth experiences very sudden insufficient oxygen to body tissues, low blood pressure, and profuse bleeding due to defects in blood coagulation.
The signs and symptoms of amniotic fluid embolism can vary from one individual to another but involve systemic involvement of multiple organ systems. Often, a patient may present with a cough due to the release of bradykinin, an inflammatory marker released during times of pain and which causes an anaphylactoid reaction."
Bladder Sarcoma Botryoides,"Difficulty in urination, urinary retention, hematuria, dysuria, urinary frequency, palpable mass in lower abdomen, possible symptoms of anemia","Sarcoma botryoides or botryoid sarcoma is a subtype of embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, that can be observed in the walls of hollow, mucosa lined structures such as the nasopharynx, common bile duct, urinary bladder of infants and young children or the vagina in females, typically younger than age 8. The name comes from Ancient Greek  botryoid 'grape bunch' due to their gross appearance.


== Presentation ==
For botryoid rhabdomyosarcoma of the vagina, the most common clinical finding is vaginal bleeding but vaginal bleeding is not specific for sarcoma botryoides:  other vaginal cancers are possible. They may appear as a polypoid mass, somewhat yellow in color and are friable: thus, they (possibly) may break off, leading to vaginal bleeding or infections.


== Histology ==
Under the microscope one can see rhabdomyoblasts that may contain cross-striations."
Thalassemia,"Jaundice, anemia, pale complexion, and poor development","Thalassemias are a group of inherited blood disorders that manifest as the production of reduced hemoglobin. Symptoms depend on the type of thalassemia and can vary from none to severe, including death. Often there is mild to severe anemia (low red blood cells or hemoglobin) as thalassemia can affect the production of red blood cells and also affect how long the red blood cells live. Symptoms include tiredness, pallor, bone problems, an enlarged spleen, jaundice, pulmonary hypertension, and dark urine. Children's' growth and development may be slower than normal."
Elderly Viral Hepatitis,"Tendency to bleed, pale stools, elevated bilirubin, gallstones, low fever, liver palms, nausea, fatigue","Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver tissue. Some people or animals with hepatitis have no symptoms, whereas others develop yellow discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), poor appetite, vomiting, tiredness, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hepatitis is acute if it resolves within six months, and chronic if it lasts longer than six months. Acute hepatitis can resolve on its own, progress to chronic hepatitis, or (rarely) result in acute liver failure. Chronic hepatitis may progress to scarring of the liver (cirrhosis), liver failure, and liver cancer."
Accelerated Atrial Ectopic Rhythm,"Tachycardia, chest tightness, palpitations, prolonged Q-T interval, increased heart rate after meals, accelerated atrial ectopic rhythm, irregular heartbeat, arrhythmia","Atrial tachycardia is a type of heart rhythm problem in which the heart's electrical impulse comes from an ectopic pacemaker (that is, an abnormally located cardiac pacemaker) in the upper chambers (atria) of the heart, rather than from the sinoatrial node, the normal origin of the heart's electrical activity.
As with any other form of tachycardia (rapid heart beat), the underlying mechanism can be either the rapid discharge of an abnormal focus, the presence of a ring of cardiac tissue that gives rise to a circle movement (reentry), or a triggered rapid rhythm due to other pathological circumstances (as would be the case with some drug toxicities, such as digoxin toxicity).


== Classification ==
Forms of atrial tachycardia (ATach) include multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT), focal atrial tachycardia and atrial flutter. Paroxysmal atrial tachycardia (PAT) is an episode of arrhythmia that begins and ends abruptly.


== Etiology ==
Atrial tachycardia tends to occur in individuals with structural heart disease, with or without heart failure, and ischemic coronary artery disease."
Liposarcoma,"Pain in the liver area, fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, jaundice","Liposarcomas are the most common subtype of soft tissue sarcomas, accounting for at least 20% of all sarcomas in adults. Soft tissue sarcomas are rare neoplasms with over 150 different histological subtypes or forms. Liposarcomas arise from the precursor lipoblasts of the adipocytes (i.e. fat cells) in adipose (i.e. fat) tissues."
Pediatric Cranial Trauma,"Absence of crying post-birth, pallor, reduced limb activity, rapid or irregular breathing, often delayed consciousness disorders, somnolence, coma","A head injury is any injury that results in trauma to the skull or brain. The terms traumatic brain injury and head injury are often used interchangeably in the medical literature. Because head injuries cover such a broad scope of injuries, there are many causesincluding accidents, falls, physical assault, or traffic accidentsthat can cause head injuries.
The number of new cases is 1.7 million in the United States each year, with about 3% of these incidents leading to death. Adults have head injuries more frequently than any age group resulting from falls, motor vehicle crashes, colliding or being struck by an object, or assaults."
Small Intestinal Colic,"Pale complexion, nausea, cold sweat, borborygmus","Colic in horses is defined as abdominal pain, but it is a clinical symptom rather than a diagnosis. The term colic can encompass all forms of gastrointestinal conditions which cause pain as well as other causes of abdominal pain not involving the gastrointestinal tract. What makes it tricky is that different causes can manifest with similar signs of distress in the animal. Recognizing and understanding these signs is pivotal, as timely action can spell the difference between a brief moment of discomfort and a life-threatening situation. The most common forms of colic are gastrointestinal in nature and are most often related to colonic disturbance."
Nickel Dermatitis,"Papules, maculopapular rash, generalized erythematous patches, vesicles, pruritus","Contact dermatitis is a type of acute or chronic inflammation of the skin caused by exposure to chemical or physical agents. Symptoms of contact dermatitis can include itchy or dry skin, a red rash, bumps, blisters, or swelling. These rashes are not contagious or life-threatening, but can be very uncomfortable.
Contact dermatitis results from either exposure to allergens (allergic contact dermatitis), or irritants (irritant contact dermatitis). Allergic contact dermatitis involves a delayed type of hypersensitivity and previous exposure to an allergen to produce a reaction."
Acute Renal Failure,"Increased blood pressure, dizziness, headache, anemia, oliguria, edema","Acute kidney injury (AKI), previously called acute renal failure (ARF), is a sudden decrease in kidney function that develops within seven days, as shown by an increase in serum creatinine or a decrease in urine output, or both.
Causes of AKI are classified as either prerenal (due to decreased blood flow to the kidney), intrinsic renal (due to damage to the kidney itself), or postrenal (due to blockage of urine flow). Prerenal causes of AKI include sepsis, dehydration, excessive blood loss, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, cirrhosis, and certain medications like ACE inhibitors or NSAIDs. Intrinsic renal causes of AKI include glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, certain antibiotics, and chemotherapeutic agents. Postrenal causes of AKI include kidney stones, bladder cancer, neurogenic bladder, enlargement of the prostate, narrowing of the urethra, and certain medications like anticholinergics."
Extraosseous Ewing's Sarcoma,"Fever, body ache","Ewing sarcoma is a type of pediatric cancer that forms in bone or soft tissue. Symptoms may include swelling and pain at the site of the tumor, fever, and a bone fracture. The most common areas where it begins are the legs, pelvis, and chest wall. In about 25% of cases, the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis. Complications may include a pleural effusion or paraplegia."
Lobomycosis,"Crusting, nodules, lymphadenopathy","Lobomycosis is a fungal infection of the skin. It usually presents with bumps in the skin, firm swellings, deep skin lesions, or malignant tumors.
It is caused by Lacazia loboi (formerly named Loboa loboi). Transmission is generally by direct contact with contaminated water, soil, vegetation, or by direct contact with an infected dolphin.
Diagnosis is by identifying Lacazia laboi in a lesion."
Lymphedema,"Erysipelas, nausea, high fever, chills, secondary infection, varicose veins, venous thrombosis, ulcers","Lymphedema, also known as lymphoedema and lymphatic edema, is a condition of localized swelling caused by a compromised lymphatic system. The lymphatic system functions as a critical portion of the body's immune system and returns interstitial fluid to the bloodstream.
Lymphedema is most frequently a complication of cancer treatment or parasitic infections, but it can also be seen in a number of genetic disorders. Tissues with lymphedema are at high risk of infection because the lymphatic system has been compromised.
Though incurable and progressive, a number of treatments may improve symptoms."
Gastrointestinal Cancer Metastasis to Ovaries,"Abdominal distension, abdominal pain, increased vaginal discharge, vaginal bleeding, pelvic mass, ascites, gastrointestinal symptoms","Ovarian cancer is a cancerous tumor of an ovary. It may originate from the ovary itself or more commonly from communicating nearby structures such as fallopian tubes or the inner lining of the abdomen. The ovary is made up of three different cell types including epithelial cells, germ cells, and stromal cells. When these cells become abnormal, they have the ability to divide and form tumors. These cells can also invade or spread to other parts of the body."
Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome,"Seizures, rapid breathing, difficulty breathing, macroglossia (enlarged tongue), weakness, nystagmus (involuntary eye movement), umbilical hernia, birth weight and length exceeding the normal standards","BeckwithWiedemann syndrome (; abbreviated BWS) is an overgrowth disorder usually present at birth, characterized by an increased risk of childhood cancer and certain congenital features. A minority (<15%) of cases of BWS are familial, meaning that a close relative may also have BWS, and parents of an affected child may be at increased risk of having other children with BWS. While children with BWS are at increased risk of childhood cancer, most children with BWS do not develop cancer and the vast majority of children who do develop cancer can be treated successfully.


== Presentation ==

No consensus clinical diagnostic criteria for BeckwithWiedemann syndrome (BWS) exist. BeckwithWiedemann syndrome (BWS) should be suspected in individuals who have one or more of the following major and/or minor findings.
Major findings associated with BWS

Macrosomia (traditionally defined as weight and length/height >97th centile)
Macroglossia
Hemihyperplasia (asymmetric overgrowth of one or more regions of the body)
Omphalocele (also called exomphalos) or umbilical hernia
Embryonal tumor (e.g., Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma) in childhood
Visceromegaly involving one or more intra-abdominal organs including liver, spleen, kidneys, adrenal glands, and/or pancreas
Cytomegaly of the fetal adrenal cortex (pathognomonic)
Renal abnormalities including structural abnormalities, nephromegaly, nephrocalcinosis, and/or later development of medullary sponge kidney
Anterior linear ear lobe creases and/or posterior helical ear pits
Placental mesenchymal dysplasia
Cleft palate (rare in BWS)
Cardiomyopathy (rare in BWS)
Positive family history (1 family members with a clinical diagnosis of BWS or a history or features suggestive of BWS)
Congenital hyperinsulinism
Minor findings associated with BWS

Pregnancy-related findings including polyhydramnios and prematurity in fetuses with the condition."
Horseshoe Kidney,"Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, difficulty in urinating","Horseshoe kidney, also known as ren arcuatus  (in Latin), renal fusion or super kidney, is a congenital disorder affecting about 1 in 500 people that is more common in men, often asymptomatic, and usually diagnosed incidentally. In this disorder, the patient's kidneys fuse to form a horseshoe-shape during development in the womb. The fused part is the isthmus of the horseshoe kidney. The abnormal anatomy can affect kidney drainage resulting in increased frequency of kidney stones and urinary tract infections as well as increase risk of certain renal cancers.
Fusion abnormalities of the kidney can be categorized into two groups: horseshoe kidney and crossed fused ectopia."
Scrotal Gangrene,"Chills, severe pain, scrotal swelling, heavy scrotal pain, moist scrotum with an abnormal odor, high fever, constipation, red urine","Scrotal inflation or scrotal infusion is a sexual practice in which fluid (typically saline solution, but sometimes air or another gas) is injected into the scrotum in order to make it balloon in size. It carries a number of risks of serious complications, including scrotal cellulitis and subcutaneous emphysema, and possibly fatal complications such as Fournier's gangrene or air embolism."
Psychological Stress,"A common state of psychological tension, which can occur even in the strongest individuals.","In psychology, stress is a feeling of emotional strain and pressure. Stress is a form of psychological and mental discomfort. Small amounts of stress may be beneficial, as it can improve athletic performance, motivation and reaction to the environment. Excessive amounts of stress, however, can increase the risk of strokes, heart attacks, ulcers, and mental illnesses such as depression and also aggravate pre-existing conditions.
Psychological stress can be external and related to the environment, but may also be caused by internal perceptions that cause an individual to experience anxiety or other negative emotions surrounding a situation, such as pressure, discomfort, etc., which they then deem stressful."
Olfactory Neuroblastoma,"Headache, loss of smell, ataxic gait, seizures","Neuroblastoma (NB) is a type of cancer that forms in certain types of nerve tissue. It most frequently starts from one of the adrenal glands but can also develop in the head, neck, chest, abdomen, or spine. Symptoms may include bone pain, a lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest, or a painless bluish lump under the skin.
Typically, neuroblastoma occurs due to a genetic mutation occurring in the first trimester of pregnancy. Rarely, it may be due to a mutation inherited."
Barrett's Esophagus,"symptoms of esophageal reflux, gastroesophageal reflux symptoms, heartburn, dysphagia, burning pain behind the sternum, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting","Barrett's esophagus is a condition in which there is an abnormal (metaplastic) change in the mucosal cells that line the lower part of the esophagus. The cells change from stratified squamous epithelium to simple columnar epithelium, interspersed with goblet cells that are normally only found in the small intestine and large intestine. This change is considered to be a premalignant condition because of its potential to transition into esophageal adenocarcinoma, an often-deadly cancer.
The main cause of Barrett's esophagus is tissue adaptation to chronic acid exposure caused by reflux from the stomach. Barrett's esophagus is diagnosed by endoscopy to visually observe the lower esophagus, followed by a biopsy of the affected area and microscopic examination of that tissue."
Intracranial Germ Cell Tumor,"Increased intracranial pressure, headache, nausea and vomiting, diplopia, papilledema, upward gaze palsy, Arousal pupil, ataxia, nystagmus, precocious puberty, halted sexual development","A germ cell tumor (GCT) is a neoplasm derived from primordial germ cells. Germ-cell tumors can be cancerous or benign. Germ cell tumors typically originate from  the gonads (ovary and testis), but can arise in other areas of the body. Extragonadal GCTs are thought to result from abnormal migration of germ cell precursors during development of the embryo.


== Classification ==

GCTs are classified by their histology, regardless of location in the body."
Metastatic Brain Tumor,"Tinnitus accompanied by severe hearing loss, severe cases may have dizziness, unstable gait, etc.","A brain tumor (sometimes referred more commonly as brain cancer) occurs when a group of cells within the brain turn cancerous and grow out of control, creating a mass. There are two main types of tumors: malignant (cancerous) tumors and benign (non-cancerous) tumors. These can be further classified as primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which most commonly have spread from tumors located outside the brain, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the size of the tumor and the part of the brain that is involved. Where symptoms exist, they may include headaches, seizures, problems with vision, vomiting and mental changes."
Vaccination Complications,"Ulcers, pustules, eczema, pyoderma, high fever, vesicles, maculopapular rash, papules","A COVID19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19).
Knowledge about the structure and function of previous coronaviruses causing diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) accelerated the development of various vaccine platforms in early 2020. In 2020, the first COVID19 vaccines were developed and made available to the public through emergency authorizations and conditional approvals. However, immunity from the vaccines wanes over time, requiring people to get booster doses of the vaccine to maintain protection against COVID19.
The COVID19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the spread of COVID19 and reducing the severity and death caused by COVID19."
Acute Foramen Magnum Herniation,"Headache, nausea, vomiting, disturbance of consciousness","Brain herniation is a potentially deadly side effect of very high pressure within the skull that occurs when a part of the brain is squeezed across structures within the skull. The brain can shift across such structures as the falx cerebri, the tentorium cerebelli, and even through the foramen magnum (the hole in the base of the skull through which the spinal cord connects with the brain).  Herniation can be caused by a number of factors that cause a mass effect and increase intracranial pressure (ICP): these include traumatic brain injury, intracranial hemorrhage, or brain tumor.
Herniation can also occur in the absence of high ICP when mass lesions such as hematomas occur at the borders of brain compartments. In such cases local pressure is increased at the place where the herniation occurs, but this pressure is not transmitted to the rest of the brain, and therefore does not register as an increase in ICP.
Because herniation puts extreme pressure on parts of the brain and thereby cuts off the blood supply to various parts of the brain, it is often fatal."
Chondromyxoid fibroma,"Mild pain, swelling, limited mobility, and possibly local non-painful swelling","Fibromas are benign tumors that are composed of fibrous or connective tissue. They can grow in all organs, arising from mesenchyme  tissue. The term ""fibroblastic"" or ""fibromatous"" is used to describe tumors of the fibrous connective tissue. When the term fibroma is used without modifier, it is usually considered benign, with the term fibrosarcoma reserved for malignant tumors.


== Types ==


=== Hard fibroma ===
The hard fibroma (fibroma durum) consists of many fibres and few cells, e.g."
Cerebral Infarction,"Unsteady gait, urinary and fecal incontinence, localization signs, arteriosclerosis, abducens nerve palsy, lenticulostriate artery occlusion, nausea, diplopia","Cerebral infarction, also known as an ischemic stroke, is the pathologic process that results in an area of necrotic tissue in the brain (cerebral infarct).  In mid to high income countries, a stroke is the main reason for disability among people and the 2nd cause of death. It is caused by disrupted blood supply (ischemia) and restricted oxygen supply (hypoxia). This is most commonly due to a thrombotic occlusion, or an embolic occlusion of major vessels which leads to a cerebral infarct . In response to ischemia, the brain degenerates by the process of liquefactive necrosis."
Osteoblastoma,"Pain, swelling, scoliosis","Osteoblastoma is an uncommon osteoid tissue-forming primary neoplasm of the bone.
It has clinical and histologic manifestations similar to those of osteoid osteoma; therefore, some consider the two tumors to be variants of the same disease, with osteoblastoma representing a giant osteoid osteoma. However, an aggressive type of osteoblastoma has been recognized, making the relationship less clear.
Although similar to osteoid osteoma, osteoblastoma is larger (between 2 and 6 cm).


== Signs and symptoms ==
Patients with osteoblastoma usually present with pain of several months' duration."
Nail Malnutrition,"Fragility of nails, transverse ridging of the nails, alopecia areata, eczema","Terry's nails is a physical condition in which a person's fingernails or toenails:659 appear white with a characteristic ""ground glass"" appearance without any lunula. The condition is thought to be due to a decrease in vascularity and an increase in connective tissue within the nail bed; the darker shade of the distal portion of the nail fades upon pressure, which differentiates Terry's nails from Lindsay's nails. It frequently occurs in the setting of liver failure, cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, hyperthyroidism, or malnutrition. Eighty percent of patients with severe liver disease have Terry's nails, but they are also found in people with kidney failure, in patients with congestive heart failure and are described as a brown arc near the ends of the nails. The recognition of characteristic nail patterns, such as Terry's nails, may be a helpful herald for early diagnosis of systemic diseases."
Salivary Gland Cancer,"Tumor surface ulceration, pain, difficulty in opening the mouth","Salivary gland tumours, or neoplasms, are tumours that form in the tissues of salivary glands. The salivary glands are classified as major or minor. The major salivary glands consist of the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. The minor salivary glands consist of 800 to 1000 small mucus-secreting glands located throughout the lining of the oral cavity. People with these types of tumours may be asymptomatic."
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli Infection,"Diarrhea, low fever, hematochezia, abdominal pain, hematuria, oliguria, anuria, coma, convulsions, slow speech, abdominal distension, hematemesis, and melena","Escherichia coli O157:H7 is a serotype of the bacterial species Escherichia coli and is one of the Shiga-like toxinproducing types of E. coli. It is a cause of disease, typically foodborne illness, through consumption of contaminated and raw food, including raw milk and undercooked ground beef. Infection with this type of pathogenic bacteria may lead to hemorrhagic diarrhea, and to kidney failure; these have been reported to cause the deaths of children younger than five years of age, of elderly patients, and of patients whose immune systems are otherwise compromised.
Transmission is via the fecaloral route, and most illness has been through distribution of contaminated raw leaf green vegetables, undercooked meat and raw milk.


== Signs and symptoms ==
E. coli O157:H7 infection often causes severe, acute hemorrhagic diarrhea (although nonhemorrhagic diarrhea is also possible) and abdominal cramps."
Tuberculous Meningitis,"Seizures, fever, headache, weakness, restlessness, loss of appetite, constipation, paralysis, dysuria and urinary retention, hypotension, rapid and thin pulse, vomiting","Tuberculous meningitis, also known as TB meningitis or tubercular meningitis, is a specific type of bacterial meningitis caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection of the meningesthe system of membranes which envelop the central nervous system.


== Signs and symptoms ==

Fever and headache are the cardinal features; confusion is a late feature and coma bears a poor prognosis. Meningism is absent in a fifth of patients with TB meningitis.  Patients may also have focal neurological deficits.


== Causes ==
Mycobacterium tuberculosis of the meninges is the cardinal feature and the inflammation is concentrated towards the base of the brain."
Juvenile Glaucoma,"Photophobia, tearing, eyelid spasms, ocular distension, headache","Primary congenital glaucoma is a rare eye condition that is present at birth or develops early in childhood. It occurs due to improper drainage of the eye's fluids, which leads to increased pressure inside the eye, known as intraocular pressure. This elevated pressure can damage the optic nerve which will result in permanent vision loss.  It is also known as pediatric glaucoma or childhood glaucoma, and was previously known as trabeculodysgenesis or goniodysgenesis.


== Types ==
Primary congenital glaucoma is classified into three subtypes:

true congenital glaucoma, which causes signs of increased intraocular pressure within the first month of life,
infantile glaucoma, which presents between one month and three years, and
juvenile glaucoma, which becomes clinically apparent after three years of age and before age 40."
Bowen's Disease,"Leukoplakia, corneal epithelial erosion, corneal burns, presence of bacterial plaque or ulceration on the cornea","Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (cSCC), also known as squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous-cell skin cancer, is one of the three principal types of skin cancer, alongside basal-cell carcinoma and melanoma. cSCC typically presents as a hard lump with a scaly surface, though it may also present as an ulcer. Onset and development often occurs over several months.
Compared to basal cell carcinoma, cSCC  is more likely to spread to distant areas. When confined to the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin, the pre-invasive or in situ form of cSCC is termed Bowen's disease."
Pregnancy Complicated with Acute Pancreatitis,"Abdominal distension, abdominal pain accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fever and jaundice, upper abdominal pain, a sensation of constriction in the upper abdomen and back, and Cullen's sign around the navel","Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is a rare life-threatening complication of pregnancy that occurs in the third trimester or the immediate period after delivery.  It is thought to be caused by a disordered metabolism of fatty acids by mitochondria in the fetus, caused by long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency. This leads to decreased metabolism of long-chain fatty acids by the fetoplacental unit, causing a subsequent rise in hepatotoxic fatty acids in maternal plasma. The condition was previously thought to be universally fatal, but aggressive treatment by stabilizing the mother with intravenous fluids and blood products in anticipation of early delivery has improved prognosis.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (or hepatic lipidosis of pregnancy) usually manifests in the third trimester of pregnancy, but may occur any time in the second half of pregnancy, or the puerperium, the period immediately after delivery."
Right Ventricular Myocardial Infarction,"Jugular venous distension, hepatomegaly, arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, cardiac chest pain, syncope due to cardiac causes, shock, right heart failure, hypotension, enlargement of the left ventricular cavity, palpitations, and shortness of breath",Ventricular fibrillation (V-fib or VF) is an abnormal heart rhythm in which the ventricles of the heart quiver. It is due to disorganized electrical activity. Ventricular fibrillation results in cardiac arrest with loss of consciousness and no pulse. This is followed by sudden cardiac death in the absence of treatment. Ventricular fibrillation is initially found in about 10% of people with cardiac arrest.
Ophthalmic Herpes Zoster,"Skin blisters, pain, decreased vision, headache","Herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO), also known as ophthalmic zoster, is shingles involving the eye or the surrounding area. Common signs include a rash of the forehead with swelling of the eyelid. There may also be eye pain and redness, inflammation of the conjunctiva, cornea or uvea, and sensitivity to light. Fever and tingling of the skin and allodynia near the eye may precede the rash. Complications may include visual impairment, increased pressure within the eye, chronic pain, and stroke."
Cervical Leukoplakia,"Vulvar leukoplakia, cervical erosion, vaginal bleeding, bloody vaginal discharge, squamous metaplasia, cervical edema, vascular atrophic leukoplakia","Oral leukoplakia is a potentially malignant disorder affecting the oral mucosa. It is defined as ""essentially an oral mucosal white/gray lesion that cannot be considered as any other definable lesion."" Oral leukoplakia is a gray patch or plaque that develops in the oral cavity and is strongly associated with smoking. Leukoplakia is a firmly attached white patch on a mucous membrane which is associated with increased risk of cancer. The edges of the lesion are typically abrupt and the lesion changes with time. Advanced forms may develop red patches."
Pediatric Acute Poisoning,"Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting","Iron poisoning typically occurs from ingestion of excess iron that results in acute toxicity. Mild symptoms which occur within hours include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and drowsiness. In more severe cases, symptoms can include tachypnea, low blood pressure, seizures, or coma. If left untreated, acute iron poisoning can lead to multi-organ failure resulting in permanent organ damage or death.
Iron is available over the counter as a single entity supplement in an iron salt form or in combination with vitamin supplements and is commonly used in the treatment of anemias."
Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage,"Stomach pain, vomiting of coffee-ground material, tarry stools, dizziness, palpitations, nausea, thirst, pale complexion","Gastrointestinal bleeding (GI bleed), also called gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIB), is all forms of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the rectum. When there is significant blood loss over a short time, symptoms may include vomiting red blood, vomiting black blood, bloody stool, or black stool. Small amounts of bleeding over a long time may cause iron-deficiency anemia resulting in feeling tired or heart-related chest pain. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, shortness of breath, pale skin, or passing out. Sometimes in those with small amounts of bleeding no symptoms may be present."
Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS),"Increased urination, diarrhea, transient gross hematuria, anemia, headache, arrhythmias, dehydration","Hemolyticuremic syndrome (HUS) is a syndrome characterized by low red blood cells, acute kidney injury (previously called acute renal failure), and low platelets. Initial symptoms typically include bloody diarrhea, fever, vomiting, and weakness. Kidney problems and low platelets then occur as the diarrhea progresses. Children are more commonly affected, but most children recover without permanent damage to their health, although some children may have serious and sometimes life-threatening complications. Adults, especially the elderly, may show a more complicated presentation."
Superficial Thrombophlebitis,"Local venous cord-like hardening, general malaise, and red streaks of superficial veins","Superficial thrombophlebitis is a thrombosis and inflammation of superficial veins presenting as a painful induration (thickening) with erythema, often in a linear or branching configuration with a cordlike appearance.:8267
Superficial thrombophlebitis is due to inflammation and/or thrombosis, and, less commonly, infection of the vein. It is generally a benign, self-limiting disorder; however, it can be complicated by deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and even pulmonary embolism (PE) Migratory superficial thrombophlebitis is known as Trousseau's syndrome, which can be an early sign of cancer.
When it (rarely) occurs on the breast or anterior chest wall it has been called Mondor's disease. It sometimes occurs in the arm or penis.:827 In axilla, this condition is known as axillary web syndrome.


== Eponym ==
Mondor's disease is named after Henri Mondor (18851962), a surgeon in Paris, France who first described the disease in 1939."
Colorectal Neoplasms in the Elderly,"Hematochezia, unexplained fever, decreased immunity, malnutrition","Gastrointestinal cancer refers to malignant conditions of the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and accessory organs of digestion, including the esophagus, stomach, biliary system, pancreas, small intestine, large intestine, rectum and anus. The symptoms relate to the organ affected and can include obstruction (leading to difficulty swallowing or defecating), abnormal bleeding or other associated problems. The diagnosis often requires endoscopy, followed by biopsy of suspicious tissue. The treatment depends on the location of the tumor, as well as the type of cancer cell and whether it has invaded other tissues or spread elsewhere. These factors also determine the prognosis."
Asbestosis,"Pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, pleural thickening, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, cough, chest pain, expectoration, hemoptysis, rales, back pain, sternal pain, mucopurulent sputum","Asbestos ( ass-BES-ts, az-, -toss) is a group of naturally occurring, toxic, carcinogenic and fibrous silicate minerals. There are six types, all of which are composed of long and thin fibrous crystals, each fibre (particulate with length substantially greater than width) being composed of many microscopic ""fibrils"" that can be released into the atmosphere by abrasion and other processes. Inhalation of asbestos fibres can lead to various dangerous lung conditions, including mesothelioma, asbestosis, and lung cancer. As a result of these health effects, asbestos is considered a serious health and safety hazard.
Archaeological studies have found evidence of asbestos being used as far back as the Stone Age to strengthen ceramic pots, but large-scale mining began at the end of the 19th century when manufacturers and builders began using asbestos for its desirable physical properties."
Poliomyelitis (Infantile Paralysis),"Fever, irritability, coughing or nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, headache, muscle pain, atrophy or deformity of limbs, leading to limping or inability to stand","Poliomyelitis ( POH-lee-oh-MY--LY-tiss), commonly shortened to polio, is an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus. Approximately 75% of cases are asymptomatic; mild symptoms which can occur include sore throat and fever; in a proportion of cases more severe symptoms develop such as headache, neck stiffness, and paresthesia. These symptoms usually pass within one or two weeks. A less common symptom is permanent paralysis, and possible death in extreme cases. Years after recovery, post-polio syndrome may occur, with a slow development of muscle weakness similar to what the person had during the initial infection."
Pediatric Cirrhosis,"Poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, diarrhea, wasting, fatigue, ascites","Liver cancer, also known as hepatic cancer, primary hepatic cancer, or primary hepatic malignancy, is cancer that starts in the liver. Liver cancer can be primary in which the cancer starts in the liver, or it can be liver metastasis, or secondary, in which the cancer spreads from elsewhere in the body to the liver. Liver metastasis is the more common of the two liver cancers. Instances of liver cancer are increasing globally. 
Primary liver cancer is globally the sixth-most frequent cancer and the fourth-leading cause of death from cancer."
Neonatal Acute Renal Failure,"Anuria, oliguria, edema, pallor, weight gain, heart failure, polyuria, anorexia, hypertension, hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, metabolic acidosis","Acute kidney injury (AKI), previously called acute renal failure (ARF), is a sudden decrease in kidney function that develops within seven days, as shown by an increase in serum creatinine or a decrease in urine output, or both.
Causes of AKI are classified as either prerenal (due to decreased blood flow to the kidney), intrinsic renal (due to damage to the kidney itself), or postrenal (due to blockage of urine flow). Prerenal causes of AKI include sepsis, dehydration, excessive blood loss, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, cirrhosis, and certain medications like ACE inhibitors or NSAIDs. Intrinsic renal causes of AKI include glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, acute tubular necrosis, certain antibiotics, and chemotherapeutic agents. Postrenal causes of AKI include kidney stones, bladder cancer, neurogenic bladder, enlargement of the prostate, narrowing of the urethra, and certain medications like anticholinergics."
Myelophthisic Anemia,"Anemia, fatigue, dizziness, tinnitus, insomnia, frequent dreams, memory decline, shortness of breath","Myelophthisic anemia (or myelophthisis) is a severe type of anemia found in some people with diseases that affect the bone marrow.  Myelophthisis refers to the displacement of hemopoietic bone-marrow tissue by fibrosis, tumors, or granulomas. The word comes from the roots myelo-, which refers to bone marrow, and phthisis, shrinkage or atrophy.


== Causes ==
Myelophthisis can occur in the setting of chronic myeloproliferative disease (e.g. myelofibrosis), leukemia, lymphoma, and metastatic carcinoma or myeloma."
Desmoid Tumor,Abdominal mass,"Aggressive fibromatosis or desmoid tumor is a rare condition. Desmoid tumors are a type of fibromatosis and related to sarcoma, though without the ability to spread throughout the body (metastasize). The tumors arise from cells called fibroblasts, which are found throughout the body and provide structural support, protection to the vital organs, and play a critical role in wound healing. These tumors tend to occur in women in their thirties, but can occur in anyone at any age. They can be either relatively slow-growing or malignant."
Aortopulmonary Septal Defect,"Palpitations, tachycardia, abnormal breathing, cyanosis, cough, dyspnea, fatigue","Aortopulmonary window (APW) is a faulty connection between the aorta and the main pulmonary artery that results in a significant left-to-right shunt. The aortopulmonary window is the rarest of septal defects, accounting for 0.15-0.6% of all congenital heart malformations. An aortopulmonary window can develop alone or in up to 50% of cases alongside other cardiac defects such as interrupted aortic arch, coarctation of the aorta, transposition of great vessels, and tetralogy of Fallot.


== Signs and symptoms ==
A left-to-right shunt can cause heart failure, with symptoms such as tachypnea, poor eating, and diaphoresis. Dyspnea and indications of laborious breathing can be caused by low lung compliance and increased airway resistance."
Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma,"Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, increased abdominal circumference","Primary peritoneal cancer or carcinoma is also known as serous surface papillary carcinoma, primary peritoneal carcinoma, extra-ovarian serous carcinoma, primary serous papillary carcinoma, and psammomacarcinoma. It was historically classified under ""carcinoma of unknown primary"" (CUP). Primary peritoneal cancer (PPC, or PPCa) is a cancer of the cells lining the peritoneum, or abdominal cavity. It usually affects women and is diagnosed after the age of 60; it very rarely affects men.
Histomorphological and molecular biological characteristics suggest that serous carcinomas, which include ovarian serous carcinoma, uterine serous carcinoma, fallopian tube serous carcinoma, cervical serous carcinoma, and primary peritoneal serous carcinoma really represent one entity."
Cesarean Section,"Irregular contractions, cervical dilation failure, pelvic narrowing","Caesarean section, also known as C-section, cesarean, or caesarean delivery, is the surgical procedure by which one or more babies are delivered through an incision in the mother's abdomen. It is often performed because vaginal delivery would put the mother or child at risk (of paralysis or even death). Reasons for the operation include, but are not limited to, obstructed labor, twin pregnancy, high blood pressure in the mother, breech birth, shoulder presentation, and problems with the placenta or umbilical cord. A caesarean delivery may be performed based upon the shape of the mother's pelvis or history of a previous C-section. A trial of vaginal birth after C-section may be possible."
Chronic Renal Failure in the Elderly,"Anemia, hypertension, seizures and seizure-like episodes, uremia, speech disturbances, muscle fasciculations, hemiplegia, consciousness disturbances, dehydration, water retention, bradycardia, atrioventricular block","Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a type of long-term kidney disease, defined by the sustained presence of abnormal kidney function and/or abnormal kidney structure. To meet criteria for CKD, the abnormalities must be present for at least three months. Early in the course of CKD, patients are usually asymptomatic, but later symptoms may include leg swelling, feeling tired, vomiting, loss of appetite, and confusion. Complications can relate to hormonal dysfunction of the kidneys and include (in chronological order) high blood pressure (often related to activation of the reninangiotensin system), bone disease, and anemia. Additionally CKD patients have markedly increased cardiovascular complications with increased risks of death and hospitalization."
Acute Post-Infectious Glomerulonephritis in the Elderly,"Hematuria, proteinuria, hypertension, edema, decreased glomerular filtration rate, oliguria, anuria, renal involvement, interstitial nephritis, wound infection, urinary frequency with urgency and dysuria, fatigue","Group A streptococcal infections are a number of infections with Streptococcus pyogenes, a group A streptococcus (GAS). S. pyogenes is a species of beta-hemolytic Gram-positive bacteria that is responsible for a wide range of infections that are mostly common and fairly mild. If the bacteria enters the bloodstream, the infection can become severe and life-threatening, and is called an invasive GAS (iGAS).
Infection of GAS may spread through direct contact with mucus or sores on the skin. GAS infections can cause over 500,000 deaths per year."
Alcoholic Liver Disease,"Nail changes to spoon shape, skin aging, jaundice, alcohol craving, darkening of the nose, nausea, vomiting, enlarged and tender liver","Alcoholic liver disease (ALD), also called alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), is a term that encompasses the liver manifestations of alcohol overconsumption, including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and chronic hepatitis with liver fibrosis or cirrhosis.
It is the major cause of liver disease in Western countries, and is the leading cause of death from excessive drinking. Although steatosis (fatty liver disease) will develop in any individual who consumes a large quantity of alcoholic beverages over a long period of time, this process is transient and reversible. More than 90% of all heavy drinkers develop fatty liver whilst about 25% develop the more severe alcoholic hepatitis, and 15% liver cirrhosis.
For patients with chronic hepatitis B, a strict adherence to abstinence is highly recommended."
Intestinal Polyposis,"Diarrhea, mucoid stools, watery stools, hematochezia, abdominal discomfort, weight loss, anemia, polyps, abdominal pain","Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant inherited condition in which numerous adenomatous polyps form mainly in the epithelium of the large intestine. While these polyps start out benign, malignant transformation into colon cancer occurs when they are left untreated. Three variants are known to exist, FAP and attenuated FAP (originally called hereditary flat adenoma syndrome) are caused by APC gene defects on chromosome 5 while autosomal recessive FAP (or MUTYH-associated polyposis) is caused by defects in the MUTYH gene on chromosome 1. Of the three, FAP itself is the most severe and most common; although for all three, the resulting colonic polyps and cancers are initially confined to the colon wall. Detection and removal before metastasis outside the colon can greatly reduce and in many cases eliminate the spread of cancer."
Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT),"Rapid heartbeat, blackouts, dizziness, blurred vision, urinary incontinence and enuresis, palpitations, shortness of breath, syncope, catecholaminergic dependency, interstitial fibrosis, sudden death, ectopic tachycardia","Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited genetic disorder that predisposes those affected to potentially life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms or arrhythmias. The arrhythmias seen in CPVT typically occur during exercise or at times of emotional stress, and classically take the form of bidirectional ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Those affected may be asymptomatic, but they may also experience blackouts or even sudden cardiac death.
CPVT is caused by genetic mutations affecting proteins that regulate the concentrations of calcium within cardiac muscle cells. The most commonly identified gene is RYR2, which encodes a protein included in an ion channel known as the ryanodine receptor; this channel releases calcium from a cell's internal calcium store, the sarcoplasmic reticulum, during every heartbeat."
Chronic atrophic gastritis,"Abdominal distension, abdominal pain, upper abdominal discomfort, early satiety, burping, nausea, indigestion, loss of appetite","Atrophic gastritis  is a process of chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa of the stomach, leading to a loss of gastric glandular cells and their eventual replacement by intestinal and fibrous tissues. As a result, the stomach's secretion of essential substances such as hydrochloric acid, pepsin, and intrinsic factor is impaired, leading to digestive problems. The most common are pernicious anemia possibly leading to vitamin B12 deficiency; and malabsorption of iron, leading to iron deficiency anaemia. It can be caused by persistent infection with Helicobacter pylori, or can be autoimmune in origin. Those with autoimmune atrophic gastritis (Type A gastritis) are statistically more likely to develop gastric carcinoma (a form of stomach cancer), Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and achlorhydria."
Scorpion Sting,"Pain, swelling at the sting site, high fever, nausea and vomiting, fainting","A scorpion sting is an injury caused by the stinger of a scorpion resulting in the medical condition known as scorpionism, which may vary in severity. The anatomical part of the scorpion that delivers the sting is called a ""telson"". In typical cases, scorpion stings usually result in pain, paresthesia, and variable swelling. In serious cases, scorpion stings may involve the envenomation of humans by toxic scorpions, which may result in extreme pain, serious illness, or even death depending on the toxicity of the venom.
Most scorpion stings range in severity from minor swelling to medically significant lesions, with only a few able to cause severe allergic, neurotic or necrotic reactions."
Posterior Urethral Valve in Children,"Poor urination, urinary incontinence, acute urinary retention, dehydration","Posterior urethral valve (PUV) disorder is an obstructive developmental anomaly in the urethra and genitourinary system of male newborns. A posterior urethral valve is an obstructing membrane in the posterior male urethra as a result of abnormal in utero development. It is the most common cause of bladder outlet obstruction in male newborns. The disorder varies in degree, with mild cases presenting late due to milder symptoms. More severe cases can have renal and respiratory failure from lung underdevelopment as result of low amniotic fluid volumes, requiring intensive care and close monitoring."
Cerebral hemorrhage,"Motor and speech disorders, vomiting, disturbance of consciousness, headache, dizziness","Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), also known as hemorrhagic stroke, is a sudden bleeding into the tissues of the brain (i.e. the parenchyma), into its ventricles, or into both. An ICH is a type of bleeding within the skull and one kind of stroke (ischemic stroke being the other). Symptoms can vary dramatically depending on the severity (how much blood), acuity (over what timeframe), and location (anatomically) but can include headache, one-sided weakness, numbness, tingling, or paralysis, speech problems, vision or hearing problems, memory loss, attention problems, coordination problems, balance problems, dizziness or lightheadedness or vertigo, nausea/vomiting, seizures, decreased level of consciousness or total loss of consciousness, neck stiffness, and fever.
Hemorrhagic stroke may occur on the background of alterations to the blood vessels in the brain, such as cerebral arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral arteriovenous malformation, brain trauma, brain tumors and an intracranial aneurysm, which can cause intraparenchymal or subarachnoid hemorrhage."
Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma of Bone,"Swelling and pain in the long bones, bone pain, poor fibrous structure","Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), also termed pleomorphic myofibrosarcoma, high-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma, and high-grade myofibrosarcoma, is characterized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a rare, poorly differentiated neoplasm (i.e., an abnormal growth of cells that have an unclear identity and/or cell of origin). WHO classified it as one of the undifferentiated/unclassified sarcomas in the category of tumors of uncertain differentiation. Sarcomas are cancers derived mesenchymal stem cells that typically develop in bone, muscle, fat, blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, tendons, and ligaments. More than 70 sarcoma subtypes have been described. The UPS subtype of these sarcomas consists of tumor cells that are poorly differentiated and may appear as spindle-shaped cells, histiocytes, and giant cells."
Type II Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy,"Fever, papules, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly","Lymphoma is a group of blood and lymph tumors that develop from lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). The name typically refers to just the cancerous versions rather than all such tumours. Signs and symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, drenching sweats, unintended weight loss, itching, and constantly feeling tired. The enlarged lymph nodes are usually painless. The sweats are most common at night."
Ovarian Gonadoblastoma,"Irregular vaginal bleeding, menstrual disorders, postmenopausal bleeding, amenorrhea, precocious puberty, abdominal pain, heavy menstruation, changes in menstrual cycles, scanty menstruation, pigmentation, polyps","A gonadoblastoma is a complex neoplasm composed of a mixture of gonadal elements, such as large primordial germ cells, immature Sertoli cells or granulosa cells of the sex cord, and gonadal stromal cells. Gonadoblastomas are by definition benign, but more than 50% have a co-existing dysgerminoma which is malignant, and an additional 10% have other more aggressive malignancies, and as such are often treated as malignant.


== Risk factors ==
Gonadoblastoma is most often associated with an abnormal chromosomal karyotype, gonadal dysgenesis, or the presence of a Y chromosome in over 90% of cases. Gonadoblastoma has been found in association with androgen insensitivity syndrome, mixed gonadal dysgenesis and Turner syndrome, especially in the presence of Y chromosome-bearing cells. Women with Turner syndrome whose karyotype includes a Y chromosome (as in 45,X/46,XY mosaicism) are at increased risk for gonadoblastoma."
Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome in Elderly,"Metabolic acidosis, hypoxemia, pulmonary infection, hypercoagulable state, hypercapnia, dyspnea, respiratory failure, jaundice","Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is altered organ function in an acutely ill patient requiring immediate medical intervention.
There are different stages of organ dysfunction for certain different organs, both in acute and in chronic onset, whether or not there are one or more organs affected. Each stage of dysfunction (whether it be the heart, lung, liver, or kidney) has defined parameters, in terms of laboratory values based on blood and other tests, as to what it is (each of these organs' levels of failure is divided into stage I, II, III, IV, and V). The word ""failure"" is commonly used to refer to the later stages, especially IV and V, when artificial support usually becomes necessary to sustain life; the damage may or may not be fully or partially reversible.


== Signs and symptoms ==
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome can trigger a variety of symptoms throughout the body."
Borderline Ovarian Tumor,"No specific symptoms or abdominal discomfort, gastrointestinal symptoms, urinary tract symptoms, acute abdomen",Surface epithelial-stromal tumors are a class of ovarian neoplasms that may be benign or malignant. Neoplasms in this group are thought to be derived from the ovarian surface epithelium (modified peritoneum) or from ectopic endometrial or fallopian tube (tubal) tissue. Tumors of this type are also called ovarian adenocarcinoma. This group of tumors accounts for 90% to 95% of all cases of ovarian cancer; however is mainly only found in postmenopausal women with the exception of the United States where 7% of cases occur in women under the age of 40. Serum CA-125 is often elevated but is only 50% accurate so it is not a useful tumor marker to assess the progress of treatment.
Esophageal Perforation by Foreign Body,"Retrosternal pain, dysphagia, shock","An esophageal food bolus obstruction is a medical emergency caused by the obstruction of the esophagus by an ingested foreign body.
It is usually associated with diseases that may narrow the lumen of the esophagus, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, Schatzki rings, peptic strictures, webs, or cancers of the esophagus; rarely it can be seen in disorders of the movement of the esophagus, such as nutcracker esophagus.
While some esophageal food boli can pass by themselves or with the assistance of medications, some require the use of endoscopy to push the obstructing food into the stomach, or remove it from the esophagus. The use of glucagon, while common, has not been found to be useful.
Eponymous names include 'the steakhouse syndrome' and 'backyard barbeque syndrome'."
Infective Endocarditis-Related Kidney Damage,"Hematuria, proteinuria, fever, malaise, tachypulse, bradycardia, heart failure, chronic kidney failure, back pain, high fever with chills, infective vegetations, palpitations","Infective endocarditis is an infection of the inner surface of the heart (endocardium), usually the valves. Signs and symptoms may include fever, small areas of bleeding into the skin, heart murmur, feeling tired, and low red blood cell count. Complications may include backward blood flow in the heart, heart failure  the heart struggling to pump a sufficient amount of blood to meet the body's needs, abnormal electrical conduction in the heart, stroke, and kidney failure.
The cause is typically a bacterial infection and less commonly a fungal infection. Risk factors include valvular heart disease, including rheumatic disease, congenital heart disease, artificial valves, hemodialysis, intravenous drug use, and electronic pacemakers."
Head Trauma,"Localized bleeding, pain, dizziness, headache","A head injury is any injury that results in trauma to the skull or brain. The terms traumatic brain injury and head injury are often used interchangeably in the medical literature. Because head injuries cover such a broad scope of injuries, there are many causesincluding accidents, falls, physical assault, or traffic accidentsthat can cause head injuries.
The number of new cases is 1.7 million in the United States each year, with about 3% of these incidents leading to death. Adults have head injuries more frequently than any age group resulting from falls, motor vehicle crashes, colliding or being struck by an object, or assaults."
Abdominal aortic aneurysm,"Abdominal aortic aneurysms often grow slowly without noticeable symptoms. This makes them difficult to detect. Some aneurysms never rupture. Many start small and stay small. Others grow larger over time, sometimes quickly. If you have a growing abdominal aortic aneurysm, you might notice: If you have pain, especially if pain is sudden and severe, seek medical help right away. Aneurysms can develop anywhere along the aorta. Most aortic aneurysms occur in the part of the aorta that's in the belly area, called the abdomen. Several things can lead to the development of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, including: Abdominal aortic aneurysm risk factors include: If you're at risk of an aortic aneurysm, medicines may be given to lower your blood pressure and relieve stress on weakened arteries. Complications of abdominal aortic aneurysms include: A rupture can cause life-threatening internal bleeding. In general, the larger the aneurysm and the faster it grows, the greater the risk of rupture. Symptoms that an aortic aneurysm has ruptured can include: Aortic aneurysms also increase the risk of developing blood clots in the area. If a blood clot breaks loose from the inside wall of an aneurysm, it can block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body. Symptoms of a blocked blood vessel may include pain or reduced blood flow to the legs, toes, kidneys or belly area. To prevent an abdominal aortic aneurysm or to keep one from worsening, do the following: ","An abdominal aortic aneurysm is an enlarged area in the lower part of the body's main artery, called the aorta. The aorta runs from the heart through the center of the chest and belly area, called the abdomen. The aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body. An abdominal aortic aneurysm that ruptures can cause life-threatening bleeding. Treatment depends on the size of the aneurysm and how fast it's growing. Treatment varies from regular health checkups and imaging tests to emergency surgery. Abdominal aortic aneurysms often grow slowly without noticeable symptoms. This makes them difficult to detect.

Acanthosis nigricans,"The main sign of acanthosis nigricans is dark, thick, velvety skin in body folds and creases. It often appears in the armpits, groin and back of the neck. It develops slowly. The affected skin might be itchy, have an odor and develop skin tags.
Consult your health care provider if you notice changes in your skin — especially if the changes are sudden. You may have an underlying condition that needs treatment.","Acanthosis nigricans is a condition that causes areas of dark, thick velvety skin in body folds and creases. It typically affects the armpits, groin and neck.
Acanthosis nigricans (ak-an-THOE-sis NIE-grih-kuns) tends to affect people with obesity. Rarely, the skin condition can be a sign of cancer in an internal organ, such as the stomach or liver.
Treating the cause of acanthosis nigricans might restore the usual color and texture of the skin.
Acanthosis nigricans is a skin condition that causes a dark discoloration in body folds and creases. It typically affects the armpits, groin and neck."
Acoustic neuroma,"Symptoms of an acoustic neuroma are often easy to miss and may take years to develop. Symptoms may occur because of the tumor's effects on the hearing and balance nerves. The tumor also can put pressure on nearby nerves controlling facial muscles, known as the facial nerve, and sensation, known as the trigeminal nerve. Blood vessels or brain structures also can be affected by an acoustic neuroma. As the tumor grows, it may be more likely to cause more noticeable or worse symptoms. Common symptoms of an acoustic neuroma include: Rarely, an acoustic neuroma may grow large enough to compress the brainstem and become life-threatening. See a health care professional if you notice hearing loss in one ear, ringing in your ear or balance problems. Early diagnosis of an acoustic neuroma may help keep the tumor from growing large enough to cause complications such as total hearing loss. The cause of acoustic neuromas can sometimes be linked to a problem with a gene on chromosome 22. Typically, this gene produces a tumor suppressor protein that helps control the growth of Schwann cells covering the nerves. Experts don't know what causes this problem with the gene. Often there is no known cause for an acoustic neuroma. This gene change is inherited in people with a rare disorder called neurofibromatosis type 2. People with neurofibromatosis type 2 usually have growth of tumors on the hearing and balance nerves on both sides of the head. These tumors are known as bilateral vestibular schwannomas. The only confirmed risk factor for acoustic neuromas is having a parent with the rare genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type 2. However, neurofibromatosis type 2 only accounts for about 5% of acoustic neuroma cases. A hallmark characteristic of neurofibromatosis type 2 is noncancerous tumors on the balance nerves on both sides of the head. Tumors also may develop on other nerves. Neurofibromatosis type 2 is known as an autosomal dominant disorder. This means that the gene related to the disorder can be passed to a child by just one parent. Each child of an affected parent has a 50-50 chance of inheriting it. An acoustic neuroma may cause permanent complications, including: Large tumors may press on the brainstem, occasionally preventing the flow of cerebrospinal fluid between the brain and spinal cord. Fluid can build up in your head, a condition known as hydrocephalus. This increases the pressure inside the skull. ","An acoustic neuroma is a noncancerous tumor that develops on the main nerve leading from the inner ear to the brain. This nerve is called the vestibular nerve. Branches of the nerve directly affect balance and hearing. Pressure from an acoustic neuroma can cause hearing loss, ringing in the ear and problems with balance. Another name for an acoustic neuroma is vestibular schwannoma. An acoustic neuroma develops from the Schwann cells covering the vestibular nerve. An acoustic neuroma is usually slow-growing. Rarely, it may grow quickly and become large enough to press against the brain and affect vital functions. Treatments for an acoustic neuroma include monitoring, radiation and surgical removal. Symptoms of an acoustic neuroma are often easy to miss and may take years to develop. Symptoms may occur because of the tumor's effects on the hearing and balance nerves.

Acromegaly,"A common sign of acromegaly is enlarged hands and feet. For example, you may notice that you aren't able to put on rings that used to fit, and that your shoe size has progressively increased. Acromegaly may also cause gradual changes in your face's shape, such as a protruding lower jaw and brow bone, an enlarged nose, thickened lips, and wider spacing between your teeth. Because acromegaly tends to progress slowly, early signs may not be obvious for years. Sometimes, people notice the physical changes only by comparing old photos with newer ones. Overall, acromegaly signs and symptoms tend to vary from one person to another, and may include any of the following: If you have signs and symptoms associated with acromegaly, contact your doctor for an exam. Acromegaly usually develops slowly. Even your family members may not notice the gradual physical changes that occur with this disorder at first. But early diagnosis is important so that you can start getting proper care. Acromegaly can lead to serious health problems if it's not treated. Acromegaly occurs when the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone (GH) over a long period of time. The pituitary gland is a small gland at the base of your brain, behind the bridge of your nose. It producesGHand a number of other hormones.GHplays an important role in managing your physical growth. When the pituitary gland releasesGHinto your bloodstream, it triggers your liver to produce a hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) — sometimes also called insulin-like growth factor-I, or IGF-I.IGF-1is what causes your bones and other tissues to grow. Too muchGHleads to too muchIGF-1, which can cause acromegaly signs, symptoms and complications. In adults, a tumor is the most common cause of too muchGHproduction: People who have a rare genetic condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1), have a higher risk of developing acromegaly. InMEN 1, the endocrine glands — usually the parathyroid glands, pancreas and pituitary gland — grow tumors and release extra hormones. Those hormones may trigger acromegaly. If left untreated, acromegaly can lead to major health problems. Complications may include: Early treatment of acromegaly can prevent these complications from developing or becoming worse. Untreated, acromegaly and its complications can lead to premature death. ","Acromegaly is a hormonal disorder that develops when your pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone during adulthood. When you have too much growth hormone, your bones increase in size. In childhood, this leads to increased height and is called gigantism. But in adulthood, a change in height doesn't occur. Instead, the increase in bone size is limited to the bones of your hands, feet and face, and is called acromegaly. Because acromegaly is uncommon and the physical changes occur slowly over many years, the condition sometimes takes a long time to recognize. Untreated, high levels of growth hormone can affect other parts of the body, in addition to your bones. This can lead to serious — sometimes even life-threatening — health problems. But treatment can reduce your risk of complications and significantly improve your symptoms, including the enlargement of your features. A common sign of acromegaly is enlarged hands and feet. For example, you may notice that you aren't able to put on rings that used to fit, and that your shoe size has progressively increased.

Actinic keratosis,"Actinic keratoses vary in appearance. Symptoms include:
It can be difficult to distinguish between noncancerous spots and cancerous ones. So it's best to have new skin changes evaluated by a health care provider — especially if a scaly spot or patch persists, grows or bleeds.","An actinic keratosis (ak-TIN-ik ker-uh-TOE-sis) is a rough, scaly patch on the skin that develops from years of sun exposure. It's often found on the face, lips, ears, forearms, scalp, neck or back of the hands.
Actinic keratoses are scaly spots or patches on the top layer of skin. With time they may become hard with a wartlike surface.
Also known as a solar keratosis, an actinic keratosis grows slowly and usually first appears in people over 40. You can reduce your risk of this skin condition by minimizing your sun exposure and protecting your skin from ultraviolet (UV) rays.
Left untreated, the risk of actinic keratoses turning into a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma is about 5% to 10%."
Acute coronary syndrome,"The symptoms of acute coronary syndrome usually begin suddenly. They include: Chest pain or discomfort is the most common symptom. But symptoms may vary quite a bit depending on your age, sex and other medical conditions. You're more likely to have symptoms without chest pain or discomfort if you're a woman, an older adult or have diabetes. Acute coronary syndrome is a medical emergency. Chest pain or discomfort can be a symptom of many life-threatening conditions. Get emergency help for a diagnosis and appropriate care right away. Do not drive yourself to the hospital. Acute coronary syndrome usually results from the buildup of fatty deposits on the walls of blood vessels that deliver blood, oxygen and nutrients to heart muscles. Fatty deposits also are called plaque. The blood vessels that supply the heart also are known as coronary arteries. When a fatty deposit ruptures or splits, a blood clot forms. This clot blocks the flow of blood to heart muscles. When the supply of oxygen to cells is too low, cells in the heart muscles can die. The death of cells results in damage to muscle tissues. This is called a heart attack. Even when there is no cell death, the drop in oxygen still results in heart muscles that don't work the way they should. This change may be short-lived or permanent. When acute coronary syndrome doesn't result in cell death, it is called unstable angina. The risk factors for acute coronary syndrome are the same as those for other types of heart disease. Risk factors include: ","Acute coronary syndrome is a term that describes a range of conditions related to sudden, reduced blood flow to the heart. These conditions include a heart attack and unstable angina. A heart attack happens when cell death damages or destroys heart tissue. A heart attack also is known as a myocardial infarction. Unstable angina occurs when blood flow to the heart decreases. It's not severe enough to cause cell death or a heart attack. But the reduced blood flow may increase your risk of a heart attack. Acute coronary syndrome often causes severe chest pain or discomfort. It is a medical emergency that needs a diagnosis and care right away. The goals of treatment include improving blood flow, treating complications and preventing future problems. The symptoms of acute coronary syndrome usually begin suddenly.

Acute lymphocytic leukemia,"Signs and symptoms of acute lymphocytic leukemia may include: Make an appointment with your doctor or your child's doctor if you notice any persistent signs and symptoms that concern you. Many signs and symptoms of acute lymphocytic leukemia mimic those of the flu. However, flu signs and symptoms eventually improve. If signs and symptoms don't improve as expected, make an appointment with your doctor. Acute lymphocytic leukemia occurs when a bone marrow cell develops changes (mutations) in its genetic material or DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. Normally, the DNA tells the cell to grow at a set rate and to die at a set time. In acute lymphocytic leukemia, the mutations tell the bone marrow cell to continue growing and dividing. When this happens, blood cell production becomes out of control. The bone marrow produces immature cells that develop into leukemic white blood cells called lymphoblasts. These abnormal cells are unable to function properly, and they can build up and crowd out healthy cells. It's not clear what causes the DNA mutations that can lead to acute lymphocytic leukemia. Factors that may increase the risk of acute lymphocytic leukemia include: ","Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow — the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made. The word ""acute"" in acute lymphocytic leukemia comes from the fact that the disease progresses rapidly and creates immature blood cells, rather than mature ones. The word ""lymphocytic"" in acute lymphocytic leukemia refers to the white blood cells called lymphocytes, whichALLaffects. Acute lymphocytic leukemia is also known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Acute lymphocytic leukemia is the most common type of cancer in children, and treatments result in a good chance for a cure. Acute lymphocytic leukemia can also occur in adults, though the chance of a cure is greatly reduced.

Acute myelogenous leukemia,"Symptoms of acute myelogenous leukemia may include: Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you have ongoing symptoms that worry you. Acute myelogenous leukemia symptoms are like those of many more-common conditions, such as infections. The healthcare professional may check for those causes first. It's often not clear what causes acute myelogenous leukemia. Healthcare professionals know that it starts when something causes changes to the DNA inside cells in the bone marrow. The bone marrow is the spongy material inside bones. It's where blood cells are made. The changes that lead to acute myelogenous leukemia are thought to happen in cells called myeloid cells. Myeloid cells are bone marrow cells that can turn into the blood cells that circulate through the body. Healthy myeloid cells can become: Every cell in the body contains DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. But when the DNA changes happen in the myeloid cells, the changes give different instructions. The myeloid cells start to make a lot of extra cells, and they don't stop. The DNA changes cause the myeloid cells to make a lot of immature white blood cells, called myeloblasts. The myeloblasts don't work right. They can build up in the bone marrow. They can crowd out healthy blood cells. Without enough healthy blood cells, there might be low oxygen levels in the blood, easy bruising and bleeding, and frequent infections. Factors that may increase the risk of acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML, include: Many people with AML have no known risk factors, and many people who have risk factors never develop the cancer. ","Acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML, is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft matter inside bones where blood cells are made. The word ""acute"" in acute myelogenous leukemia means the disease tends to get worse quickly. It's called myelogenous (my-uh-LOHJ-uh-nus) leukemia because it affects cells called the myeloid cells. These typically develop into mature blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. The other type is acute lymphoblastic leukemia, also called ALL. Although AML can be diagnosed at any age, it is less common before age 45. AML also is called acute myeloid leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Unlike other cancers, there are no numbered stages of acute myelogenous leukemia. Symptoms of acute myelogenous leukemia may include: Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you have ongoing symptoms that worry you. Acute myelogenous leukemia symptoms are like those of many more-common conditions, such as infections. The healthcare professional may check for those causes first. It's often not clear what causes acute myelogenous leukemia. Healthcare professionals know that it starts when something causes changes to the DNA inside cells in the bone marrow. The bone marrow is the spongy material inside bones. It's where blood cells are made. The changes that lead to acute myelogenous leukemia are thought to happen in cells called myeloid cells. Myeloid cells are bone marrow cells that can turn into the blood cells that circulate through the body. Healthy myeloid cells can become: Every cell in the body contains DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. But when the DNA changes happen in the myeloid cells, the changes give different instructions. The myeloid cells start to make a lot of extra cells, and they don't stop. The DNA changes cause the myeloid cells to make a lot of immature white blood cells, called myeloblasts. The myeloblasts don't work right. They can build up in the bone marrow. They can crowd out healthy blood cells. Without enough healthy blood cells, there might be low oxygen levels in the blood, easy bruising and bleeding, and frequent infections. Factors that may increase the risk of acute myelogenous leukemia, also called AML, include: Many people with AML have no known risk factors, and many people who have risk factors never develop the cancer. "
Adrenal cancer,"Signs and symptoms of adrenal cancer include: It's not clear what causes adrenal cancer. Adrenal cancer forms when something creates changes (mutations) in the DNA of an adrenal gland cell. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutations can tell the cell to multiply uncontrollably and to continue living when healthy cells would die. When this happens, the abnormal cells accumulate and form a tumor. The tumor cells can break away and spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. Adrenal cancer happens more often in people with inherited syndromes that increase the risk of certain cancers. These inherited syndromes include:","Adrenal cancer is a rare cancer that begins in one or both of the small, triangular glands (adrenal glands) located on top of your kidneys. Adrenal glands produce hormones that give instructions to virtually every organ and tissue in your body. Adrenal cancer, also called adrenocortical cancer, can occur at any age. But it's most likely to affect children younger than 5 and adults in their 40s and 50s. When adrenal cancer is found early, there is a chance for cure. But if the cancer has spread to areas beyond the adrenal glands, cure becomes less likely. Treatment can be used to delay progression or recurrence. Most growths that form in the adrenal glands are noncancerous (benign). Benign adrenal tumors, such as adenoma or pheochromocytoma, also can develop in the adrenal glands. Signs and symptoms of adrenal cancer include: It's not clear what causes adrenal cancer. Adrenal cancer forms when something creates changes (mutations) in the DNA of an adrenal gland cell.

Alcohol use disorder,"Alcohol use disorder can be mild, moderate or severe, based on the number of symptoms you experience. Signs and symptoms may include: Alcohol use disorder can include periods of being drunk (alcohol intoxication) and symptoms of withdrawal. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines one standard drink as any one of these: If you feel that you sometimes drink too much alcohol, or your drinking is causing problems, or if your family is concerned about your drinking, talk with your health care provider. Other ways to get help include talking with a mental health professional or seeking help from a support group such as Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar type of self-help group. Because denial is common, you may feel like you don't have a problem with drinking. You might not recognize how much you drink or how many problems in your life are related to alcohol use. Listen to relatives, friends or co-workers when they ask you to examine your drinking habits or to seek help. Consider talking with someone who has had a problem with drinking but has stopped. Many people with alcohol use disorder hesitate to get treatment because they don't recognize that they have a problem. An intervention from loved ones can help some people recognize and accept that they need professional help. If you're concerned about someone who drinks too much, ask a professional experienced in alcohol treatment for advice on how to approach that person. Genetic, psychological, social and environmental factors can impact how drinking alcohol affects your body and behavior. Theories suggest that for certain people drinking has a different and stronger impact that can lead to alcohol use disorder. Over time, drinking too much alcohol may change the normal function of the areas of your brain associated with the experience of pleasure, judgment and the ability to exercise control over your behavior. This may result in craving alcohol to try to restore good feelings or reduce negative ones. Alcohol use may begin in the teens, but alcohol use disorder occurs more frequently in the 20s and 30s, though it can start at any age. Risk factors for alcohol use disorder include: Alcohol depresses your central nervous system. In some people, the initial reaction may feel like an increase in energy. But as you continue to drink, you become drowsy and have less control over your actions. Too much alcohol affects your speech, muscle coordination and vital centers of your brain. A heavy drinking binge may even cause a life-threatening coma or death. This is of particular concern when you're taking certain medications that also depress the brain's function. Excessive drinking can reduce your judgment skills and lower inhibitions, leading to poor choices and dangerous situations or behaviors, including: Drinking too much alcohol on a single occasion or over time can cause health problems, including: Early intervention can prevent alcohol-related problems in teens. If you have a teenager, be alert to signs and symptoms that may indicate a problem with alcohol: You can help prevent teenage alcohol use: ","Alcohol use disorder is a pattern of alcohol use that involves problems controlling your drinking, being preoccupied with alcohol or continuing to use alcohol even when it causes problems. This disorder also involves having to drink more to get the same effect or having withdrawal symptoms when you rapidly decrease or stop drinking. Alcohol use disorder includes a level of drinking that's sometimes called alcoholism. Unhealthy alcohol use includes any alcohol use that puts your health or safety at risk or causes other alcohol-related problems. It also includes binge drinking — a pattern of drinking where a male has five or more drinks within two hours or a female has at least four drinks within two hours. Binge drinking causes significant health and safety risks. If your pattern of drinking results in repeated significant distress and problems functioning in your daily life, you likely have alcohol use disorder. It can range from mild to severe. However, even a mild disorder can escalate and lead to serious problems, so early treatment is important. Alcohol use disorder can be mild, moderate or severe, based on the number of symptoms you experience. Signs and symptoms may include: Alcohol use disorder can include periods of being drunk (alcohol intoxication) and symptoms of withdrawal.

Alcoholic hepatitis,"The most common sign of alcoholic hepatitis is yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, called jaundice. The yellowing of the skin might be harder to see on Black and brown people. Other symptoms include: People with alcoholic hepatitis tend to be malnourished. Drinking large amounts of alcohol keeps people from being hungry. And heavy drinkers get most of their calories from alcohol. Other symptoms that happen with severe alcoholic hepatitis include: Alcoholic hepatitis is a serious, often deadly disease. See a healthcare professional if you: Alcoholic hepatitis is caused by damage to the liver from drinking alcohol. Just how alcohol damages the liver and why it does so only in some heavy drinkers isn't clear. These factors are known to play a role in alcoholic hepatitis: Other factors that can be involved with alcoholic hepatitis include: The major risk factor for alcoholic hepatitis is the how much alcohol you drink. It isn't known how much alcohol it takes to cause alcoholic hepatitis. Most people with this condition have had at least seven drinks a day for 20 years or more. This can mean 7 glasses of wine, 7 beers, or 7 shots of spirits. However, alcoholic hepatitis can happen to people who drink less and have other risk factors, including: Complications of alcoholic hepatitis are caused by scar tissue on the liver. Scar tissue can slow blood flow through the liver. That can raise pressure in a major blood vessel called the portal vein and cause a buildup of toxins. Complications include: You might reduce your risk of alcoholic hepatitis if you: ","Alcoholic hepatitis is swelling, called inflammation, of the liver caused by drinking alcohol. Drinking alcohol destroys liver cells. Alcoholic hepatitis most often happens in people who drink heavily over many years. But the link between drinking and alcoholic hepatitis isn't simple. Not all heavy drinkers get alcoholic hepatitis. And some people who drink much less get the disease. If you're diagnosed with alcoholic hepatitis, you must stop drinking alcohol. People who keep drinking alcohol have a high risk of serious liver damage and death. The most common sign of alcoholic hepatitis is yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, called jaundice.

Alpha-gal syndrome,"The symptoms of an alpha-gal allergic reaction usually take longer to start compared with those of other food allergies. Most reactions to common food allergens — peanuts or shellfish, for example — happen within minutes after you are exposed to them. In alpha-gal syndrome, reactions usually appear about 3 to 6 hours after you are exposed. Foods that can cause a reaction include: Symptoms of alpha-gal syndrome may include: The time delay between eating meat products and getting an allergic reaction may be one reason alpha-gal syndrome was not understood at first. For example, a possible connection between a T-bone steak with dinner and hives at midnight is far from clear. Researchers think they know the reason for the delayed reaction. They say it's due to the alpha-gal molecules taking longer than other allergens to be digested and enter the system that moves blood through the body. Get help if you have food allergy symptoms after you eat, even several hours after you eat. See your primary care health care provider or an allergy specialist, called an allergist. Don't rule out red meat as a possible cause of your reaction. That's even more important if you live or spend time in parts of the world where alpha-gal syndrome has been reported. Get emergency medical treatment if you have symptoms of a serious allergic reaction that causes trouble breathing, called anaphylaxis, such as: Most people with alpha-gal syndrome in the U.S. get the condition when a Lone Star tick bites them. Bites from other types of ticks can lead to the condition too. These other ticks cause alpha-gal syndrome in parts of Europe, Australia, Asia, South Africa, and South and Central America. Experts think the ticks that cause alpha-gal syndrome carry alpha-gal molecules. These come from the blood of the animals they usually bite, such as cows and sheep. When a tick that carries these molecules bites a human, the tick sends alpha-gal into the person's body. For unknown reasons, some people have a strong immune response to these molecules. The body makes proteins called antibodies. These antibodies target alpha-gal as something the immune system needs to clear out. The response is so strong that people with this allergy can no longer eat red meat. They cannot eat any foods made from mammals without having an allergic reaction. People who get many tick bites over time may develop worse symptoms. People with antibodies related to alpha-gal syndrome can have allergic reactions to the cancer drug cetuximab (Erbitux). Research appears to show that cases of this drug allergy are linked to alpha-gal syndrome. The antibodies that the immune system makes to alpha-gal seem to react to the structure of the drug as well. Health care providers don't yet know why some people get alpha-gal syndrome after exposure and others don't. The condition mostly happens in the south, east and central United States. You're at higher risk if you live or spend time in these regions and: In the past 20 to 30 years, the Lone Star tick has been found in large numbers as far north as Maine. This tick also has been found as far west as central Texas and Oklahoma. Alpha-gal syndrome also happens in other parts of the world. This includes parts of Europe, Australia, Asia, South Africa, and South and Central America. In those places, bites from certain types of ticks also appear to raise the risk of the condition. Alpha-gal syndrome can cause a serious allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. It can be deadly without treatment. Anaphylaxis is treated with prescription medicine called epinephrine, also known as adrenaline. You can give yourself a shot of epinephrine with a device called an auto-injector (EpiPen, Auvi-Q, others). You also need to go to the emergency room. Anaphylaxis symptoms can include: Health care providers think that some people who get anaphylaxis often and for no clear reason may be living with alpha-gal syndrome. They just haven't been diagnosed with it. The best way to prevent alpha-gal syndrome is to avoid areas where ticks live. Be careful in wooded, bushy areas with long grass. You can lower your risk of getting alpha-gal syndrome by following some simple tips:","Alpha-gal syndrome is a type of food allergy. It makes people allergic to red meat and other products made from mammals. In the United States, the condition usually begins with the bite of the Lone Star tick. The bite transfers a sugar molecule called alpha-gal into the body. In some people, this triggers a reaction from the body's defenses, also called the immune system. It causes mild to severe allergic reactions to red meat, such as beef, pork or lamb. It also can cause reactions to other foods that come from mammals, such as dairy products or gelatins. The Lone Star tick is found mainly in the southeastern United States. Most cases of alpha-gal syndrome are reported in the south, east and central United States. But the condition appears to be spreading farther north and west. Deer are carrying the Lone Star tick to new parts of the country. Other types of ticks carry alpha-gal molecules in different parts of the world. Alpha-gal syndrome has been diagnosed in parts of Europe, Australia, Asia, South Africa, and South and Central America. Some people may have alpha-gal syndrome and not know it. There are people who often have serious allergic reactions, also called anaphylactic reactions, for no clear reason. Tests also show that they don't have other food allergies. Researchers think that some of these people may be affected by alpha-gal syndrome. There's no treatment other than avoiding red meat and other products made from mammals. If you have a serious allergic reaction, you may need medicine called epinephrine and treatment at the emergency room. Avoid tick bites to prevent alpha-gal syndrome. Wear long pants and long-sleeved shirts when you're in wooded, grassy areas. Use bug spray too. Check your whole body for ticks after you spend time outside.

Alzheimer's disease,"Memory loss is the key symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Early in the disease, people may have trouble remembering recent events or conversations. Over time, memory gets worse and other symptoms occur. At first, someone with the disease may be aware of having trouble remembering things and thinking clearly. As signs and symptoms get worse, a family member or friend may be more likely to notice the issues. Brain changes from Alzheimer's disease lead to the following symptoms that get worse over time. Everyone has trouble with memory at times, but the memory loss related to Alzheimer's disease is lasting. Over time, memory loss affects the ability to function at work and at home. People with Alzheimer's disease may: Alzheimer's disease causes trouble concentrating and thinking, especially about abstract concepts such as numbers. Doing more than one task at once is especially hard. It may be challenging to manage finances, balance checkbooks and pay bills on time. Eventually people with Alzheimer's disease may not recognize numbers. Alzheimer's disease makes it hard to make sensible decisions and judgments. People with Alzheimer's disease may make poor choices in social settings or wear clothes for the wrong type of weather. Everyday problems may be hard to solve. Someone with Alzheimer's disease may not know how to handle food burning on the stove or how to make decisions when driving. Routine activities that involve completing steps in a certain order also can be hard for people with Alzheimer's disease. They may have trouble planning and cooking a meal or playing a favorite game. As Alzheimer's disease becomes advanced, people forget how to do basic tasks such as dressing and bathing. Brain changes that occur in Alzheimer's disease can affect moods and behaviors. Symptoms may include: Despite major changes to memory and skills, people with Alzheimer's disease are able to keep some skills even as symptoms get worse. These are known as preserved skills. They may include reading or listening to books, telling stories, sharing memories, singing, listening to music, dancing, drawing, or doing crafts. Preserved skills may last longer because they're managed by parts of the brain affected in later stages of the disease. Several conditions can cause memory loss or other dementia symptoms. Some of those conditions can be treated. If you are concerned about your memory or other thinking skills, talk to your healthcare professional. If you are concerned about the thinking skills you notice in a family member or friend, ask about going together to talk to a healthcare professional. The exact causes of Alzheimer's disease aren't fully understood. But at a basic level, brain proteins don't function as usual. This disrupts the work of brain cells, also known as neurons, and triggers a series of events. The neurons become damaged and lose connections to each other. They eventually die. Scientists believe that for most people, Alzheimer's disease is caused by a combination of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors that affect the brain over time. In less than 1% of people, Alzheimer's is caused by specific genetic changes that almost guarantee a person will develop the disease. For people in this group, the disease usually begins in middle age. The disease begins years before the first symptoms. The damage most often starts in the region of the brain that manages memory. The loss of neurons spreads in a somewhat predictable pattern to other regions of the brain. By the late stage of the disease, the brain has shrunk. Researchers trying to understand the cause of Alzheimer's disease are focused on the role of two proteins: Risk factors for Alzheimer's disease include age, family history, lifestyle and other factors. Older age is the strongest known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's isn't a part of typical aging. But as you grow older, the chances of getting the disease goes up. One study found that there were four new diagnoses per 1,000 people ages 65 to 74 every year. Among people ages 75 to 84, there were 32 new diagnoses per 1,000 people. For those 85 and older, there were 76 new diagnoses per 1,000 people. The risk of getting Alzheimer's disease is higher if a first-degree relative such as a parent or sibling was diagnosed with the disease. How genes among families affect the risk is largely not understood. The genetic factors are likely complex. A better understood genetic factor is a form of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. Having the form of the gene known as APOE e4 increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease. About 25% to 30% of the population carries APOE e4. But not everyone with this form of the gene develops the disease. Having two copies of APOE e4 increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease more than having one copy. Scientists have found rare changes in three genes that virtually guarantee a person who inherits one of them will develop Alzheimer's. But these changes account for less than 1% of people with Alzheimer's disease. Many people with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer's disease. This is likely related to having three copies of chromosome 21. Chromosome 21 is the gene involved in the production of the protein that leads to the creation of beta-amyloid. Beta-amyloid fragments can become plaques in the brain. Symptoms tend to appear 10 to 20 years earlier in people with Down syndrome than they do for the general population. Overall there are more women with the disease because they tend to live longer than men. Someone with mild cognitive impairment, also called MCI, has a bigger decline in memory or other thinking skills than is usual for the person's age. But the decline doesn't prevent the person from functioning at work or socially. However, people with MCI have a higher risk of getting dementia than are people who don't have mild cognitive impairment. When MCI affects mainly memory, the condition is more likely to progress to dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. A diagnosis of MCI offers people the chance to focus on healthy lifestyle changes and to come up with strategies to make up for memory loss. They also can schedule regular healthcare appointments to monitor symptoms. Several large studies found that people age 50 or older who had a traumatic brain injury, also called TBI, had a higher risk of getting dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The risk is even higher in people with serious TBIs or multiple TBIs. Studies in animals have found that air pollution particulates can speed the breakdown of the nervous system. Human studies have found that air pollution exposure — especially from traffic exhaust and burning wood — is linked to a higher risk of dementia. Drinking large amounts of alcohol has long been known to cause brain changes. Several large studies and reviews found that alcohol misuse is linked to a higher risk of dementia, especially early-onset dementia. Research has shown that poor sleep patterns, such as trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, are linked to a raised risk of Alzheimer's disease. Sleep apnea also may raise the risk of dementia. Research has shown that the same risk factors for heart disease also may increase the risk of dementia. It's not clear if these factors raise risk by worsening Alzheimer's changes in the brain or by leading to blood vessel changes in the brain. The factors include: High levels of low-density lipoprotein, known as LDL, cholesterol in middle age, in particular, raises the risk of dementia. Research has found that people younger than 65 with high LDL cholesterol levels have a higher risk of dementia. But taking medicines to lower LDL cholesterol didn't raise the risk. These factors can all be modified, so changing lifestyle habits can to some degree alter your risk. For example, regular exercise and a healthy low-fat diet rich in fruits and vegetables are related to a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. Studies have found that people who have hearing loss are at risk of dementia. The worse the hearing loss, the higher the risk. However, wearing hearing aids protects against getting dementia. Newer research suggests vision loss that isn't treated is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. The link may be due to a disease such as diabetes that can increase the risk of both vision loss and dementia. But some research suggests vision loss itself may increase the risk of dementia. Studies have found that being social and doing activities that stimulate the mind throughout life can lower the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Low education levels — less than a high school education — appear to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease can lead to a variety of complications. Symptoms such as memory loss, language loss, impaired judgment and other brain changes can make it harder to manage other health conditions. A person with Alzheimer's disease may not be able to: As Alzheimer's disease moves into its last stages, brain changes begin to affect physical functions. The changes can affect the ability to swallow, balance, and manage stool and bladder movements. These effects can lead to other health issues such as: Alzheimer's disease can't be prevented. But making lifestyle changes can lower your risk of getting the disease. Research suggests that taking steps that lower your risk of cardiovascular disease may reduce the risk of dementia, as well. To follow heart-healthy lifestyle choices that may lower the risk of dementia: One large, long-term study done in Finland found that making lifestyle changes helped reduce cognitive decline among people who were at risk of dementia. Those in the study were given individual and group sessions that focused on diet, exercise and social activities. Several studies have found that following a Mediterranean diet leads to better cognitive function and a slower cognitive decline with age. A Mediterranean diet focuses on plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, grains, fish, poultry, nuts and olive oil. The diet includes less foods that are high in saturated fats and trans fats, such as butter, margarine, cheese, red meat, fried food and pastries. It's also important to treat vision loss and hearing loss. Studies have found that vision loss that isn't treated is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. Studies also have found that people who have hearing loss are at higher risk of dementia. But wearing hearing aids made people less likely to get dementia. Other studies have shown that staying engaged mentally and socially is linked to preserved thinking skills later in life and a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. This includes going to social events, reading, dancing, playing board games, creating art, playing an instrument and other activities. ","Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. Alzheimer's disease is the biological process that begins with the appearance of a buildup of proteins in the form of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. This causes brain cells to die over time and the brain to shrink. About 6.9 million people in the United States age 65 and older live with Alzheimer's disease. Among them, more than 70% are age 75 and older. Of the more than 55 million people in the world with dementia, 60% to 70% are estimated to have Alzheimer's disease. Early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease include forgetting recent events or conversations. Over time, Alzheimer's disease leads to serious memory loss and affects a person's ability to do everyday tasks. There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. In advanced stages, loss of brain function can cause dehydration, poor nutrition or infection. These complications can result in death. But medicines may improve symptoms or slow the decline in thinking. Programs and services can help support people with the disease and their caregivers. Memory loss is the key symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Early in the disease, people may have trouble remembering recent events or conversations. Over time, memory gets worse and other symptoms occur.

Routine activities that involve completing steps in a certain order also can be hard for people with Alzheimer's disease. They may have trouble planning and cooking a meal or playing a favorite game. As Alzheimer's disease becomes advanced, people forget how to do basic tasks such as dressing and bathing. Brain changes that occur in Alzheimer's disease can affect moods and behaviors. Symptoms may include: Despite major changes to memory and skills, people with Alzheimer's disease are able to keep some skills even as symptoms get worse. These are known as preserved skills. They may include reading or listening to books, telling stories, sharing memories, singing, listening to music, dancing, drawing, or doing crafts. Preserved skills may last longer because they're managed by parts of the brain affected in later stages of the disease. Several conditions can cause memory loss or other dementia symptoms. Some of those conditions can be treated. If you are concerned about your memory or other thinking skills, talk to your healthcare professional. If you are concerned about the thinking skills you notice in a family member or friend, ask about going together to talk to a healthcare professional. The exact causes of Alzheimer's disease aren't fully understood. But at a basic level, brain proteins don't function as usual. This disrupts the work of brain cells, also known as neurons, and triggers a series of events. The neurons become damaged and lose connections to each other. They eventually die. Scientists believe that for most people, Alzheimer's disease is caused by a combination of genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors that affect the brain over time. In less than 1% of people, Alzheimer's is caused by specific genetic changes that almost guarantee a person will develop the disease. For people in this group, the disease usually begins in middle age. The disease begins years before the first symptoms. The damage most often starts in the region of the brain that manages memory. The loss of neurons spreads in a somewhat predictable pattern to other regions of the brain. By the late stage of the disease, the brain has shrunk. Researchers trying to understand the cause of Alzheimer's disease are focused on the role of two proteins: Risk factors for Alzheimer's disease include age, family history, lifestyle and other factors. Older age is the strongest known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's isn't a part of typical aging. But as you grow older, the chances of getting the disease goes up. One study found that there were four new diagnoses per 1,000 people ages 65 to 74 every year. Among people ages 75 to 84, there were 32 new diagnoses per 1,000 people. For those 85 and older, there were 76 new diagnoses per 1,000 people. The risk of getting Alzheimer's disease is higher if a first-degree relative such as a parent or sibling was diagnosed with the disease. How genes among families affect the risk is largely not understood. The genetic factors are likely complex. A better understood genetic factor is a form of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene. Having the form of the gene known as APOE e4 increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease. About 25% to 30% of the population carries APOE e4. But not everyone with this form of the gene develops the disease. Having two copies of APOE e4 increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease more than having one copy. Scientists have found rare changes in three genes that virtually guarantee a person who inherits one of them will develop Alzheimer's. But these changes account for less than 1% of people with Alzheimer's disease. Many people with Down syndrome develop Alzheimer's disease. This is likely related to having three copies of chromosome 21. Chromosome 21 is the gene involved in the production of the protein that leads to the creation of beta-amyloid. Beta-amyloid fragments can become plaques in the brain. Symptoms tend to appear 10 to 20 years earlier in people with Down syndrome than they do for the general population. Overall there are more women with the disease because they tend to live longer than men. Someone with mild cognitive impairment, also called MCI, has a bigger decline in memory or other thinking skills than is usual for the person's age. But the decline doesn't prevent the person from functioning at work or socially. However, people with MCI have a higher risk of getting dementia than are people who don't have mild cognitive impairment. When MCI affects mainly memory, the condition is more likely to progress to dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. A diagnosis of MCI offers people the chance to focus on healthy lifestyle changes and to come up with strategies to make up for memory loss. They also can schedule regular healthcare appointments to monitor symptoms. Several large studies found that people age 50 or older who had a traumatic brain injury, also called TBI, had a higher risk of getting dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The risk is even higher in people with serious TBIs or multiple TBIs. Studies in animals have found that air pollution particulates can speed the breakdown of the nervous system. Human studies have found that air pollution exposure — especially from traffic exhaust and burning wood — is linked to a higher risk of dementia. Drinking large amounts of alcohol has long been known to cause brain changes. Several large studies and reviews found that alcohol misuse is linked to a higher risk of dementia, especially early-onset dementia. Research has shown that poor sleep patterns, such as trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, are linked to a raised risk of Alzheimer's disease. Sleep apnea also may raise the risk of dementia. Research has shown that the same risk factors for heart disease also may increase the risk of dementia. It's not clear if these factors raise risk by worsening Alzheimer's changes in the brain or by leading to blood vessel changes in the brain. The factors include: High levels of low-density lipoprotein, known as LDL, cholesterol in middle age, in particular, raises the risk of dementia. Research has found that people younger than 65 with high LDL cholesterol levels have a higher risk of dementia. But taking medicines to lower LDL cholesterol didn't raise the risk. These factors can all be modified, so changing lifestyle habits can to some degree alter your risk. For example, regular exercise and a healthy low-fat diet rich in fruits and vegetables are related to a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. Studies have found that people who have hearing loss are at risk of dementia. The worse the hearing loss, the higher the risk. However, wearing hearing aids protects against getting dementia. Newer research suggests vision loss that isn't treated is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. The link may be due to a disease such as diabetes that can increase the risk of both vision loss and dementia. But some research suggests vision loss itself may increase the risk of dementia. Studies have found that being social and doing activities that stimulate the mind throughout life can lower the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Low education levels — less than a high school education — appear to be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease can lead to a variety of complications. Symptoms such as memory loss, language loss, impaired judgment and other brain changes can make it harder to manage other health conditions. A person with Alzheimer's disease may not be able to: As Alzheimer's disease moves into its last stages, brain changes begin to affect physical functions. The changes can affect the ability to swallow, balance, and manage stool and bladder movements. These effects can lead to other health issues such as: Alzheimer's disease can't be prevented. But making lifestyle changes can lower your risk of getting the disease. Research suggests that taking steps that lower your risk of cardiovascular disease may reduce the risk of dementia, as well. To follow heart-healthy lifestyle choices that may lower the risk of dementia: One large, long-term study done in Finland found that making lifestyle changes helped reduce cognitive decline among people who were at risk of dementia. Those in the study were given individual and group sessions that focused on diet, exercise and social activities. Several studies have found that following a Mediterranean diet leads to better cognitive function and a slower cognitive decline with age. A Mediterranean diet focuses on plant-based foods such as fruits, vegetables, grains, fish, poultry, nuts and olive oil. The diet includes less foods that are high in saturated fats and trans fats, such as butter, margarine, cheese, red meat, fried food and pastries. It's also important to treat vision loss and hearing loss. Studies have found that vision loss that isn't treated is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. Studies also have found that people who have hearing loss are at higher risk of dementia. But wearing hearing aids made people less likely to get dementia. Other studies have shown that staying engaged mentally and socially is linked to preserved thinking skills later in life and a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. This includes going to social events, reading, dancing, playing board games, creating art, playing an instrument and other activities. "
Amyloidosis,"You may not experience symptoms of amyloidosis until later in the course of the disease. Symptoms may vary, depending on which organs are affected. Signs and symptoms of amyloidosis may include: See your health care provider if you regularly experience any of the signs or symptoms associated with amyloidosis. There are many different types of amyloidosis. Some types are hereditary. Others are caused by outside factors, such as inflammatory diseases or long-term dialysis. Many types affect multiple organs. Others affect only one part of the body. Types of amyloidosis include: Factors that increase the risk of amyloidosis include: Amyloidosis can seriously damage the: ","Amyloidosis (am-uh-loi-DO-sis) is a rare disease that occurs when a protein called amyloid builds up in organs. This amyloid buildup can make the organs not work properly. Organs that may be affected include the heart, kidneys, liver, spleen, nervous system and digestive tract. Some types of amyloidosis occur with other diseases. These types may improve with treatment of the other diseases. Some types of amyloidosis may lead to life-threatening organ failure. Treatments may include chemotherapy with strong drugs used to treat cancer. Other types of medications can reduce amyloid production and control symptoms.

Anorexia nervosa,"The physical and behavioral symptoms of anorexia nervosa relate to how starvation affects the brain. It may be hard to notice symptoms because what is seen as a low body weight differs for each person. Some people with anorexia may not look very thin. Also, people often hide their thinness, eating habits or physical problems. Physical symptoms of anorexia nervosa may include irregular heart rhythms, low blood pressure and dehydration. Dehydration happens when your body doesn't have enough water and other fluids to carry out normal functions. Your fingers may look blue and you may have dry skin. You may notice a change in your skin color, such as yellowing of the skin. You may have hair that thins, breaks or falls out. You also may have soft, downy hair covering your body. Other physical symptoms include: If you're female and not taking a contraceptive, you may not have menstrual periods. You may have an extreme focus on food. Sometimes this includes cooking meals for others but not eating those meals. You may skip meals or refuse to eat. You also may severely limit the amount of food you eat through dieting or fasting, not admit to being hungry, or make excuses for not eating. When you eat, you may eat only a few certain ""safe"" foods — often foods low in fat and calories. You also may focus too much on eating ""clean"" or healthy and stop eating specific types of food in a way that has not been recommended by a healthcare professional. You may take on rigid meal or eating habits, such as spitting out food after chewing. You may not want to eat in public. You also may lie about how much food you've eaten. You may have a type of anorexia where you binge and purge like with bulimia. Binges are when you feel like you can't control what or how much you eat. Binges can sometimes be large amounts of food. But overall, if you have the binge-purge type of anorexia, you eat much less than you need. Purges are when you make yourself vomit, or you misuse enemas, laxatives, diuretics, diet aids or herbal products to get rid of food that you ate. You lose too much weight and have very low body weight, compared with your personal weight history. Other emotional and behavioral symptoms of anorexia may include: You also may hurt yourself. Or you may think or talk about suicide or attempt suicide. Because of how malnutrition affects the brain, someone with anorexia may not want to be treated. A core feature of anorexia is that people with the eating disorder usually don't see how serious their symptoms are. This is because of the way anorexia affects the brain. If someone in your life has anorexia, it's better to take action — even if you think it could be an overreaction — rather than let symptoms continue. Early treatment of eating disorders leads to the best outcomes. If you're worried about a loved one, urge your loved one to talk to a healthcare professional. If you're a parent or caregiver who is concerned about your child's eating habits, weight or body image, share your concerns with your child's healthcare professional. If you think you have an eating disorder, get help. If you're thinking about suicide, contact a suicide hotline.

The Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in the U.S. has a Spanish language phone line at1-888-628-9454(toll-free). The causes of anorexia nervosa aren't known. As with many diseases, it's probably a mix of factors: Anorexia nervosa affects all gender identities, races, ages, incomes and body types. Anorexia also is more common among teenagers, although people of any age can develop this eating disorder. Teens may be more at risk because of all the changes their bodies go through during puberty. They also may face more peer pressure and be more sensitive to criticism or even casual comments about weight or body shape. Certain factors raise the risk of anorexia and other eating disorders, including: Anorexia nervosa can have many complications. At its most severe, it can be fatal. Death may happen suddenly — even if you aren't visibly underweight. Irregular heart rhythms, also known as arrhythmias, can lead to death. Also, an imbalance of electrolytes — minerals such as sodium, potassium and calcium that maintain the balance of fluids in the body — also can lead to death. Other complications of anorexia include: In females, anorexia can lead to having no period. In males, it can decrease testosterone. If you become severely malnourished, every organ system in your body can be damaged. This damage may not be fully reversible, even when the anorexia is under control. In addition to physical complications, you also may have other mental health symptoms and conditions, including: There's no guaranteed way to prevent anorexia nervosa. Primary healthcare professionals, including pediatricians, family medicine professionals and internal medicine professionals, may be in a good position to see early signs that could lead to anorexia. For instance, they can ask questions about eating habits and satisfaction with appearance during routine medical appointments. This could open a discussion about how this relates to health and where to get help if needed. If you notice that people have dieting habits that seem too rigid, or they're unhappy with their appearance, think about talking to them about these issues. Although you may not be able to prevent an eating disorder from starting, you can talk about your concerns and offer to assist them in finding help if needed. Examples of organizations that offer support for caregivers, friends and family members of people with eating disorders include the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) and Families Empowered and Supporting Treatment for Eating Disorders (F.E.A.S.T.). ","Anorexia (an-o-REK-see-uh) nervosa, often simply called anorexia, is a treatable eating disorder in which people have a low body weight based on personal weight history. Although many people with anorexia look very thin, some may not look thin and others may look overweight. But they've actually lost weight or failed to gain needed weight. People who have anorexia often have a strong fear of gaining weight and may think they're overweight, even when they're thin. To prevent weight gain or continue to lose weight, people with anorexia often limit the amount or type of food they eat. They place a high value on controlling their weight and shape and use extreme efforts that can greatly harm their lives. Anorexia can cause changes in the brain due to very poor nutrition, also called malnutrition. This is when people don't get the nutrients that their bodies need to stay healthy. So it's not a choice to continue the risky and damaging behavior. If left untreated, weight loss can get to a point where people with anorexia are at high risk of serious physical harm or death. Anorexia has the second-highest death rate of any mental illness, surpassed only by opioid overdoses. Most deaths related to anorexia stem from heart conditions and suicide. Anorexia, like other eating disorders, can take over people's lives and be very hard to overcome. Because it's related to changes in the brain, anorexia behaviors are not choices, and the illness is not really about food or looking a certain way. With proven treatment, people with anorexia can return to a healthy weight, develop more-balanced eating habits, and reverse some of anorexia's serious medical and mental health complications.

Anthrax,"There are four common routes of anthrax infection, each with different signs and symptoms. In most cases, symptoms develop within six days of exposure to the bacteria. However, it's possible for inhalation anthrax symptoms to take more than six weeks to appear.
A skin-related (cutaneous) anthrax infection enters your body through your skin, usually through a cut or other sore. It's by far the most common route of the disease. It's also the mildest. With appropriate treatment, cutaneous anthrax is seldom fatal. Signs and symptoms include:
You can contract anthrax when spores penetrate your skin, usually through an open wound. The infection begins as a raised, sometimes itchy, bump resembling an insect bite. But within a day or two, the bump develops into an open, usually painless sore with a black center.
A gastrointestinal anthrax infection results from eating undercooked meat from an infected animal. It can affect your gastrointestinal tract from your throat to your colon. Signs and symptoms include:
Inhalation anthrax develops when you breathe in anthrax spores. It's the most deadly form of the disease, and is often fatal, even with treatment. Initial signs and symptoms include:
This illustration shows how the spores that cause inhalation anthrax — the most deadly form of anthrax infection — enter and affect the body.
This recently identified route of anthrax infection has so far been reported only in Europe. It's contracted through injecting illegal drugs. Initial signs and symptoms include:
Many common illnesses start with symptoms that resemble the flu. The chances that your sore throat and aching muscles are due to anthrax are extremely small.
If you think you may have been exposed — for example, if you work in an environment where anthrax is likely to occur — see a doctor immediately for evaluation and care. If you develop signs and symptoms of the disorder after exposure to animals or animal products in parts of the world where anthrax is common, seek prompt medical attention. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial.","Anthrax is a rare but serious illness caused by a spore-forming bacterium, Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax mainly affects livestock and wild game. Humans can become infected through direct or indirect contact with sick animals.
There's no evidence that anthrax is transmitted from person to person, but it's possible that anthrax skin lesions may be contagious through direct contact or through contact with a contaminated object (fomite). Usually, anthrax bacteria enter the body through a wound in the skin. You can also become infected by eating contaminated meat or inhaling the spores.
Signs and symptoms, which depend on how you're infected, can include skin sores, vomiting and shock. Prompt treatment with antibiotics can cure most anthrax infections. Inhaled anthrax is more difficult to treat and can be fatal.
Anthrax is very rare in the developed world. However, the illness remains a concern because the bacteria have been used in bioterrorism attacks in the United States."
Arteriovenous malformation,"Symptoms of an arteriovenous malformation, also known as an AVM, can vary. Sometimes anAVMdoesn't cause symptoms. TheAVMcan be found while getting images for another health concern. Often the first symptoms appear after bleeding occurs. Besides bleeding, symptoms can include: Other possible symptoms include: Children and teens might have trouble with learning or behavior. One type ofAVMcalled a vein of Galen malformation causes symptoms that appear at or shortly after birth. A vein of Galen malformation occurs deep inside the brain. Signs can include: Seek medical attention if you have any of the symptoms of anAVM, such as headaches, dizziness, vision problems, seizures and changes in thinking. ManyAVMsare found during testing for a different condition, such as during aCTscan or anMRI. An arteriovenous malformation happens when arteries and veins connect in an irregular way. Experts don't understand why this happens. Certain genetic changes might play a role, but most types are not usually passed down in families. Rarely, having a family history of an arteriovenous malformation can increase your risk. But most types aren't inherited. Certain hereditary conditions can increase your risk of an arteriovenous malformation. These include hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. The most common complications of an arteriovenous malformation are bleeding and seizures. Bleeding can cause brain damage and may cause death if you don't get treated. ","An arteriovenous malformation, also known as an AVM, is a tangle of blood vessels that creates irregular connections between arteries and veins. This disrupts blood flow and prevents tissues from receiving oxygen. AnAVMcan occur anywhere in the body, including in the brain. Arteries move oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the brain and other organs. Veins drain the oxygen-depleted blood back to the lungs and heart. When anAVMdisrupts this critical process, surrounding tissues might not get enough oxygen. Because the tangled blood vessels in anAVMdo not form properly, they can weaken and burst. If anAVMin the brain bursts, it can cause bleeding in the brain, which can lead to a stroke or brain damage. Bleeding in the brain is known as a hemorrhage.

Asthma,"Asthma symptoms vary from person to person. You may have infrequent asthma attacks, have symptoms only at certain times — such as when exercising — or have symptoms all the time. Asthma signs and symptoms include: Signs that your asthma is probably worsening include: For some people, asthma signs and symptoms flare up in certain situations: Severe asthma attacks can be life-threatening. Work with your doctor to determine what to do when your signs and symptoms worsen — and when you need emergency treatment. Signs of an asthma emergency include: See your doctor: It isn't clear why some people get asthma and others don't, but it's probably due to a combination of environmental and inherited (genetic) factors. Exposure to various irritants and substances that trigger allergies (allergens) can trigger signs and symptoms of asthma. Asthma triggers are different from person to person and can include: A number of factors are thought to increase your chances of developing asthma.

While there's no way to prevent asthma, you and your doctor can design a step-by-step plan for living with your condition and preventing asthma attacks. ","Asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and may produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, a whistling sound (wheezing) when you breathe out and shortness of breath. For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack. Asthma can't be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled.

Astrocytoma,"Astrocytoma signs and symptoms may vary based on where the tumor starts. This tumor can happen in the brain or in the spinal cord. Symptoms of astrocytomas in the brain include: Symptoms of astrocytomas in the spinal cord include: Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have ongoing symptoms that worry you. The cause of astrocytoma often isn't known. This tumor starts as a growth of cells in the brain or spinal cord. It forms in cells called astrocytes. Astrocytes support and connect nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Astrocytoma happens when astrocytes develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In tumor cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the tumor cells to grow and multiply quickly. Tumor cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. The tumor cells form a growth that may press on nearby parts of the brain or spinal cord as it gets bigger. Sometimes the DNA changes turn the tumor cells into cancer cells. Cancer cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. Risk factors for astrocytoma include: There is no way to prevent astrocytoma. ","Astrocytoma is a growth of cells that starts in the brain or spinal cord. The growth, called a tumor, starts in cells called astrocytes. Astrocytes support and connect nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Astrocytoma symptoms vary based on the tumor's location. An astrocytoma in the brain can cause personality changes, seizures, headaches and nausea. An astrocytoma in the spinal cord can cause weakness and disability in the area affected by the growing tumor. Some astrocytomas grow slowly. They aren't considered to be cancerous. These noncancerous tumors are sometimes called benign astrocytomas. Most astrocytomas grow quickly and are considered to be brain cancers. These are sometimes called malignant astrocytomas. Whether your tumor is benign or malignant is one factor your healthcare team considers when creating a treatment plan. Astrocytoma signs and symptoms may vary based on where the tumor starts. This tumor can happen in the brain or in the spinal cord. Symptoms of astrocytomas in the brain include: Symptoms of astrocytomas in the spinal cord include: Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have ongoing symptoms that worry you. The cause of astrocytoma often isn't known. This tumor starts as a growth of cells in the brain or spinal cord. It forms in cells called astrocytes. Astrocytes support and connect nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Astrocytoma happens when astrocytes develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In tumor cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the tumor cells to grow and multiply quickly. Tumor cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. The tumor cells form a growth that may press on nearby parts of the brain or spinal cord as it gets bigger. Sometimes the DNA changes turn the tumor cells into cancer cells. Cancer cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. Risk factors for astrocytoma include: There is no way to prevent astrocytoma. "
Atrial fibrillation,"Symptoms ofAFibmay include: Some people with atrial fibrillation (AFib) don't notice any symptoms. Atrial fibrillation may be: If you have symptoms of atrial fibrillation, make an appointment for a health checkup. You may be referred to a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist. If you have chest pain, seek immediate medical help. Chest pain could mean that you're having a heart attack. To understand the causes of atrial fibrillation (AFib), it may be helpful to know how the heart typically beats. The heart has four chambers: Inside the upper right heart chamber is a group of cells called the sinus node. The sinus node makes the signals that starts each heartbeat. The signals move across the upper heart chambers. Next, the signals arrive at a group of cells called theAVnode, where they usually slow down. The signals then go to the lower heart chambers. In a healthy heart, this signaling process usually goes smoothly. The resting heart rate is typically 60 to 100 beats a minute. But in atrial fibrillation, the signals in the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic. As a result, the upper chambers tremble or shake. TheAVnode is flooded with signals trying to get through to the lower heart chambers. This causes a fast and irregular heart rhythm. In people withAFib, the heart rate may range from 100 to 175 beats a minute. Problems with the heart's structure are the most common cause of atrial fibrillation (AFib). Heart diseases and health problems that can causeAFibinclude: Heart surgery or stress due to surgery or sickness may also causeAFib. Some people who have atrial fibrillation have no known heart disease or heart damage. Lifestyle habits that can trigger anAFibepisode may include: Things that can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation (AFib) include: Blood clots are a dangerous complication of atrial fibrillation (AFib). Blood clots can lead to stroke. The risk of stroke fromAFibincreases as you grow older. Other health conditions also may increase the risk of a stroke due toAFib. These conditions include: Blood thinners are commonly prescribed to prevent blood clots and strokes in people with atrial fibrillation. Healthy lifestyle choices can reduce the risk of heart disease and may prevent atrial fibrillation (AFib). Here are some basic heart-healthy tips: ","Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm. An irregular heart rhythm is called an arrhythmia.AFibcan lead to blood clots in the heart. The condition also increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications. During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers — called the atria — beat chaotically and irregularly. They beat out of sync with the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. For many people,AFibmay have no symptoms. ButAFibmay cause a fast, pounding heartbeat, shortness of breath or light-headedness. Episodes of atrial fibrillation may come and go, or they may be persistent.AFibitself usually isn't life-threatening. But it's a serious medical condition that needs proper treatment to prevent stroke. Treatment for atrial fibrillation may include medicines, therapy to shock the heart back to a regular rhythm and procedures to block faulty heart signals. A person with atrial fibrillation also may have a related heart rhythm problem called atrial flutter. The treatments forAFiband atrial flutter are similar. Symptoms ofAFibmay include: Some people with atrial fibrillation (AFib) don't notice any symptoms.

Basal cell carcinoma,"Basal cell carcinoma usually develops on sun-exposed parts of your body, especially your head and neck. Less often, basal cell carcinoma can develop on parts of your body usually protected from the sun, such as the genitals.
Basal cell carcinoma appears as a change in the skin, such as a growth or a sore that won't heal. These changes in the skin (lesions) usually have one of the following characteristics:
Make an appointment with your health care provider if you observe changes in the appearance of your skin, such as a new growth, a change in a previous growth or a recurring sore.","Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer. Basal cell carcinoma begins in the basal cells — a type of cell within the skin that produces new skin cells as old ones die off.
Basal cell carcinoma often appears as a slightly transparent bump on the skin, though it can take other forms. Basal cell carcinoma occurs most often on areas of the skin that are exposed to the sun, such as your head and neck.
Most basal cell carcinomas are thought to be caused by long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight. Avoiding the sun and using sunscreen may help protect against basal cell carcinoma.
Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that most often develops on areas of skin exposed to the sun, such as the face. On white skin, basal cell carcinoma often looks like a bump that's skin-colored or pink.
Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that most often develops on areas of skin exposed to the sun, such as the face. On brown and Black skin, basal cell carcinoma often looks like a bump that's brown or glossy black and has a rolled border."
Bell's palsy,"Symptoms of Bell's palsy come on suddenly and may include: Rarely, Bell's palsy can affect the nerves on both sides of the face. Seek medical help right away if you experience any type of paralysis because you may be having a stroke. Bell's palsy is not caused by a stroke, but the symptoms of both conditions are similar. If you have facial weakness or drooping, see your healthcare professional to find out the cause and the severity of the illness. Although the exact reason Bell's palsy occurs isn't clear, it's often related to having a viral infection. Viruses that have been linked to Bell's palsy include viruses that cause: The nerve that controls facial muscles passes through a narrow corridor of bone on its way to the face. In Bell's palsy, that nerve becomes inflamed and swollen — usually related to a viral infection. Besides affecting facial muscles, the nerve affects tears, saliva, taste and a small bone in the middle of the ear. Bell's palsy occurs more often in people who: It's rare for Bell's palsy to come back. But when it does, there's often a family history of repeated attacks. This suggests that Bell's palsy might have something to do with genes. Mild symptoms of Bell's palsy typically disappear within a month. Recovery from more-complete facial paralysis can vary. Complications may include: ","Bell's palsy is a condition that causes sudden weakness in the muscles on one side of the face. Often the weakness is short-term and improves over weeks. The weakness makes half of the face appear to droop. Smiles are one-sided, and the eye on the affected side is hard to close. Bell's palsy also is known as acute peripheral facial palsy of unknown cause. It can occur at any age. The exact cause is not known. Experts think it's caused by swelling and irritation of the nerve that controls the muscles on one side of the face. Bell's palsy could be caused by a reaction that occurs after a viral infection. Symptoms usually start to improve within a few weeks, with complete recovery in about six months. A small number of people continue to have some Bell's palsy symptoms for life. Rarely, Bell's palsy occurs more than once. Symptoms of Bell's palsy come on suddenly and may include: Rarely, Bell's palsy can affect the nerves on both sides of the face.

Complications may include: "
Septic arthritis,"Septic arthritis typically causes extreme discomfort and difficulty using the affected joint. The joint could be swollen, red and warm, and you might have a fever.
If septic arthritis occurs in an artificial joint (prosthetic joint infection), signs and symptoms such as minor pain and swelling may develop months or years after knee replacement or hip replacement surgery. Also, a loosening of the joint may occur, which causes pain while moving the joint or while putting weight on the joint. Typically, the pain goes away when at rest. In extreme cases, the joint may become dislocated.
See your doctor if you have severe pain in a joint that comes on suddenly. Prompt treatment can help minimize joint damage.
If you have an artificial joint, see your doctor if you experience pain while using the joint.","Septic arthritis is a painful infection in a joint that can come from germs that travel through your bloodstream from another part of your body. Septic arthritis can also occur when a penetrating injury, such as an animal bite or trauma, delivers germs directly into the joint.
Infants and older adults are most likely to develop septic arthritis. People who have artificial joints are also at risk of septic arthritis. Knees are most commonly affected, but septic arthritis also can affect hips, shoulders and other joints. The infection can quickly and severely damage the cartilage and bone within the joint, so prompt treatment is crucial.
Treatment involves draining the joint with a needle or during surgery. Antibiotics also are usually needed."
Botulism,"Symptoms of foodborne botulism typically begin 12 to 36 hours after the toxin gets into your body. But depending on how much toxin you consumed, the start of symptoms may range from a few hours to a few days. Symptoms of foodborne botulism include: Symptoms of wound botulism appear about 10 days after the toxin enters your body. Wound botulism symptoms include: The area around the wound may not always appear swollen and show a change of color. Problems generally begin 18 to 36 hours after the toxin enters the baby's body. Symptoms include: Certain symptoms don't typically occur with botulism. For example, botulism doesn't usually raise blood pressure or heart rate or cause fever or confusion. Sometimes, though, wound botulism may cause fever. In iatrogenic botulism — when the toxin is injected for cosmetic or medical reasons — there have been rare occurrences of serious side effects. These may include headache, facial paralysis, and muscle weakness. Seek urgent medical care if you suspect that you have botulism. Initial treatment increases your survival chances and lowers your risk of complications. Getting medical care quickly can also alert public health officials about episodes of foodborne botulism. They may be able to keep other people from eating contaminated food. Keep in mind, though, that botulism can't spread from person to person. An unusual cluster of botulism — especially in people with no clear link — that develops in about 12 to 48 hours may raise suspicion of bioterrorism. The typical source of foodborne botulism is homemade food that is improperly canned or preserved. These foods are typically fruits, vegetables, and fish. Other foods, such as spicy peppers (chiles), foil-wrapped baked potatoes and oil infused with garlic, may also be sources of botulism. When C. botulinum bacteria get into a wound, they can multiply and make toxin. The wound may be a cut that wasn't noticed. Or the wound may be caused by a traumatic injury or surgery. Wound botulism has increased in recent decades in people who inject heroin, which can contain spores of the bacteria. In fact, this form of botulism is more common in people who inject black tar heroin. Babies get infant botulism when the bacteria spores get into their intestines and make toxin. In some cases, the source of infant botulism may be honey. But it's more likely to be exposure to soil contaminated with the bacteria. In rare cases, this form of intestinal botulism also affects adults. Rarely, botulism happens when too much botulinum toxin is injected for cosmetic reasons, such as removing wrinkles, or for medical reasons, such as treating migraines. Because it affects muscle control throughout your body, botulinum toxin can cause many complications. The most immediate danger is that you won't be able to breathe. Being unable to breathe is a common cause of death in botulism. Other complications, which may need rehabilitation, may include: Use proper techniques when canning or preserving foods at home to make sure botulism germs are destroyed. It's also important to prepare and store food safely: To prevent wound botulism and other serious bloodborne diseases, never inject or inhale street drugs. Keep wounds clean to prevent infection. If you think a wound is infected, seek medical treatment right away. To lower the risk of infant botulism, avoid giving honey — even a tiny taste — to children under the age of 1 year. To prevent iatrogenic botulism, be sure to go to a licensed health care provider for any cosmetic or medical procedures using various forms of botulinum toxin. They include onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox), abobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport) and others. ","Botulism is a rare but serious condition caused by a toxin that attacks the body's nerves. Botulism may cause life-threatening symptoms. A type of bacteria called Clostridium botulinum produces the toxin. Botulism can occur as the result of food or wound contamination. The condition can also occur when bacterial spores grow in the intestines of infants. In rare cases, botulism can also be caused by medical treatment or bioterrorism. Three common forms of botulism are: Occasionally, botulism happens when too much botulinum toxin is injected for cosmetic or medical reasons. This rare form is called iatrogenic botulism. The term ""iatrogenic"" means an illness caused by medical exam or treatment. Another rare form of botulism can occur from inhaling toxins. This may happen as the result of bioterrorism. All forms of botulism can be fatal and are considered medical emergencies. Symptoms of foodborne botulism typically begin 12 to 36 hours after the toxin gets into your body. But depending on how much toxin you consumed, the start of symptoms may range from a few hours to a few days.

Brain aneurysm,"Most brain aneurysms that haven't ruptured don't cause symptoms. This is especially true if they're small. Brain aneurysms may be found during imaging tests that are done for other conditions. However, a ruptured aneurysm is a very serious condition, typically causing a severe headache. And if an unruptured aneurysm presses against brain tissue or nerves, it may cause pain and other symptoms. A sudden, severe headache is the key symptom of a ruptured aneurysm. This headache is often described by people as the worst headache they've ever experienced. In addition to a severe headache, symptoms of a ruptured aneurysm can include: In some cases, an aneurysm may leak a slight amount of blood. When this happens, a more severe rupture often follows. Leaks may happen days or weeks before a rupture. Leaking brain aneurysm symptoms may include: An unruptured brain aneurysm may not have any symptoms, especially if it's small. However, a larger unruptured aneurysm may press on brain tissues and nerves. Symptoms of an unruptured brain aneurysm may include: Seek immediate medical attentionif you develop a: If you're with someone who complains of a sudden, severe headache or who loses consciousness or has a seizure, call 911 or your local emergency number. Brain aneurysms are caused by thinning artery walls. Aneurysms often form at forks or branches in arteries because those areas of the vessels are weaker. Although aneurysms can appear anywhere in the brain, they're most common in arteries at the base of the brain. Several factors can contribute to weakness in an artery wall. These factors may increase the risk of a brain aneurysm or aneurysm rupture. Some of these risk factors develop over time. But some conditions present at birth can increase the risk of developing a brain aneurysm. Risk factors include: Some types of aneurysms may occur after a head injury or from certain blood infections. There are some factors that make it more likely an aneurysm will rupture. They include: When a brain aneurysm ruptures, the bleeding usually lasts only a few seconds. However, the blood can cause direct damage to surrounding cells and can kill brain cells. It also increases pressure inside the skull. If the pressure becomes too high, it may disrupt the blood and oxygen supply to the brain. Loss of consciousness or even death may occur. Complications that can develop after the rupture of an aneurysm include: In many cases, brain aneurysms can't be prevented. But there are some changes you can make to lower your risk. They include quitting smoking if you smoke. Also work with your health care provider to lower your blood pressure if it's high. Don't drink large amounts of alcohol or use drugs such as cocaine. ","A brain aneurysm (AN-yoo-riz-um) — also known as a cerebral aneurysm or intracranial aneurysm — is a bulge or ballooning in a blood vessel in the brain. An aneurysm often looks like a berry hanging on a stem. Experts think brain aneurysms form and grow because blood flowing through the blood vessel puts pressure on a weak area of the vessel wall. This can increase the size of the brain aneurysm. If the brain aneurysm leaks or ruptures, it causes bleeding in the brain, known as a hemorrhagic stroke. Most often, a ruptured brain aneurysm occurs in the space between the brain and the thin tissues covering the brain. This type of hemorrhagic stroke is called a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Brain aneurysms are common. But most brain aneurysms aren't serious, especially if they're small. Most brain aneurysms don't rupture. They usually don't cause symptoms or cause health problems. In many cases, brain aneurysms are found during tests for other conditions. However, a ruptured aneurysm quickly becomes life-threatening and requires medical treatment right away. If a brain aneurysm hasn't ruptured, treatment may be appropriate in some cases. Treatment of an unruptured brain aneurysm may prevent a rupture in the future. Talk with your health care provider to make sure you understand the best options for your specific needs. Most brain aneurysms that haven't ruptured don't cause symptoms.

Broken heart syndrome,"Symptoms of broken heart syndrome can mimic those of a heart attack. Symptoms may include: Any continued chest pain could be due to a heart attack. Call 911 or your local emergency number if you have new or unexplained chest pain. Also call if you have a very rapid or irregular heartbeat or shortness of breath. The exact cause of broken heart syndrome is unclear. It's thought that a surge of stress hormones, such as adrenaline, might damage the hearts of some people for a short time. How these hormones might hurt the heart or whether something else is the cause isn't completely clear. A temporary squeezing of the large or small arteries of the heart may play a role in the development of broken heart syndrome. People who have broken heart syndrome also may have a change in the structure of the heart muscle. An intense physical or emotional event often comes before broken heart syndrome. Anything that causes a strong emotional reaction may trigger the condition. Examples include: Rarely, use of certain medicines or illegal drugs may lead to broken heart syndrome. They include: Always tell your healthcare team about the medicines you take, including those bought without a prescription. When starting a new medicine, talk to your care team about the potential risks and side effects. Heart attack is generally caused by a complete or near-complete blockage of a heart artery. In broken heart syndrome, the heart arteries are not blocked. But blood flow in the arteries of the heart may be reduced. Risk factors for broken heart syndrome include: Most people who have broken heart syndrome quickly recover and usually don't have long-lasting effects. But sometimes the condition comes back. This is called recurrent takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Rarely, broken heart syndrome can cause death. Complications of broken heart syndrome include: To prevent another episode of broken heart syndrome, many healthcare professionals recommend long-term treatment with beta blockers or similar medicines. These medicines block the potentially harmful effects of stress hormones on the heart. Having chronic stress may increase the risk of broken heart syndrome. Taking steps to manage emotional stress can improve heart health and may help prevent broken heart syndrome. Some ways to reduce and manage stress include: ","Broken heart syndrome is a heart condition that's often brought on by stressful situations and extreme emotions. The condition also can be triggered by a serious physical illness or surgery. Broken heart syndrome is usually temporary. But some people may continue to feel unwell after the heart is healed. People with broken heart syndrome may have sudden chest pain or think they're having a heart attack. Broken heart syndrome affects just part of the heart. It briefly interrupts the way the heart pumps blood. The rest of the heart continues to work as usual. Sometimes the heart contracts more forcefully.

Bulimia nervosa,"Bulimia symptoms may include: People with bulimia may use different methods to purge. The severity of bulimia depends on the number of times a week that you purge and the problems caused by doing so. If you have any bulimia symptoms, seek medical help right away. If left untreated, bulimia can severely affect your physical and mental health. Talk to your primary healthcare professional or a mental health professional about your bulimia symptoms and feelings. If you're not sure if you want to seek treatment, talk to someone about what you're going through. This could be a friend or loved one, a teacher, a faith leader, or someone else you trust. This person can help you take the first steps to get help. If you think a loved one may have symptoms of bulimia, talk with the person openly and honestly about your concerns. You can't force someone to get help, but you can give encouragement and support. You also can help find a healthcare professional or mental health professional, make an appointment, and even offer to go along to the appointment. People with bulimia can be at any weight. For example, they could be average weight or overweight. That's why you can't tell just by looking at someone's size whether that person has bulimia. Signs of bulimia that family and friends may notice include: The exact cause of bulimia is not known. Genes may play a role in the development of bulimia and other eating disorders. Emotional health and family history may play a role. Also, pressures from society to be thin may play a role. Females are more likely to have bulimia than males. Bulimia often begins in the late teens or young adulthood. Factors that raise your risk of bulimia include: Bulimia may cause many serious and even life-threatening complications, including: Conditions that often occur along with bulimia include anxiety, depression, personality disorders or bipolar disorder, and misuse of alcohol or drugs. Self-harm, thoughts about suicide or suicide also can occur. Although there's no sure way to prevent bulimia, you can steer someone toward healthier behavior or professional treatment before it gets worse. Here's how you can help: ","Bulimia (boo-LEE-me-uh) nervosa, commonly called bulimia, is a serious, potentially life-threatening eating disorder. People with bulimia binge eat. This means people feel like they've lost control over their eating. They eat large amounts of food in one sitting. This often occurs in secret, and they often feel very guilty and shameful. Then they try to get rid of the food and extra calories in an unhealthy way, such as vomiting or misusing laxatives. This is called purging. If you have bulimia, you probably focus on your weight and body shape even when you're trying to think about other things. You may judge yourself severely and harshly for what you see as flaws in your appearance and personality. Bulimia is related to how you see yourself — not just about food. It can be hard to overcome, and it can be dangerous. It's important to remember that an eating disorder is not something you choose. Bulimia is a complex illness that affects how your brain works and how you make decisions. But effective treatment can help you feel better about yourself, eat healthier and reverse serious complications. Bulimia symptoms may include: People with bulimia may use different methods to purge. The severity of bulimia depends on the number of times a week that you purge and the problems caused by doing so. If you have any bulimia symptoms, seek medical help right away. If left untreated, bulimia can severely affect your physical and mental health. Talk to your primary healthcare professional or a mental health professional about your bulimia symptoms and feelings. If you're not sure if you want to seek treatment, talk to someone about what you're going through. This could be a friend or loved one, a teacher, a faith leader, or someone else you trust. This person can help you take the first steps to get help. If you think a loved one may have symptoms of bulimia, talk with the person openly and honestly about your concerns. You can't force someone to get help, but you can give encouragement and support. You also can help find a healthcare professional or mental health professional, make an appointment, and even offer to go along to the appointment. People with bulimia can be at any weight. For example, they could be average weight or overweight. That's why you can't tell just by looking at someone's size whether that person has bulimia. Signs of bulimia that family and friends may notice include: The exact cause of bulimia is not known. Genes may play a role in the development of bulimia and other eating disorders. Emotional health and family history may play a role. Also, pressures from society to be thin may play a role. Females are more likely to have bulimia than males. Bulimia often begins in the late teens or young adulthood. Factors that raise your risk of bulimia include: Bulimia may cause many serious and even life-threatening complications, including: Conditions that often occur along with bulimia include anxiety, depression, personality disorders or bipolar disorder, and misuse of alcohol or drugs. Self-harm, thoughts about suicide or suicide also can occur. Although there's no sure way to prevent bulimia, you can steer someone toward healthier behavior or professional treatment before it gets worse. Here's how you can help: "
Calciphylaxis,"Calciphylaxis symptoms include: The exact cause of calciphylaxis isn't known. The disease involves the buildup of calcium in the smallest parts of the arteries in fat tissues and skin. Many people who get calciphylaxis also have kidney failure or receive dialysis. It's not known why people with kidney failure or people receiving dialysis are at higher risk of calciphylaxis. For some people, the calcium buildup in calciphylaxis is linked with small organs in the neck called parathyroid glands. If the glands release too many parathyroid hormones, that can cause calcium to collect. But the link isn't clear. Most people with seriously overactive parathyroid glands don't get calciphylaxis. And many people with kidney failure and calciphylaxis don't have overactive parathyroid glands. Other factors that seem to play roles in calciphylaxis include: Calciphylaxis most often affects people who have kidney failure. Other risk factors include: Complications of calciphylaxis include: Often, the outlook for people with calciphylaxis isn't hopeful. Finding and treating any infections early is key to preventing serious complications. There isn't a clear way to prevent calciphylaxis. But if you are on dialysis or have low kidney function due to advanced chronic kidney disease, it's important to keep blood levels of calcium and phosphorus under control. Keeping blood levels of phosphorus under control often is a challenge. Your healthcare professional might have you take medicines with meals. You also may need to restrict certain foods that are high in phosphorus. It's very important to follow your healthcare professional's directions and go to all follow-up healthcare checkups. If you have calciphylaxis, your healthcare team helps you prevent ulcer infections or other complications. You may need to apply special wound dressings or clean the ulcers daily to prevent germs called bacteria from growing.","Calciphylaxis (kal-sih-fuh-LAK-sis) is a rare, serious disease. It involves a buildup of calcium in small blood vessels of fat tissues and skin. Calciphylaxis symptoms include blood clots, lumps under the skin and painful open sores called ulcers. If an ulcer becomes infected, it can be life-threatening. The exact cause of calciphylaxis isn't clear. But people with the disease usually have kidney failure. That's a condition in which the kidneys no longer work as they should. Often, these same people also have received kidney failure treatments such as dialysis or a kidney transplant. Calciphylaxis can happen in people without kidney disease too. Calciphylaxis treatments include various medicines, procedures and surgery. Treatment can help prevent blood clots and infections, reduce calcium buildups, heal sores, and ease pain. Calciphylaxis symptoms include: The exact cause of calciphylaxis isn't known.

Cellulitis,"Cellulitis usually occurs on one side of the body. Its signs and symptoms may include:
It's important to identify and treat cellulitis early because the condition can spread rapidly throughout your body.
Seek emergency care if:
See your health care provider, preferably within the same day, if:","Cellulitis (sel-u-LIE-tis) is a common, potentially serious bacterial skin infection. The affected skin is swollen and inflamed and is typically painful and warm to the touch.
Cellulitis is usually a superficial infection of the skin (left). But if severe (right) or if left untreated, it can spread into the lymph nodes and bloodstream.
Cellulitis usually affects the lower legs, but it can occur on the face, arms and other areas. The infection happens when a break in the skin allows bacteria to enter.
Left untreated, the infection can spread to the lymph nodes and bloodstream and rapidly become life-threatening. It isn't usually spread from person to person."
Cerebral palsy,"Symptoms of cerebral palsy can vary greatly. In some people, cerebral palsy affects the whole body. In other people, symptoms might only affect one or two limbs or one side of the body. General symptoms include trouble with movement and coordination, speech and eating, development, and other issues. Movement and coordination symptoms may include: These symptoms related to speech and eating may occur: Some children with cerebral palsy have these symptoms related to development: Damage to the brain can contribute to other neurological symptoms, such as: The brain condition causing cerebral palsy doesn't change with time. Symptoms usually don't worsen with age. However, as the child gets older, some symptoms might become more or less clear. And muscle shortening and muscle rigidity can worsen if not treated aggressively. Contact your child's health care professional and get a prompt diagnosis if your child has symptoms of a movement condition. Also see a health professional if your child has delays in development. See your child's health care professional if you have concerns about episodes of loss of awareness or of irregular bodily movements or posture. It's also important to contact your child's health care professional if your child has trouble swallowing, poor coordination, eye muscle imbalance or other developmental issues. Cerebral palsy is caused by irregular brain development or damage to the developing brain. This usually happens before a child is born, but it can occur at birth or in early infancy. Often the cause isn't known. Many factors can lead to changes in brain development. Some include: A number of factors are associated with an increased risk of cerebral palsy. Certain infections or toxic exposures during pregnancy can significantly increase cerebral palsy risk to the baby. Inflammation triggered by infection or fever can damage the unborn baby's developing brain. Illnesses in a newborn baby that can greatly increase the risk of cerebral palsy include: The potential contribution from each is limited, but these pregnancy and birth factors may increase the risk of cerebral palsy risk: Muscle weakness, muscle spasticity and trouble with coordination can contribute to complications in childhood or in adulthood, including: Often cerebral palsy can't be prevented, but you can reduce risks. If you're pregnant or planning to become pregnant, take these steps to minimize pregnancy complications: Rarely, cerebral palsy can be caused by brain damage that occurs in childhood. Practice good general safety. Prevent head injuries by providing your child with a car seat, bicycle helmet, safety rails on the bed and appropriate supervision. ","Cerebral palsy is a group of conditions that affect movement and posture. It's caused by damage that occurs to the developing brain, most often before birth. Symptoms appear during infancy or preschool years and vary from very mild to serious. Children with cerebral palsy may have exaggerated reflexes. The arms, legs and trunk may appear floppy. Or they may have stiff muscles, known as spasticity. Symptoms also can include irregular posture, movements that can't be controlled, a walk that's not steady or some combination of these. Cerebral palsy may make it hard to swallow. It also can cause eye muscle imbalance, in which the eyes don't focus on the same object. People with the condition might have reduced range of motion in their joints due to muscle stiffness. The cause of cerebral palsy and its effect on function vary from person to person. Some people with cerebral palsy can walk while others need assistance. Some people have intellectual disabilities, but others do not. Epilepsy, blindness or deafness also might affect some people with cerebral palsy. There is no cure, but treatments can help improve function. The symptoms of cerebral palsy may vary during the child's development, but the condition doesn't get worse. The condition generally stays the same over time. Symptoms of cerebral palsy can vary greatly. In some people, cerebral palsy affects the whole body. In other people, symptoms might only affect one or two limbs or one side of the body.

Cervical cancer,"When it starts, cervical cancer might not cause symptoms. As it grows, cervical cancer might cause signs and symptoms, such as: Make an appointment with a doctor or other health care professional if you have any symptoms that worry you. Cervical cancer begins when healthy cells in the cervix develop changes in theirDNA. A cell'sDNAcontains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The changes tell the cells to multiply quickly. The cells continue living when healthy cells would die as part of their natural life cycle. This causes too many cells. The cells might form a mass called a tumor. The cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, the cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. Most cervical cancers are caused byHPV.HPVis a common virus that's passed through sexual contact. For most people, the virus never causes problems. It usually goes away on its own. For some, though, the virus can cause changes in the cells that may lead to cancer. Cervical cancer is divided into types based on the type of cell in which the cancer begins. The main types of cervical cancer are: Sometimes, both types of cells are involved in cervical cancer. Very rarely, cancer occurs in other cells in the cervix. Risk factors for cervical cancer include: To reduce your risk of cervical cancer: ","Cervical cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. Various strains of the human papillomavirus, also called HPV, play a role in causing most cervical cancers.HPVis a common infection that's passed through sexual contact. When exposed toHPV, the body's immune system typically prevents the virus from doing harm. In a small percentage of people, however, the virus survives for years. This contributes to the process that causes some cervical cells to become cancer cells. You can reduce your risk of developing cervical cancer by having screening tests and receiving a vaccine that protects againstHPVinfection. When cervical cancer happens, it's often first treated with surgery to remove the cancer. Other treatments may include medicines to kill the cancer cells. Options might include chemotherapy and targeted therapy medicines. Radiation therapy with powerful energy beams also may be used. Sometimes treatment combines radiation with low-dose chemotherapy. When it starts, cervical cancer might not cause symptoms.

Chickenpox,"The rash caused by chickenpox appears 10 to 21 days after you're exposed to the varicella-zoster virus. The rash often lasts about 5 to 10 days. Other symptoms that may appear 1 to 2 days before the rash include: Once the chickenpox rash appears, it goes through three phases: New bumps keep showing up for several days. So you may have bumps, blisters and scabs at the same time. You can spread the virus to other people for up to 48 hours before the rash appears. And the virus stays contagious until all broken blisters have crusted over. The disease is by and large mild in healthy children. But sometimes, the rash can cover the whole body. Blisters may form in the throat and eyes. They also may form in tissue that lines the inside of the urethra, anus and vagina. If you think you or your child might have chickenpox, call your health care provider. Often, chickenpox can be diagnosed with an exam of the rash and other symptoms. You may need medicines that can help fight off the virus or treat other health problems that can happen because of chickenpox. To avoid infecting others in the waiting room, call ahead for an appointment. Mention that you think you or your child may have chickenpox. Also, let your provider know if: A virus called varicella-zoster causes chickenpox. It can spread through direct contact with the rash. It also can spread when a person with chickenpox coughs or sneezes and you breathe in the air droplets. Your risk of getting infected with the virus that causes chickenpox is higher if you haven't already had chickenpox or if you haven't had the chickenpox vaccine. It's extra important for people who work in child care or school settings to be vaccinated. Most people who have had chickenpox or have gotten the vaccine are immune to chickenpox. If you've been vaccinated and still get chickenpox, symptoms are often milder. You may have fewer blisters and mild or no fever. A few people can get chickenpox more than once, but this is rare. Chickenpox is often a mild disease. But it can be serious and can lead to other health problem including: In very rare cases, chickenpox could lead to death. People who are at higher risk of chickenpox complications include: Low birth weight and limb problems are more common in babies born to women who are infected with chickenpox early in their pregnancies. When a pregnant person catches chickenpox in the week before birth or within a couple of days after giving birth, the baby has a higher risk of getting a life-threatening infection. If you're pregnant and not immune to chickenpox, talk to your health care provider about these risks. If you've had chickenpox, you're at risk of a complication called shingles. The varicella-zoster virus stays in your nerve cells after the chickenpox rash goes away. Many years later, the virus can turn back on and cause shingles, a painful cluster of blisters. The virus is more likely to come back in older adults and people who have weaker immune systems. The pain of shingles can last long after the blisters go away, and it can be serious. This is called postherpetic neuralgia. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests you get the shingles vaccine, Shingrix, if you're 50 or older. The agency also suggests Shingrix if you're 19 or older and you have a weaker immune system because of diseases or treatments. Shingrix is recommended even if you've already had shingles or you've gotten the older shingles vaccine, Zostavax. Other shingles vaccines are offered outside of the United States. Talk to your provider for more information on how well they prevent shingles. The chickenpox vaccine, also called the varicella vaccine, is the best way to prevent chickenpox. In the United States, experts from theCDCreport that two doses of the vaccine prevent illness over 90% of the time. Even if you get chickenpox after receiving the vaccine, your symptoms may be much milder. In the United States, two chickenpox vaccines are licensed for use: Varivax contains only the chickenpox vaccine. It can be used in the United States to vaccinate people age 1 or older. ProQuad combines the chickenpox vaccine with the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. It can be used in the United States for children ages 1 to 12. This is also called the MMRV vaccine. In the United States, children receive two doses of the varicella vaccine: the first between ages 12 and 15 months and the second between ages 4 and 6 years. This is part of the routine vaccination schedule for children. For some children between the ages of 12 and 23 months, the MMRV combination vaccine may raise the risk of fever and seizure from the vaccine. Ask your child's health care provider about the pros and cons of using the combined vaccines. Children 7 to 12 years old who haven't been vaccinated should receive two doses of the varicella vaccine. The doses should be given at least three months apart. People age 13 or older who haven't been vaccinated should receive two catch-up doses of the vaccine at least four weeks apart. It's even more important to get the vaccine if you have a higher risk of getting exposed to chickenpox. This includes health care workers, teachers, child-care employees, international travelers, military personnel, adults who live with young children and all nonpregnant women of childbearing age. If you don't remember whether you've had chickenpox or the vaccine, your provider can give you a blood test to find out. Other chickenpox vaccines are offered outside the United States. Talk to your health care provider for more information on how well they prevent chickenpox. Do not get the chickenpox vaccine if you're pregnant. If you decide to get vaccinated before pregnancy, don't try to get pregnant during the series of shots or for one month after the last dose of the vaccine. Other people also shouldn't get the vaccine, or they should wait. Check with your health care provider about whether you should get the vaccine if you: Talk to your provider if you're not sure whether you need the vaccine. If you plan on getting pregnant, ask your provider if you're up to date on your vaccines. Parents often wonder whether vaccines are safe. Since the chickenpox vaccine became available, studies have found that it's safe and it works well. Side effects are often mild. They include pain, redness, soreness and swelling at the site of the shot. Rarely, you might get a rash at the site or a fever. ","Chickenpox is an illness caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It brings on an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters. Chickenpox spreads very easily to people who haven't had the disease or haven't gotten the chickenpox vaccine. Chickenpox used to be a widespread problem, but today the vaccine protects children from it. The chickenpox vaccine is a safe way to prevent this illness and the other health problems that can happen during it.

Make an appointment with your healthcare professional if you have symptoms that worry you. If your belly pain is so bad that you can't sit still or get comfortable, have someone drive you to the emergency room. Cholecystitis is when your gallbladder is inflamed. Gallbladder inflammation can be caused by: Having gallstones is the main risk factor for getting cholecystitis. If not treated, cholecystitis can lead to serious complications, including: You can reduce your risk of cholecystitis by taking the following steps to prevent gallstones: ","Cholecystitis (ko-luh-sis-TIE-tis) is swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ on the right side of the belly under the liver. The gallbladder holds fluid that digests food. This fluid is called bile. The gallbladder releases bile into the small intestine. Most often, gallstones that block the tube leading out of the gallbladder cause cholecystitis. This results in a bile buildup that can cause inflammation. Other causes of cholecystitis include bile duct changes, tumors, serious illness and certain infections. If not treated, cholecystitis can lead to serious complications, such as gallbladder rupture. These can be life-threatening. Treatment for cholecystitis often involves surgery to remove the gallbladder. Symptoms of cholecystitis may include: Cholecystitis symptoms often come on after a meal.

When they occur, signs and symptoms of chondrosarcoma may include: It's not clear what causes chondrosarcoma. Doctors know that cancer begins when a cell develops changes (mutations) in its DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell it what to do. The instructions tell the cell to multiply quickly and to continue living when healthy cells would die. The accumulating cells form a tumor that can grow to invade and destroy normal body tissue. In time, cells can break away and spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body. Factors that can increase the risk of chondrosarcoma include: ","Chondrosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that usually begins in the bones, but can sometimes occur in the soft tissue near bones. Chondrosarcoma happens most often in the pelvis, hip and shoulder. More rarely, it can happen in the bones of the spine. Most chondrosarcomas grow slowly and may not cause many signs and symptoms at first. Some rare types grow rapidly and have a high risk of spreading to other areas of the body, which can make these cancers difficult to treat. Chondrosarcoma treatment usually involves surgery.

Chronic kidney disease,"Signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease develop over time if kidney damage progresses slowly. Loss of kidney function can cause a buildup of fluid or body waste or electrolyte problems. Depending on how severe it is, loss of kidney function can cause: Signs and symptoms of kidney disease are often nonspecific. This means they can also be caused by other illnesses. Because your kidneys are able to make up for lost function, you might not develop signs and symptoms until irreversible damage has occurred. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of kidney disease. Early detection might help prevent kidney disease from progressing to kidney failure. If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, your doctor may monitor your blood pressure and kidney function with urine and blood tests during office visits. Ask your doctor whether these tests are necessary for you. Chronic kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition impairs kidney function, causing kidney damage to worsen over several months or years. Diseases and conditions that cause chronic kidney disease include: Factors that can increase your risk of chronic kidney disease include: Chronic kidney disease can affect almost every part of your body. Potential complications include: To reduce your risk of developing kidney disease: ","Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, involves a gradual loss of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then removed in your urine. Advanced chronic kidney disease can cause dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes to build up in your body. In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you might have few signs or symptoms. You might not realize that you have kidney disease until the condition is advanced. Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of kidney damage, usually by controlling the cause. But, even controlling the cause might not keep kidney damage from progressing. Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant. Signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease develop over time if kidney damage progresses slowly. Loss of kidney function can cause a buildup of fluid or body waste or electrolyte problems. Depending on how severe it is, loss of kidney function can cause: Signs and symptoms of kidney disease are often nonspecific. This means they can also be caused by other illnesses. Because your kidneys are able to make up for lost function, you might not develop signs and symptoms until irreversible damage has occurred. Make an appointment with your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of kidney disease. Early detection might help prevent kidney disease from progressing to kidney failure. If you have a medical condition that increases your risk of kidney disease, your doctor may monitor your blood pressure and kidney function with urine and blood tests during office visits. Ask your doctor whether these tests are necessary for you. Chronic kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition impairs kidney function, causing kidney damage to worsen over several months or years. Diseases and conditions that cause chronic kidney disease include: Factors that can increase your risk of chronic kidney disease include: Chronic kidney disease can affect almost every part of your body. Potential complications include: To reduce your risk of developing kidney disease: "
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia,"Many people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia have no symptoms at first. Signs and symptoms might develop as the cancer progresses. They might include: Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs and symptoms that worry you. Doctors aren't certain what starts the process that causes chronic lymphocytic leukemia. What's known is that something happens to cause changes (mutations) in the DNA of blood-producing cells. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell the cell what to do. The changes tell the blood cells to produce abnormal, ineffective lymphocytes. Beyond being ineffective, these abnormal lymphocytes continue to live and multiply when healthy lymphocytes would die. The abnormal lymphocytes accumulate in the blood and certain organs, where they cause complications. They may crowd healthy cells out of the bone marrow and interfere with blood cell production. Doctors and researchers are working to understand the exact mechanism that causes chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Factors that may increase the risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia include: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia may cause complications such as: ","Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow — the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made. The term ""chronic"" in chronic lymphocytic leukemia comes from the fact that this leukemia typically progresses more slowly than other types of leukemia. The term ""lymphocytic"" in chronic lymphocytic leukemia comes from the cells affected by the disease — a group of white blood cells called lymphocytes, which help your body fight infection. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia most commonly affects older adults. There are treatments to help control the disease. Many people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia have no symptoms at first.

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy,"There are no specific symptoms that have been clearly linked toCTE. Some of the possible symptoms can occur in many other conditions. In the people who were confirmed to haveCTEat autopsy, symptoms have included cognitive, behavioral, mood and motor changes. CTEsymptoms don't develop right after a head injury. Experts believe that they develop over years or decades after repeated head trauma. Experts also believe thatCTEsymptoms appear in two forms. In early life between the late 20s and early 30s, the first form ofCTEmay cause mental health and behavioral issues. Symptoms of this form include depression, anxiety, impulsive behavior and aggression. The second form ofCTEis thought to cause symptoms later in life, around age 60. These symptoms include memory and thinking problems that are likely to progress to dementia. The full list of signs to look for in people withCTEat autopsy is still unknown. There's also little known about howCTEprogresses. CTEis thought to develop over many years after repeated brain injuries that may be mild or severe. See your health care provider in these situations: Repeated head trauma is likely the cause ofCTE. Football players in the United States, ice hockey players and military members serving in war zones have been the focus of mostCTEstudies. However, other sports and factors such as physical abuse also can lead to repeated head injuries. A head injury can cause a concussion, which may cause headaches, problems with memory and other symptoms. Not everyone who experiences repeated concussions, including athletes and military members, go on to developCTE.

The current recommendation to preventCTEis to reduce mild traumatic brain injuries and to prevent additional injury after a concussion. ","Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a brain disorder likely caused by repeated head injuries. It causes the death of nerve cells in the brain, known as degeneration.CTEgets worse over time. The only way to definitively diagnosisCTEis after death during an autopsy of the brain. CTEis a rare disorder that is not yet well understood.CTEdoesn't appear to be related to a single head injury. It's related to repeated head injuries, often occurring in contact sports or military combat. The development ofCTEhas been associated with second impact syndrome, in which a second head injury happens before previous head injury symptoms have fully resolved. Experts are still trying to understand how repeated head injuries and other factors might contribute to the changes in the brain that result inCTE. Researchers are looking into how the number of head injuries someone experiences and how bad the injuries are may affect risk ofCTE. CTEhas been found in the brains of people who played U.S. football and other contact sports, including boxing. It also may occur in military members who were exposed to explosive blasts. Symptoms ofCTEare thought to include trouble with thinking and emotions, physical problems, and other behaviors. It's thought that these develop years to decades after head trauma occurs. CTEcan't be definitively diagnosed during life except in people with high-risk exposures. Researchers are currently developing diagnostic biomarkers forCTE, but none has been validated yet. When the symptoms associated withCTEoccur, health care providers may diagnose traumatic encephalopathy syndrome. Experts don't yet know how oftenCTEoccurs in the population, but it appears to be rare. They also don't fully understand the causes. There is no cure forCTE.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection,"Most healthy people who are infected withCMVmay experience no symptoms. Some experience minor symptoms. People who are more likely to experience signs and symptoms ofCMVinclude:
Most babies who have congenitalCMVappear healthy at birth.
A few babies who have congenitalCMVwho appear healthy at birth develop signs over time — sometimes not for months or years after birth. The most common of these late-occurring signs are hearing loss and developmental delay. A small number of babies may also develop vision problems.
The following signs and symptoms are more common in babies who have congenitalCMVand who are sick at birth:
If your immune system is weakened, you might experience serious problems that affect your:
Most people who are infected withCMVwho are otherwise healthy experience few if any symptoms. When first infected, some adults may have symptoms similar to infectious mononucleosis, including:
See your doctor if:
If you haveCMVbut are otherwise healthy, and you're experiencing any mild, generalized illness, you could be in a reactivation period. Self-care, such as getting plenty of rest, should be enough for your body to control the infection.
If you know you were infected withCMVduring your pregnancy, tell your baby's doctor. The doctor will likely assess your baby for hearing or vision problems.","Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus. Once infected, your body retains the virus for life. Most people don't know they have cytomegalovirus (CMV) because it rarely causes problems in healthy people.
If you're pregnant or if your immune system is weakened,CMVis cause for concern. Women who develop an activeCMVinfection during pregnancy can pass the virus to their babies, who might then experience symptoms. For people who have weakened immune systems, especially people who have had an organ, stem cell or bone marrow transplant,CMVinfection can be fatal.
CMVspreads from person to person through body fluids, such as blood, saliva, urine, semen and breast milk. There is no cure, but there are medications that can help treat the symptoms."
Cold urticaria,"Cold urticaria signs and symptoms may include:
Severe reactions may include:
Cold urticaria symptoms begin soon after the skin is exposed to a sudden drop in air temperature or to cold water. Damp and windy conditions may make a flare of symptoms more likely. Each episode may persist for about two hours.
The worst reactions generally occur with full skin exposure, such as swimming in cold water. Such a reaction could lead to loss of consciousness and drowning.
If you have skin reactions after cold exposure, see your doctor. Even if the reactions are mild, your doctor will want to rule out underlying conditions that may be causing the problem.
Seek emergency care if after sudden exposure to cold you experience a whole-body response (anaphylaxis) or difficulty breathing.","Cold urticaria (ur-tih-KAR-e-uh) is a skin reaction to cold that appears within minutes after cold exposure. Affected skin develops itchy welts (hives).
People with cold urticaria experience widely different symptoms. Some have minor reactions to the cold, while others have severe reactions. For some people with this condition, swimming in cold water could lead to very low blood pressure, fainting or shock.
Cold urticaria occurs most frequently in young adults. If you think you have this condition, consult your doctor. Treatment usually includes preventive steps such as taking antihistamines and avoiding cold air and water."
Colon cancer,"Many people with colon cancer don't have symptoms at first. When symptoms appear, they'll likely depend on the cancer's size and where it is in the large intestine. Symptoms of colon cancer can include: If you notice lasting symptoms that worry you, make an appointment with a health care professional. Doctors aren't certain what causes most colon cancers. Colon cancer happens when cells in the colon develop changes in their DNA. A cells' DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. The changes tell the cells to multiply quickly. The changes let the cells continue living when healthy cells die as part of their natural lifecycle. This causes too many cells. The cells might form a mass called a tumor. The cells can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, the cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. Factors that may increase the risk of colon cancer include: Doctors recommend that people with an average risk of colon cancer consider starting colon cancer screening around age 45. But people with an increased risk should think about starting screening sooner. People with an increased risk include those with a family history of colon cancer. There are several different tests that are used for colon cancer screening. Talk about your options with your health care team. Making changes in everyday life can reduce the risk of colon cancer. To lower the risk of colon cancer: Some medicines can reduce the risk of colon polyps or colon cancer. For instance, some evidence links a reduced risk of polyps and colon cancer to regular use of aspirin or aspirin-like medicines. But it's not clear what dose and what length of time would be needed to reduce the risk of colon cancer. Taking aspirin daily has some risks, including ulcers and bleeding in the digestive system. These options are generally reserved for people with a high risk of colon cancer. There isn't enough evidence to recommend these medicines to people who have an average risk of colon cancer. If you have an increased risk of colon cancer, discuss your risk factors with your health care team to see if preventive medicines are safe for you. ","Colon cancer is a growth of cells that begins in a part of the large intestine called the colon. The colon is the first and longest part of the large intestine. The large intestine is the last part of the digestive system. The digestive system breaks down food for the body to use. Colon cancer typically affects older adults, though it can happen at any age. It usually begins as small clumps of cells called polyps that form inside the colon. Polyps generally aren't cancerous, but some can turn into colon cancers over time. Polyps often don't cause symptoms. For this reason, doctors recommend regular screening tests to look for polyps in the colon. Finding and removing polyps helps prevent colon cancer. If colon cancer develops, many treatments can help control it. Treatments include surgery, radiation therapy and medicines, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Colon cancer is sometimes called colorectal cancer. This term combines colon cancer and rectal cancer, which begins in the rectum. Many people with colon cancer don't have symptoms at first. When symptoms appear, they'll likely depend on the cancer's size and where it is in the large intestine.

Complex regional pain syndrome,"Signs and symptoms ofCRPSinclude:
Symptoms may change over time and vary from person to person. Pain, swelling, redness, noticeable changes in temperature and hypersensitivity (particularly to cold and touch) usually occur first.
Over time, the affected limb can become cold and pale. It may undergo skin and nail changes as well as muscle spasms and tightening. Once these changes occur, the condition is often irreversible.
CRPSoccasionally may spread from its source to elsewhere in the body, such as the opposite limb.
In some people, signs and symptoms ofCRPSgo away on their own. In others, signs and symptoms may persist for months to years. Treatment is likely to be most effective when started early in the course of the illness.
If you experience constant, severe pain that affects a limb and makes touching or moving that limb seem intolerable, see your health care provider to determine the cause. It's important to treatCRPSearly.","Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a form of chronic pain that usually affects an arm or a leg. complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) typically develops after an injury, a surgery, a stroke or a heart attack. The pain is out of proportion to the severity of the initial injury.
CRPSis uncommon, and its cause isn't clearly understood. Treatment is most effective when started early. In such cases, improvement and even remission are possible."
Dermatitis,"Each type of dermatitis tends to occur on a different part of the body. Symptoms may include: See your doctor if: Seek immediate medical attention ifyou have a fever and the rash looks infected. A common cause of dermatitis is contact with something that irritates your skin or triggers an allergic reaction. Examples of such things are poison ivy, perfume, lotion and jewelry containing nickel. Other causes of dermatitis include dry skin, a viral infection, bacteria, stress, genetic makeup and a problem with the immune system. Common risk factors for dermatitis include: Repeated scratching that breaks the skin can cause open sores and cracks. These increase the risk of infection from bacteria and fungi. These skin infections can spread and become life-threatening, though this is rare. In people with brown and Black skin, dermatitis might cause the affected skin to darken or lighten. These conditions are called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and post-inflammatory hypopigmentation. It might take months or years for the skin to return to its usual color. Wear protective clothing if you're doing a task that involves irritants or caustic chemicals. Developing a basic skin care routine also may help prevent dermatitis. The following habits can help reduce the drying effects of bathing: ","Dermatitis is a common condition that causes swelling and irritation of the skin. It has many causes and forms and often involves itchy, dry skin or a rash. Or it might cause the skin to blister, ooze, crust or flake. Three common types of this condition are atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis is also known as eczema. Dermatitis isn't contagious, but it can be very uncomfortable. Moisturizing regularly helps control the symptoms. Treatment also may include medicated ointments, creams and shampoos.

Ectopic pregnancy,"You may not notice any symptoms at first. However, some women who have an ectopic pregnancy have the usual early signs or symptoms of pregnancy — a missed period, breast tenderness and nausea.
If you take a pregnancy test, the result will be positive. Still, an ectopic pregnancy can't continue as normal.
As the fertilized egg grows in the improper place, signs and symptoms become more noticeable.
Often, the first warning signs of an ectopic pregnancy are light vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain.
If blood leaks from the fallopian tube, you may feel shoulder pain or an urge to have a bowel movement. Your specific symptoms depend on where the blood collects and which nerves are irritated.
If the fertilized egg continues to grow in the fallopian tube, it can cause the tube to rupture. Heavy bleeding inside the abdomen is likely. Symptoms of this life-threatening event include extreme lightheadedness, fainting and shock.
Seek emergency medical help if you have any signs or symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy, including:","Pregnancy begins with a fertilized egg. Normally, the fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus. An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants and grows outside the main cavity of the uterus.
An ectopic pregnancy most often occurs in a fallopian tube, which carries eggs from the ovaries to the uterus. This type of ectopic pregnancy is called a tubal pregnancy. Sometimes, an ectopic pregnancy occurs in other areas of the body, such as the ovary, abdominal cavity or the lower part of the uterus (cervix), which connects to the vagina.
An ectopic pregnancy can't proceed normally. The fertilized egg can't survive, and the growing tissue may cause life-threatening bleeding, if left untreated.
In a healthy pregnancy, the fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining of the uterus. In an ectopic pregnancy, the egg attaches itself somewhere outside the uterus usually to the inside of a fallopian tube."
Edema,"Symptoms of edema include: Make an appointment to see a health care provider for swelling, stretched or shiny skin, or skin that holds a dimple after being pressed. See a provider right away for: These can be signs of fluid buildup in the lungs, also known as pulmonary edema. It can be life-threatening and needs quick treatment. After sitting for a long time, such as on a long flight, call your care provider if you get leg pain and swelling that won't go away. Especially if the pain and swelling is on one side, these can be symptoms of a blood clot deep in the vein, also known as deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. Edema occurs when tiny blood vessels in the body, also known as capillaries, leak fluid. The fluid builds up in nearby tissues. The leak leads to swelling. Causes of mild cases of edema include: Edema also can be a side effect of some medicines. These include: Sometimes edema can be a sign of a more serious condition. Illnesses that can cause edema include: The following increases the risk of edema: If left untreated, edema can cause: ","Edema is swelling caused by too much fluid trapped in the body's tissues. Edema can affect any part of the body. But it's more likely to show up in the legs and feet. Medicines and pregnancy can cause edema. It also can be the result of a disease, such as congestive heart failure, kidney disease, venous insufficiency or cirrhosis of the liver. Wearing compression garments and reducing salt in the diet often relieves edema. When a disease causes edema, the disease needs treatment, as well.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,"There are many different types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but the most common signs and symptoms include: Symptom severity can vary from person to person and depends on the specific type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that you have. The most common type is called hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome often share distinctive facial features of a thin nose, thin upper lip, small earlobes and prominent eyes. They also have thin, translucent skin that bruises very easily. In fair-skinned people, the underlying blood vessels are very visible through the skin. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can weaken your heart's largest artery (aorta), as well as the arteries to other regions of your body. A rupture of any of these larger blood vessels can be fatal. The vascular type can also weaken the walls of the uterus or large intestines — which also may rupture. Different types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are associated with a variety of genetic causes, some of which are inherited and passed on from parent to child. If you have the most common form, hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, there's a 50% chance that you'll pass on the gene to each of your children. Complications depend on the types of signs and symptoms you have. For example, overly flexible joints can result in joint dislocations and early-onset arthritis. Fragile skin may develop prominent scarring. People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are at risk of often fatal ruptures of major blood vessels. Some organs, such as the uterus and intestines, also may rupture. Pregnancy can increase the risk of a rupture in the uterus. If you have a personal or family history of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and you're thinking about starting a family, you may benefit from talking to a genetic counselor — a health care professional trained to assess the risk of inherited disorders. Genetic counseling can help you understand the inheritance pattern of the type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that affects you and the risks it poses for your children. ","Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of inherited disorders that affect your connective tissues — primarily your skin, joints and blood vessel walls. Connective tissue is a complex mixture of proteins and other substances that provide strength and elasticity to the underlying structures in your body. People who have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome usually have overly flexible joints and stretchy, fragile skin. This can become a problem if you have a wound that requires stitches, because the skin often isn't strong enough to hold them. A more severe form of the disorder, called vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, can cause the walls of your blood vessels, intestines or uterus to rupture. Because vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can have serious potential complications in pregnancy, you may want to talk to a genetic counselor before starting a family. There are many different types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but the most common signs and symptoms include: Symptom severity can vary from person to person and depends on the specific type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that you have. The most common type is called hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome often share distinctive facial features of a thin nose, thin upper lip, small earlobes and prominent eyes. They also have thin, translucent skin that bruises very easily. In fair-skinned people, the underlying blood vessels are very visible through the skin. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can weaken your heart's largest artery (aorta), as well as the arteries to other regions of your body. A rupture of any of these larger blood vessels can be fatal. The vascular type can also weaken the walls of the uterus or large intestines — which also may rupture.

Encephalitis,"Encephalitis may cause many different symptoms including confusion, personality changes, seizures or trouble with movement. Encephalitis also may cause changes in sight or hearing. Most people with infectious encephalitis have flu-like symptoms, such as: Typically, these are followed by more-serious symptoms over a period of hours to days, such as: In infants and young children, symptoms also might include: In autoimmune encephalitis, symptoms may develop more slowly over several weeks. Flu-like symptoms are less common but can sometimes happen weeks before more-serious symptoms start. Symptoms are different for everyone, but it's common for people to have a combination of symptoms, including: Get medical care right away if you experience any of the more-serious symptoms associated with encephalitis. A bad headache, fever and change in consciousness require urgent care. Infants and young children with any symptoms of encephalitis also need urgent care. In about half of patients, the exact cause of encephalitis is not known. In those for whom a cause is found, there are two main types of encephalitis: The viruses that can cause encephalitis include: Anyone can develop encephalitis. Factors that may increase the risk include: The complications of encephalitis vary, depending on factors such as: People with relatively mild illness usually recover within a few weeks with no long-term complications. Inflammation can injure the brain, possibly resulting in a coma or death. Other complications may last for months or may be permanent. Complications can vary widely and can include: The best way to prevent viral encephalitis is to take precautions to avoid exposure to viruses that can cause the disease. Try to: To minimize your exposure to mosquitoes and ticks: Insect repellents aren't recommended for use on infants younger than 2 months of age. Instead, cover an infant carrier or stroller with mosquito netting. For older infants and children, repellents with 10% to 30% DEET are considered safe. Products containing both DEET and sunscreen aren't recommended for children. This is because reapplying for sunscreen protection can expose the child to too much DEET. Tips for using mosquito repellent with children include:","Encephalitis (en-sef-uh-LIE-tis) is inflammation of the brain. It can be caused by viral or bacterial infections, or by immune cells mistakenly attacking the brain. Viruses that can lead to encephalitis can be spread by insects such as mosquitos and ticks. When inflammation is caused by an infection in the brain, it's known as infectious encephalitis. And when it's caused by the immune system attacking the brain, it's known as autoimmune encephalitis. Sometimes there is no known cause. Encephalitis can sometimes lead to death.

Endocarditis,"Symptoms of endocarditis can vary from person to person. Endocarditis may develop slowly or suddenly. It depends on the type of germs causing the infection and whether there are other heart problems.
Common symptoms of endocarditis include:
Less common endocarditis symptoms can include:
If you have symptoms of endocarditis, see your health care provider as soon as possible — especially if you have a congenital heart defect or history of endocarditis. Less serious conditions may cause similar signs and symptoms. A proper evaluation by a health care provider is needed to make the diagnosis.
If you've been diagnosed with endocarditis and have any of the following symptoms, tell your care provider. These symptoms may mean the infection is getting worse:","Endocarditis is a life-threatening inflammation of the inner lining of the heart's chambers and valves. This lining is called the endocardium.
Endocarditis is usually caused by an infection. Bacteria, fungi or other germs get into the bloodstream and attach to damaged areas in the heart. Things that make you more likely to get endocarditis are artificial heart valves, damaged heart valves or other heart defects.
Without quick treatment, endocarditis can damage or destroy the heart valves. Treatments for endocarditis include medications and surgery.
Endocarditis occurs when bacteria or other germs enter the bloodstream and travel to the heart. The germs then stick to damaged heart valves or damaged heart tissue."
Endometriosis,"The main symptom of endometriosis is pelvic pain. It's often linked with menstrual periods. Although many people have cramping during their periods, those with endometriosis often describe menstrual pain that's far worse than usual. The pain also may become worse over time. Common symptoms of endometriosis include: The seriousness of your pain may not be a sign of the number or extent of endometriosis growths in your body. You could have a small amount of tissue with bad pain. Or you could have lots of endometriosis tissue with little or no pain. Still, some people with endometriosis have no symptoms. Often, they find out they have the condition when they can't get pregnant or after they get surgery for another reason. For those with symptoms, endometriosis sometimes may seem like other conditions that can cause pelvic pain. These include pelvic inflammatory disease or ovarian cysts. Or it may be confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which causes bouts of diarrhea, constipation and stomach cramps. IBS also can happen along with endometriosis. This makes it harder for your health care team to find the exact cause of your symptoms. See a member of your health care team if you think you might have symptoms of endometriosis. Endometriosis can be a challenge to manage. You may be better able to take charge of the symptoms if: The exact cause of endometriosis isn't clear. But some possible causes include: Factors that raise the risk of endometriosis include: Any health condition that prevents blood from flowing out of the body during menstrual periods also can be an endometriosis risk factor. So can conditions of the reproductive tract. Endometriosis symptoms often happen years after menstruation starts. The symptoms may get better for a time with pregnancy. Pain may become milder over time with menopause, unless you take estrogen therapy. The main complication of endometriosis is trouble getting pregnant, also called infertility. Up to half of people with endometriosis have a hard time conceiving. For pregnancy to happen, an egg must be released from an ovary. Then the egg has to travel through the fallopian tube and become fertilized by a sperm cell. The fertilized egg then needs to attach itself to the wall of the uterus to start developing. Endometriosis may block the tube and keep the egg and sperm from uniting. But the condition also seems to affect fertility in less-direct ways. For instance, it may damage the sperm or egg. Even so, many with mild to moderate endometriosis can still conceive and carry a pregnancy to term. Health care professionals sometimes advise those with endometriosis not to delay having children. That's because the condition may become worse with time. Some studies suggest that endometriosis raises the risk of ovarian cancer. But the overall lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is low to begin with. And it stays fairly low in people with endometriosis. Although rare, another type of cancer called endometriosis-associated adenocarcinoma can happen later in life in those who've had endometriosis. ","Endometriosis (en-doe-me-tree-O-sis) is an often-painful condition in which tissue that is similar to the inner lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. It often affects the ovaries, fallopian tubes and the tissue lining the pelvis. Rarely, endometriosis growths may be found beyond the area where pelvic organs are located. Endometriosis tissue acts as the lining inside the uterus would — it thickens, breaks down and bleeds with each menstrual cycle. But it grows in places where it doesn't belong, and it doesn't leave the body. When endometriosis involves the ovaries, cysts called endometriomas may form. Surrounding tissue can become irritated and form scar tissue. Bands of fibrous tissue called adhesions also may form. These can cause pelvic tissues and organs to stick to each other. Endometriosis can cause pain, especially during menstrual periods. Fertility problems also may develop. But treatments can help you take charge of the condition and its complications.

Epilepsy,"Seizure symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. Because epilepsy is caused by certain activity in the brain, seizures can affect any brain process. Seizure symptoms may include: Sometimes people with epilepsy may have changes in their behavior. They also may have symptoms of psychosis. Most people with epilepsy tend to have the same type of seizure each time. Symptoms are usually similar from episode to episode. Some people with focal seizures have warning signs in the moments before a seizure begins. These warning signs are known as aura. Warning signs might include a feeling in the stomach. Or they might include emotions such as fear. Some people might feel deja vu. Auras also might be a taste or a smell. They might even be visual, such as a steady or flashing light, a color, or a shape. Some people may experience dizziness and loss of balance. And some people may see things that aren't there, known as hallucinations. Seizures are classified as either focal or generalized, based on how and where the brain activity causing the seizure begins. When seizures appear to result from activity in just one area of the brain, they're called focal seizures. These seizures fall into two categories: Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological conditions, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough exam and testing are needed to tell if symptoms are the result of epilepsy or another condition. Focal seizures may come from any lobe of the brain. Some types of focal seizures include: Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Generalized seizures include: Seek immediate medical help if any of the following occurs with a seizure: If you have a seizure for the first time, seek medical advice. Epilepsy has no identifiable cause in about half the people with the condition. In the other half, the condition may be traced to various factors, including: Seizures can be triggered by things in the environment. Seizure triggers don't cause epilepsy, but they may trigger seizures in people who have epilepsy. Most people with epilepsy don't have reliable triggers that always cause a seizure. However, they often can identify factors that make it easier to have a seizure. Possible seizure triggers include: Certain factors may increase your risk of epilepsy: Having a seizure at certain times can be dangerous to yourself or others. People with epilepsy are more likely to have mental health conditions. They may be a result of dealing with the condition itself as well as medicine side effects. But even people with well-controlled epilepsy are at increased risk. Emotional health problems that may affect people with epilepsy include: Other life-threatening complications of epilepsy are not common but may happen. These include: ","Epilepsy — also known as a seizure disorder — is a brain condition that causes recurring seizures. There are many types of epilepsy. In some people, the cause can be identified. In others, the cause is not known. Epilepsy is common. It's estimated that 1.2% of people in the United States have active epilepsy, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Epilepsy affects people of all genders, races, ethnic backgrounds and ages. Seizure symptoms can vary widely. Some people may lose awareness during a seizure while others don't. Some people stare blankly for a few seconds during a seizure. Others may repeatedly twitch their arms or legs, movements known as convulsions. Having a single seizure doesn't mean you have epilepsy. Epilepsy is diagnosed if you've had at least two unprovoked seizures at least 24 hours apart. Unprovoked seizures don't have a clear cause. Treatment with medicines or sometimes surgery can control seizures for most people with epilepsy. Some people require lifelong treatment. For others, seizures go away. Some children with epilepsy may outgrow the condition with age. Seizure symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure.

Esophageal cancer,"Esophageal cancer may not cause symptoms early on. Symptoms of esophageal cancer usually happen when the disease is advanced. Signs and symptoms of esophageal cancer include: Make an appointment with your doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you. Esophageal cancer happens when cells lining the esophagus develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. Esophageal cancer is classified depending on the type of cells that are involved. The type of esophageal cancer you have helps determine your treatment options. Types of esophageal cancer include: Risk factors for esophageal cancer include conditions and habits that cause irritation in the esophagus. Risk factors may include: As esophageal cancer advances, it can cause complications. Complications may include: There's no sure way to prevent esophageal cancer, but you can reduce your risk if you: Screening for esophageal cancer may be an option for people with Barrett esophagus. Barrett esophagus is a precancerous condition caused by chronic acid reflux. It increases the risk of esophageal cancer. If you have Barrett esophagus, ask your healthcare professional about screening. Screening typically involves exams to look at the inside of the esophagus for signs of cancer. If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. Choose a healthy diet with a variety of fruits and vegetables. Food sources of vitamins and nutrients are best. Avoid taking large doses of vitamins in pill form, as they may be harmful. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week. If you haven't been active lately, ask your healthcare professional whether it's OK and start slowly. If your weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight. If you need to lose weight, ask a healthcare professional about healthy ways to lower your weight. Eat fewer calories and slowly increase the amount of exercise. Talk to your healthcare team about strategies and aids that can help you quit. Options include nicotine replacement products, medicines and support groups. If you've never smoked, don't start. ","Esophageal cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the esophagus.

Influenza (flu),"The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May. Symptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu. Other common flu symptoms include: In children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu. In some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes. Most people who get the flu can manage it at home and often don't need to see a healthcare professional. If you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your healthcare professional right away. Starting antiviral medicine within two days after your symptoms show up may shorten the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems. If you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away. For adults, emergency symptoms can include: Emergency symptoms in children include all the symptoms seen in adults, as well as: Influenza is caused by viruses. These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth. It's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time. Influenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often. A person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people. There are a range of factors that may raise your risk of catching a flu virus or having complications from a flu infection. Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes. People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu. An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine. Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease. In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza. Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus. Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters. People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications. If you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious. Although you may feel awful while you have it, the flu usually goes away in a week or two with no lasting effects. But people at high risk may develop other health problems after the flu, called complications. Getting another infection can be a complication of getting the flu. That includes illnesses such as croup and sinus or ear infections. Lung infections are another complication. Infection of the heart muscle or heart lining may happen after getting the flu. And in some cases, people may have infection of the central nervous system. Other complications may be: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu vaccination for people age 6 months and older who do not have a medical reason to avoid the vaccine. Getting a flu vaccine lowers: The 2024-2025 seasonal flu vaccines each provide protection against three influenza viruses that researchers expect to be the most common this flu season. The vaccine is available as a shot, a jet injector and a nasal spray. For older children and adults, the flu shot is usually given in a muscle in the arm. Younger children may get the flu shot in a thigh muscle. If you are an adult under the age of 65, you can choose to get your vaccine with a jet injector. Instead of a needle, this device uses a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to go through the skin. The nasal spray is approved for people between ages 2 and 49 years old. It isn't recommended for some groups, such as: Check with your healthcare team to see if you need to be cautious about getting a nasal spray flu vaccine. There also are vaccines offered called high-dose or adjuvanted flu vaccines. These vaccines may help some people avoid the need for care in the hospital due to influenza. People over age 65 can get these vaccines. These vaccines also are recommended for people age 18 and older who have a solid organ transplant and take medicine to weaken their immune response. If you have an egg allergy, you can still get a flu vaccine. The first time children between 6 months and 8 years get a flu vaccine, they may need two doses given at least four weeks apart. After that, they can receive single annual doses of the flu vaccine. Check with your child's healthcare professional. Also, check with your healthcare team before receiving a flu vaccine if you had a serious reaction to a previous flu vaccine. People who have had Guillain-Barre syndrome also should check with a healthcare professional before getting the flu vaccine. And if you feel sick when you go to get the shot, check with your healthcare team to see if you should delay getting the vaccine. The influenza vaccine isn't 100% effective. So it's important to take steps to lower the spread of infection, including: Also avoid anyone who is sick. If you're sick, stay home until you feel better and have had no fever for a full 24 hours, and you haven't taken medicine for fever during that time. If your fever returns or you start to feel worse, stay apart from others until your symptoms improve and you are fever-free without medicine for 24 hours. Doing so will lower your chance of infecting others. ","Flu, also called influenza, is an infection of the nose, throat and lungs, which are part of the respiratory system. The flu is caused by a virus. Influenza viruses are different from the ""stomach flu"" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting. Most people with the flu get better on their own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. To help protect against seasonal flu, you can get an annual flu shot. Although the vaccine isn't 100% effective, it lowers the chances of having severe complications from the flu. This is especially true for people who are at high risk of flu complications. Aside from the vaccine, you can take other steps to help prevent infection with the flu. You can clean and disinfect surfaces, wash hands, and keep the air around you moving. The viruses that cause flu spread at high levels during certain times of the year in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These are called flu seasons. In North America, flu season usually runs between October and May. Symptoms of the flu such as a sore throat and a runny or stuffy nose are common. You may also get these symptoms with other illness such as a cold. But colds tend to start slowly, and the flu tends to come on quickly, within two or three days after you come in contact with the virus. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu. Other common flu symptoms include: In children, these symptoms may show up more generally as being fussy or irritable. Children also are more likely than adults to have ear pain, feel sick to the stomach, vomit or have diarrhea with the flu. In some cases, people have eye pain, watery eyes or find that light hurts their eyes. Most people who get the flu can manage it at home and often don't need to see a healthcare professional. If you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your healthcare professional right away. Starting antiviral medicine within two days after your symptoms show up may shorten the length of your illness and help prevent more-serious problems. If you have emergency symptoms of the flu, get medical care right away. For adults, emergency symptoms can include: Emergency symptoms in children include all the symptoms seen in adults, as well as: Influenza is caused by viruses. These viruses travel through the air in droplets when someone with the infection coughs, sneezes or talks. You can inhale the droplets directly. Or you can pick up the virus from touching an object, such as a computer keyboard, and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth. It's possible to spread the virus to others from about a day before symptoms appear until about 5 to 7 days after they start. This is called being contagious. Children and people with weakened immune systems may be contagious for a slightly longer time. Influenza viruses are constantly changing, with new strains appearing often. A person's first flu infection gives some long-term protection against similar strains of flu. But the vaccines offered each year are made to match the flu virus strains that are most likely to spread that season. The protection these vaccines offer lasts for months in most people. There are a range of factors that may raise your risk of catching a flu virus or having complications from a flu infection. Seasonal influenza tends to have worse outcomes in young children, especially those age 2 years and younger. Adults older than age 65 also tend to have worse outcomes. People who live in facilities with many other residents, such as nursing homes, are more likely to get the flu. An immune system that doesn't quickly clear out flu virus may raise the risk of getting the flu or getting flu complications. People may have a weakened immune system response from birth, due to illness, or due to disease treatment or medicine. Chronic conditions may increase the risk of influenza complications. Examples include asthma and other lung diseases, diabetes, heart disease, nervous system diseases, previous history of stroke, metabolic disorders, problems with the airway, and kidney, liver or blood disease. In the United States, people who are Native American or Alaska Native, Black, or Latino may have a higher risk of needing care in the hospital for influenza. Young people on long-term aspirin therapy are at risk of developing Reye's syndrome if infected with the influenza virus. Pregnant people are more likely to develop influenza complications, particularly in the second and third trimesters. People with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher have an increased risk of flu complications. If you're young and healthy, the flu usually isn't serious.

Food poisoning,"Symptoms vary depending on what is causing the illness. They may begin within a few hours or a few weeks depending on the cause. Common symptoms are: Less often food poisoning affects the nervous system and can cause severe disease. Symptoms may include: Vomiting and diarrhea can quickly cause low levels of body fluids, also called dehydration, in infants and children. This can cause serious illness in infants. Call your child's health care provider if your child's symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea and any of the following: Adults should see a health care provider or get emergency care if the following occur: Many germs or harmful things, called contaminants, can cause foodborne illnesses. Food or drink that carries a contaminant is called ""contaminated."" Food can be contaminated with any of the following: The term ""food poisoning"" is commonly used to describe all foodborne illnesses. A health care provider might use these terms to be more specific: Food can be contaminated at any point from the farm or fishery to the table. The problem can begin during growing, harvesting or catching, processing, storing, shipping, or preparing. Food can be contaminated any place it's handled, including the home, because of: The following table shows common causes of foodborne illnesses, the time from exposure to the beginning of symptoms and common sources of contamination. Bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses can also be found in swimming pools, lakes, ponds, rivers and seawater. Also, some bacteria, such as E. coli, may be spread by exposure to animals carrying the disease. Anyone can get food poisoning. Some people are more likely to get sick or have more-serious disease or complications. These people include: In most healthy adults, complications are uncommon. They can include the following. The most common complication is dehydration. This a severe loss of water and salts and minerals. Both vomiting and diarrhea can cause dehydration. Most healthy adults can drink enough fluids to prevent dehydration. Children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems or other illnesses may not be able to replace the fluids they've lost. They are more likely to become dehydrated. People who become dehydrated may need to get fluids directly into the bloodstream at the hospital. Severe dehydration can cause organ damage, other severe disease and death if not treated. Some contaminants can cause more widespread disease in the body, also called systemic disease or infection. This is more common in people who are older, have weakened immune systems or other medical conditions. Systemic infections from foodborne bacteria may cause: Illness from the listeria bacteria during pregnancy can result in: Rare complications include conditions that may develop after food poisoning, including: To prevent food poisoning at home: Food poisoning is especially serious during pregnancies and for young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. These illnesses may be life-threatening. These individuals should avoid the following foods: ","Food poisoning, a type of foodborne illness, is a sickness people get from something they ate or drank. The causes are germs or other harmful things in the food or beverage. Symptoms of food poisoning often include upset stomach, diarrhea and vomiting.

Gangrene,"When gangrene affects the skin, signs and symptoms may include:
If gangrene affects tissues beneath the surface of your skin, such as gas gangrene or internal gangrene, you may also have a low-grade fever and generally feel unwell.
If the germs that caused the gangrene spread through the body, a condition called septic shock can occur. Signs and symptoms of septic shock include:
Gangrene is a serious condition and needs emergency treatment. Call your health care provider immediately if you have persistent, unexplained pain in any area of your body along with one or more of the following signs and symptoms:","Gangrene is death of body tissue due to a lack of blood flow or a serious bacterial infection. Gangrene commonly affects the arms and legs, including the toes and fingers. It can also occur in the muscles and in organs inside the body, such as the gallbladder.
A condition that can damage the blood vessels and affect blood flow, such as diabetes or hardened arteries (atherosclerosis), increases the risk of gangrene.
Treatments for gangrene may include antibiotics, oxygen therapy, and surgery to restore blood flow and remove dead tissue. The earlier gangrene is identified and treated, the better the chances for recovery."
Gingivitis,"Healthy gums are firm and pale pink. They fit tightly around the teeth. Symptoms of gingivitis include: If you notice any symptoms of gingivitis, schedule an appointment with your dentist as soon as possible. The sooner you seek care, the better your chances of reversing damage from gingivitis and not getting periodontitis. Your dentist may want you to see a periodontist if your symptoms aren't improving. This is a dentist with advanced training who specializes in treating gum diseases. The most common cause of gingivitis is poor care of teeth and gums, which allows plaque to form on teeth. This causes swelling of the surrounding gum tissues. Here's how plaque can lead to gingivitis: Gingivitis is common, and anyone can develop it. Factors that can increase your risk of gingivitis include: Untreated gingivitis can lead to gum disease that spreads to underlying tissue and bone, called periodontitis. This is a much more serious condition that can lead to tooth loss. Ongoing gum disease may be related to some diseases that affect the entire body, such as respiratory disease, diabetes, coronary artery disease, stroke and rheumatoid arthritis. Some research suggests that the bacteria responsible for periodontitis can enter your bloodstream through gum tissue, possibly affecting your heart, lungs and other parts of your body. But more studies are needed to confirm a link. Trench mouth, also known as necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis or NUG, is a severe form of gingivitis that causes painful, infected, bleeding gums and ulcers. Trench mouth is rare today in developed nations, though it's common in developing countries that have poor nutrition and poor living conditions. To prevent gingivitis: ","Gingivitis is a common and mild form of gum disease, also called periodontal disease. It causes irritation, redness, swelling and bleeding of your gingiva, which is the part of your gum around the base of your teeth. It's important to take gingivitis seriously and treat it promptly. Gingivitis does not cause bone loss. But left untreated, it can lead to a much more serious gum disease, called periodontitis, and tooth loss. The most common cause of gingivitis is not keeping your teeth and gums clean and healthy. Good oral health habits, such as brushing at least twice a day, flossing daily and getting regular dental checkups, can help prevent and reverse gingivitis. Healthy gums are firm and pale pink. They fit tightly around the teeth. Symptoms of gingivitis include: If you notice any symptoms of gingivitis, schedule an appointment with your dentist as soon as possible.

Glaucoma,"The symptoms of glaucoma depend on the type and stage of the condition. If you have symptoms that come on suddenly, you may have acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include bad headache and severe eye pain. You need treatment as soon as possible. Go to an emergency room or call an eye doctor, called an ophthalmologist, immediately. Glaucoma develops when the optic nerve becomes damaged. As this nerve gradually gets worse, blind spots develop in your vision. For reasons that eye doctors don't fully understand, this nerve damage is usually related to increased pressure in the eye. Raised eye pressure happens as the result of a buildup of fluid that flows throughout the inside of the eye. This fluid, called the aqueous humor, usually drains through a tissue located at the angle where the iris and cornea meet. This tissue is called the trabecular meshwork. The cornea is important to vision because it lets light into the eye. When the eye makes too much fluid or the drainage system doesn't work properly, eye pressure may increase. This is the most common form of glaucoma. The drainage angle formed by the iris and cornea remains open. But other parts of the drainage system don't drain properly. This may lead to a slow, gradual increase in eye pressure. This form of glaucoma happens when the iris bulges. The bulging iris partially or completely blocks the drainage angle. As a result, fluid can't circulate through the eye and pressure increases. Angle-closure glaucoma may happen suddenly or gradually. No one knows the exact reason why the optic nerve becomes damaged when eye pressure is healthy. The optic nerve may be sensitive or experience less blood flow. This limited blood flow may be caused by the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries or other conditions that damage circulation. The buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries also is known as atherosclerosis. A child may be born with glaucoma or develop it in the first few years of life. Blocked drainage, injury or an underlying medical condition may cause optic nerve damage. In pigmentary glaucoma, small pigment granules flake off from the iris and block or slow fluid drainage from the eye. Activities such as jogging sometimes stir up the pigment granules. That leads to a deposit of pigment granules on tissue located at the angle where the iris and cornea meet. The granule deposits cause an increase in pressure. Glaucoma tends to run in families. In some people, scientists have identified genes related to high eye pressure and optic nerve damage. Glaucoma can damage vision before you notice any symptoms. So be aware of these risk factors: Some people have narrow drainage angles, putting them at increased risk of angle-closure glaucoma. These steps may help find and manage glaucoma in its early stages. That may help to prevent vision loss or slow its progress.  Our patients tell us that the quality of their interactions, our attention to detail and the efficiency of their visits mean health care like they've never experienced. See the stories of satisfied Mayo Clinic patients.","Glaucoma is an eye condition that damages the optic nerve. This damage can lead to vision loss or blindness. The optic nerve sends visual information from your eye to the brain and is vital for good vision. Damage to the optic nerve is often related to high pressure in the eye. But glaucoma can happen even with typical eye pressure. Glaucoma can happen at any age but is more common in older adults. It is one of the leading causes of blindness for people over the age of 60. Many forms of glaucoma have no warning signs. The effect is so gradual that you may not notice a change in vision until the condition is in its later stages. It's important to have regular eye exams that include measurements of your eye pressure. If glaucoma is found early, vision loss can be slowed or prevented. If you have glaucoma, you'll need treatment or monitoring for the rest of your life. The symptoms of glaucoma depend on the type and stage of the condition.

Glioblastoma,"Signs and symptoms of glioblastoma may include: Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any signs or symptoms that worry you. The cause of most glioblastomas isn't known. Glioblastoma happens when cells in the brain or spinal cord develop changes in their DNA. Healthcare professionals sometimes call these changes mutations or variations. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. The cancer cells form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to press on nearby nerves and parts of the brain or spinal cord. This leads to glioblastoma symptoms and can cause complications. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. Factors that can increase the risk of glioblastoma include: Researchers haven't found anything you can do to prevent glioblastoma. ","Glioblastoma is a type of cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the brain or spinal cord. It grows quickly and can invade and destroy healthy tissue. Glioblastoma forms from cells called astrocytes that support nerve cells. Glioblastoma can happen at any age. But it tends to happen more often in older adults. Glioblastoma symptoms may include headaches that keep getting worse, nausea and vomiting, blurred or double vision, trouble speaking, altered sense of touch, and seizures. There also may be trouble with balance, coordination, and moving parts of the face or body. There's no cure for glioblastoma. Treatments might slow cancer growth and reduce symptoms.

Heat exhaustion,"Symptoms of heat exhaustion may start suddenly or progress over time, especially with prolonged periods of exercise. Possible heat exhaustion symptoms include: If you think you have heat exhaustion: Contact your doctor if your symptoms get worse or they don't improve within one hour. If you're with someone who has heat exhaustion, seek immediate medical help if they become confused or distressed, lose consciousness, or are unable to drink. If their core body temperature — measured by a rectal thermometer — reaches 104 F (40 C) or higher, they need immediate cooling and urgent medical attention. The body's heat combined with environmental heat results in what's called your core temperature. This is your body's inner temperature. Your body needs to regulate heat gain in hot weather or heat loss in cold weather to keep a core temperature that's typical for you. The average core temperature is about 98.6 F (37 C). In hot weather, your body cools itself mainly by sweating. The evaporation of your sweat regulates your body temperature. But when you exercise strenuously or otherwise overexert in hot, humid weather, your body is less able to cool itself efficiently. As a result, heat cramps may start in your body. Heat cramps are the mildest form of heat-related illness. Symptoms of heat cramps often include heavy sweating, fatigue, thirst and muscle cramps. Prompt treatment may prevent heat cramps from progressing to more-serious heat illnesses such as heat exhaustion. Drinking fluids or sports drinks that have electrolytes (Gatorade, Powerade, others) can help treat heat cramps. Other treatments for heat cramps include getting into cooler temperatures, such as an air-conditioned or shaded place, and resting. Besides hot weather and strenuous activity, other causes of heat exhaustion include: Anyone can get heat illness, but certain factors increase your sensitivity to heat. They include: If heat exhaustion isn't treated, it can lead to heatstroke. Heatstroke is a life-threatening condition. It happens when your core body temperature reaches 104 F (40 C) or higher. Heatstroke needs immediate medical attention to prevent permanent damage to your brain and other vital organs that can result in death. There are a lot of things you can do to prevent heat exhaustion and other heat-related illnesses. When temperatures climb, remember to: ","Heat exhaustion is a condition that happens when your body overheats. Symptoms may include heavy sweating and a rapid pulse. Heat exhaustion is one of three heat-related illnesses, with heat cramps being the mildest and heatstroke being the most serious.

Hemorrhoids,"Symptoms of hemorrhoids usually depend on the type of hemorrhoid. Internal hemorrhoids lie inside the rectum. You usually can't see or feel them, and they rarely cause discomfort. But straining or irritation when passing stool can cause: These are under the skin around the anus. Symptoms might include: Blood can pool in an external hemorrhoid and form a clot, called a thrombus. A thrombosed hemorrhoid can result in: If you have bleeding during bowel movements or you have hemorrhoids that don't improve after a week of home care, talk to your health care provider. Don't assume rectal bleeding is due to hemorrhoids, especially if you have changes in bowel habits or if your stools change in color or consistency. Rectal bleeding can happen with other diseases, including colorectal cancer and anal cancer. Seek emergency care if you have large amounts of rectal bleeding, lightheadedness, dizziness or faintness. The veins around the anus tend to stretch under pressure and may bulge or swell. Hemorrhoids can develop from increased pressure in the lower rectum due to: As people age, the risk of hemorrhoids increases. That's because the tissues that support the veins in the rectum and anus can weaken and stretch. This also can happen during pregnancy because the baby's weight puts pressure on the anal region. Complications of hemorrhoids are rare but may include: The best way to prevent hemorrhoids is to keep your stools soft so they pass easily. To prevent hemorrhoids and reduce symptoms of hemorrhoids, follow these tips: ","Hemorrhoids (HEM-uh-roids), also called piles, are swollen veins in the anus and lower rectum. Hemorrhoids are similar to varicose veins. Hemorrhoids can develop inside the rectum, called internal hemorrhoids. They also can develop under the skin around the anus, called external hemorrhoids.

Hepatitis B,"Symptoms of acute hepatitis B range from mild to serious. The symptoms usually start about 1 to 4 months after you've been infected withHBV. But you could notice them as early as two weeks after you're infected. Some people with acute or chronic hepatitis B may not have any symptoms, especially young children. Hepatitis B symptoms may include: If you know you've been exposed to the hepatitis B virus, call your healthcare professional right away. A preventive treatment may lower your risk of infection if you get the treatment within 24 hours of exposure to the virus. If you think you have symptoms of hepatitis B, call your healthcare professional. Hepatitis B is caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The virus passes from person to person through blood, semen or other body fluids. It does not spread by sneezing or coughing. Common ways thatHBVcan spread are: HBVinfection may be short-lived, also called acute. Or it might last a long time, also known as chronic. The younger you are when you get hepatitis B, the higher your risk of the condition becoming chronic. That's especially true for newborns or children younger than 5. Chronic hepatitis B may not be detected for decades until a person becomes very ill from liver disease. The hepatitis B virus spreads through contact with blood, semen or other body fluids from an infected person. Your risk ofHBVinfection rises if you: Having a chronicHBVinfection can lead to serious health conditions called complications. These include: The hepatitis B vaccine is the main way to prevent infection withHBV. The vaccine is given as two shots one month apart, or three or four shots over six months. How many shots you get depends on the type of hepatitis B vaccine that you're given. You can't get hepatitis B from the vaccine. In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that infants get their first shot of the vaccine after they're born. If you didn't get vaccinated as a baby or child, the committee still recommends the vaccine for everyone through age 59. If you're age 60 or older and haven't gotten vaccinated, get the vaccine if you're at risk of being exposed to the hepatitis B virus. People 60 and over who haven't been vaccinated and are not at high risk also can choose to get the vaccine. The hepatitis B vaccine is strongly recommended for: Other ways to lower your risk of infection with the hepatitis B virus include: ","Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). For most people, hepatitis B is short term, also called acute. Acute hepatitis B lasts less than six months. But for others, the infection lasts more than six months and is called chronic. Chronic hepatitis B raises the risk of liver failure, liver cancer and serious scarring of the liver called cirrhosis. Most adults with hepatitis B recover fully, even if their symptoms are bad. Infants and children are more likely to develop a chronic, long-lasting hepatitis B virus infection. A vaccine can prevent infection with the hepatitis B virus. For those who get infected, treatment depends on whether the infection is acute or chronic. Some people need medicine. Others with serious liver damage from a chronic infection need a liver transplant. If you're infected, taking certain safety measures can help prevent spreading the virus to others. Symptoms of acute hepatitis B range from mild to serious. The symptoms usually start about 1 to 4 months after you've been infected withHBV. But you could notice them as early as two weeks after you're infected. Some people with acute or chronic hepatitis B may not have any symptoms, especially young children.

High blood pressure (hypertension),"Most people with high blood pressure have no symptoms, even if blood pressure readings reach dangerously high levels. You can have high blood pressure for years without any symptoms.
A few people with high blood pressure may have:
However, these symptoms aren't specific. They usually don't occur until high blood pressure has reached a severe or life-threatening stage.
Blood pressure screening is an important part of general health care. How often you should get your blood pressure checked depends on your age and overall health.
Ask your provider for a blood pressure reading at least every two years starting at age 18. If you're age 40 or older, or you're 18 to 39 with a high risk of high blood pressure, ask for a blood pressure check every year.
Your care provider will likely recommend more-frequent readings if have high blood pressure or other risk factors for heart disease.
Children age 3 and older may have blood pressure measured as a part of their yearly checkups.
If you don't regularly see a care provider, you may be able to get a free blood pressure screening at a health resource fair or other locations in your community. Free blood pressure machines are also available in some stores and pharmacies. The accuracy of these machines depends on several things, such as a correct cuff size and proper use of the machines. Ask your health care provider for advice on using public blood pressure machines.","High blood pressure is a common condition that affects the body's arteries. It's also called hypertension. If you have high blood pressure, the force of the blood pushing against the artery walls is consistently too high. The heart has to work harder to pump blood.
Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). In general, hypertension is a blood pressure reading of 130/80 mm Hg or higher.
The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association divide blood pressure into four general categories. Ideal blood pressure is categorized as normal.)
Blood pressure higher than 180/120 mm Hg is considered a hypertensive emergency or crisis. Seek emergency medical help for anyone with these blood pressure numbers.
Untreated, high blood pressure increases the risk of heart attack, stroke and other serious health problems. It's important to have your blood pressure checked at least every two years starting at age 18. Some people need more-frequent checks.
Healthy lifestyle habits —such as not smoking, exercising and eating well — can help prevent and treat high blood pressure. Some people need medicine to treat high blood pressure.

Hip fracture,Signs and symptoms of a hip fracture include:,"A hip fracture is a serious injury, with complications that can be life-threatening. The risk of hip fracture rises with age.
Risk increases because bones tend to weaken with age (osteoporosis). Multiple medications, poor vision and balance problems also make older people more likely to fall — one of the most common causes of hip fracture.
A hip fracture almost always requires surgical repair or replacement, followed by physical therapy. Taking steps to maintain bone density and avoid falls can help prevent a hip fracture."
Horner syndrome,"Horner syndrome usually affects only one side of the face. Common signs and symptoms include:
Signs and symptoms, particularly ptosis and anhidrosis, may be subtle and difficult to detect.
Additional signs and symptoms in children with Horner syndrome may include:
A number of factors, some more serious than others, can cause Horner syndrome. It is important to get a prompt and accurate diagnosis.
Get emergency care if signs or symptoms associated with Horner syndrome appear suddenly, appear after a traumatic injury, or are accompanied by other signs or symptoms, such as:","Horner syndrome is a condition that affects the face and eye on one side of the body. It is caused by the disruption of a nerve pathway from the brain to the head and neck.
Decreased eye pupil size is a key sign of Horner syndrome.
Typically, signs and symptoms of Horner syndrome include decreased pupil size, a drooping eyelid and decreased sweating on the affected side of the face.
Horner syndrome may be the result of another medical problem, such as a stroke, tumor or spinal cord injury. In some cases, no underlying cause can be found. There's no specific treatment for Horner syndrome, but treatment for the underlying cause may restore nerve function.
Horner syndrome is also known as Bernard-Horner syndrome or oculosympathetic palsy."
Hydrocephalus,"The symptoms of hydrocephalus can vary by age. Common symptoms of hydrocephalus in infants include: Among toddlers and older children, symptoms might include: Common symptoms in this age group include: Among adults 60 and older, the more common symptoms of hydrocephalus are: Seek emergency medical care for infants and toddlerswith these symptoms: Seek prompt medical attentionfor other hydrocephalus symptoms in any age group. More than one condition can cause the problems associated with hydrocephalus. It's important to get a timely diagnosis and appropriate care. Hydrocephalus is caused by an imbalance between how much cerebrospinal fluid is produced and how much is absorbed into the bloodstream. Tissues lining the ventricles of the brain produce cerebrospinal fluid. It flows through the ventricles by way of channels. The fluid eventually flows into spaces around the brain and spinal column. It's absorbed primarily by blood vessels in tissues on the surface of the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid plays an important role in brain function by: Too much cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles can occur for one of the following reasons: Much of the time, the cause of hydrocephalus is not known. However, developmental or medical problems can contribute to or trigger hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus may be present at or before birth, known as congenital hydrocephalus. Or it can occur shortly after birth. Any of the following incidents may cause hydrocephalus in newborns: Other factors that can contribute to hydrocephalus among any age group include: In most cases, hydrocephalus worsens. Without treatment, hydrocephalus leads to complications. Complications may include learning disabilities or developmental and physical disabilities. Complications of this condition also can result in death. When hydrocephalus is mild and it's treated, there may be few, if any, serious complications. ","Hydrocephalus is the buildup of fluid in cavities called ventricles deep within the brain. The excess fluid increases the size of the ventricles and puts pressure on the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid usually flows through the ventricles and bathes the brain and spinal column. But the pressure of too much cerebrospinal fluid can damage brain tissues and cause a range of symptoms related to brain function. Hydrocephalus can happen at any age, but it occurs more often among infants and among adults 60 and older. Surgery can restore and maintain healthy cerebrospinal fluid levels in the brain. Therapies can manage symptoms resulting from hydrocephalus. The symptoms of hydrocephalus can vary by age. Common symptoms of hydrocephalus in infants include: Among toddlers and older children, symptoms might include: Common symptoms in this age group include: Among adults 60 and older, the more common symptoms of hydrocephalus are: Seek emergency medical care for infants and toddlerswith these symptoms: Seek prompt medical attentionfor other hydrocephalus symptoms in any age group.

Hydronephrosis,"Hydronephrosis often causes no symptoms. But when symptoms happen, they can include: Call your healthcare professional if you have any symptoms of hydronephrosis. Babies with the condition often don't have symptoms. But get your baby a healthcare checkup right away for symptoms such as high fever. Causes of hydronephrosis include a blockage or other health issue that affects the urinary tract. The urinary tract includes the kidneys and the bladder. Urine flows from the kidneys to the bladder through tubes called ureters. Urine leaves the bladder and the body through another tube called the urethra. A partly or fully blocked urinary tract can keep urine from leaving the kidneys and cause swelling. Other issues that disrupt the urinary tract can cause urine to flow backward through the ureters from the bladder up into the kidneys. When urine flows the wrong way, the condition is called vesicoureteral reflux. Causes of hydronephrosis include the following: Hydronephrosis risk factors among adults ages 20 to 60 include being born female. The higher risk could be due to certain conditions that affect the uterus, such as pregnancy. It also could be due to conditions that affect the ovaries, such as cysts, buildups of pus and cancer. Risk factors for people older than age 60 include having an enlarged prostate or a urinary tract blockage from cancer. Hydronephrosis can lead to other health conditions called complications. Without treatment, some people who have severe hydronephrosis develop lasting kidney damage. Rarely, the condition can cause an affected kidney to lose its ability to filter blood, also called kidney failure. ","Hydronephrosis is swelling of one or both kidneys. It happens when urine can't drain from a kidney and builds up in the kidney as a result. The condition can be due to a blockage in the tubes that drain urine from the kidneys. It also can happen due to a difference present at birth that prevents urine from draining properly. In some people, hydronephrosis causes kidney damage over time. Hydronephrosis can happen at any age. The condition often causes no symptoms. People who get symptoms may have side and back pain, painful urination, vomiting and fever. Healthcare professionals have various ways to spot hydronephrosis. Tests to find the condition can be done during infancy or sometimes before a baby is born. Treatment for hydronephrosis depends on the condition's cause. Some people need medicine or surgery to feel better and prevent kidney damage. Mild hydronephrosis sometimes goes away on its own over time. Hydronephrosis often causes no symptoms. But when symptoms happen, they can include: Call your healthcare professional if you have any symptoms of hydronephrosis. Babies with the condition often don't have symptoms.

Hypercalcemia,"You might not have any symptoms if your hypercalcemia is mild. If it's more serious, your symptoms are related to the parts of your body affected by high blood calcium levels. Examples include: Call your healthcare professional if you think you have any symptoms of hypercalcemia. These can include extreme thirst, frequent urination and pain in the stomach area. Calcium helps build strong bones and teeth. It also helps muscles contract and nerves send signals. When the parathyroid glands work right, they release hormones that help maintain the right balance of calcium in the blood. Parathyroid hormones trigger: This delicate balance between too little calcium in the blood and hypercalcemia can be affected by various factors. Hypercalcemia can be caused by: Hypercalcemia can lead to medical conditions that include: ","Hypercalcemia is a condition in which the calcium level in the blood becomes too high. Too much calcium in the blood can weaken bones and create kidney stones. It also can affect the heart and brain. Most often, hypercalcemia happens after one or more of the parathyroid glands make too much hormone. These four tiny glands are in the neck, near the thyroid gland. Other causes of hypercalcemia include cancer, certain other medical conditions and some medicines. Taking too much of calcium and vitamin D supplements also can cause hypercalcemia. Some people have no symptoms of this condition. Others have symptoms that range from mild to serious. Treatment depends on the cause. You might not have any symptoms if your hypercalcemia is mild. If it's more serious, your symptoms are related to the parts of your body affected by high blood calcium levels.

Hypoglycemia,"If blood sugar levels become too low, hypoglycemia signs and symptoms can include: As hypoglycemia worsens, signs and symptoms can include: Severe hypoglycemia may cause: Seek medical help immediately if: Seek emergency help for someone with diabetes or a history of hypoglycemia who has symptoms of severe hypoglycemia or loses consciousness. Hypoglycemia occurs when your blood sugar (glucose) level falls too low for bodily functions to continue. There are several reasons why this can happen. The most common reason for low blood sugar is a side effect of medications used to treat diabetes. When you eat, your body breaks down foods into glucose. Glucose, the main energy source for your body, enters the cells with the help of insulin — a hormone produced by your pancreas. Insulin allows the glucose to enter the cells and provide the fuel your cells need. Extra glucose is stored in your liver and muscles in the form of glycogen. When you haven't eaten for several hours and your blood sugar level drops, you will stop producing insulin. Another hormone from your pancreas called glucagon signals your liver to break down the stored glycogen and release glucose into your bloodstream. This keeps your blood sugar within a standard range until you eat again. Your body also has the ability to make glucose. This process occurs mainly in your liver, but also in your kidneys. With prolonged fasting, the body can break down fat stores and use products of fat breakdown as an alternative fuel. If you have diabetes, you might not make insulin (type 1 diabetes) or you might be less responsive to it (type 2 diabetes). As a result, glucose builds up in the bloodstream and can reach dangerously high levels. To correct this problem, you might take insulin or other medications to lower blood sugar levels. But too much insulin or other diabetes medications may cause your blood sugar level to drop too much, causing hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can also occur if you eat less than usual after taking your regular dose of diabetes medication, or if you exercise more than you typically do. Hypoglycemia in people without diabetes is much less common. Causes can include: Hypoglycemia usually occurs when you haven't eaten, but not always. Sometimes hypoglycemia symptoms occur after certain meals, but exactly why this happens is uncertain. This type of hypoglycemia, called reactive hypoglycemia or postprandial hypoglycemia, can occur in people who have had surgeries that interfere with the usual function of the stomach. The surgery most commonly associated with this is stomach bypass surgery, but it can also occur in people who have had other surgeries. Untreated hypoglycemia can lead to: Hypoglycemia can also cause: Over time, repeated episodes of hypoglycemia can lead to hypoglycemia unawareness. The body and brain no longer produce signs and symptoms that warn of a low blood sugar, such as shakiness or irregular heartbeats (palpitations). When this happens, the risk of severe, life-threatening hypoglycemia increases. If you have diabetes, recurring episodes of hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia unawareness, your health care provider might modify your treatment, raise your blood sugar level goals and recommend blood glucose awareness training. A continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is an option for some people with hypoglycemia unawareness. The device can alert you when your blood sugar is too low. If you have diabetes, episodes of low blood sugar are uncomfortable and can be frightening. Fear of hypoglycemia can cause you to take less insulin to ensure that your blood sugar level doesn't go too low. This can lead to uncontrolled diabetes. Talk to your health care provider about your fear, and don't change your diabetes medication dose without discussing changes with your health care provider. Follow the diabetes management plan you and your health care provider have developed. If you're taking new medications, changing your eating or medication schedules, or adding new exercise, talk to your health care provider about how these changes might affect your diabetes management and your risk of low blood sugar. Learn the signs and symptoms you experience with low blood sugar. This can help you identify and treat hypoglycemia before it gets too low. Frequently checking your blood sugar level lets you know when your blood sugar is getting low. A continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is a good option for some people. ACGMhas a tiny wire that's inserted under the skin that can send blood glucose readings to a receiver. If blood sugar levels are dropping too low, someCGMmodels will alert you with an alarm. Some insulin pumps are now integrated withCGMsand can shut off insulin delivery when blood sugar levels are dropping too quickly to help prevent hypoglycemia. Be sure to always have a fast-acting carbohydrate with you, such as juice, hard candy or glucose tablets so that you can treat a falling blood sugar level before it dips dangerously low. For recurring episodes of hypoglycemia, eating frequent small meals throughout the day is a stopgap measure to help prevent blood sugar levels from getting too low. However, this approach isn't advised as a long-term strategy. Work with your health care provider to identify and treat the cause of hypoglycemia. ","Hypoglycemia is a condition in which your blood sugar (glucose) level is lower than the standard range. Glucose is your body's main energy source. Hypoglycemia is often related to diabetes treatment. But other drugs and a variety of conditions — many rare — can cause low blood sugar in people who don't have diabetes. Hypoglycemia needs immediate treatment. For many people, a fasting blood sugar of 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 3.9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L), or below should serve as an alert for hypoglycemia. But your numbers might be different. Ask your health care provider. Treatment involves quickly getting your blood sugar back to within the standard range either with a high-sugar food or drink or with medication. Long-term treatment requires identifying and treating the cause of hypoglycemia. If blood sugar levels become too low, hypoglycemia signs and symptoms can include: As hypoglycemia worsens, signs and symptoms can include: Severe hypoglycemia may cause: Seek medical help immediately if: Seek emergency help for someone with diabetes or a history of hypoglycemia who has symptoms of severe hypoglycemia or loses consciousness.

Hyponatremia,"Hyponatremia signs and symptoms may include: Seek emergency care for anyone who develops severe signs and symptoms of hyponatremia, such as nausea and vomiting, confusion, seizures, or lost consciousness. Call your doctor if you know you are at risk of hyponatremia and are experiencing nausea, headaches, cramping or weakness. Depending on the extent and duration of these signs and symptoms, your doctor may recommend seeking immediate medical care. Sodium plays a key role in your body. It helps maintain normal blood pressure, supports the work of your nerves and muscles, and regulates your body's fluid balance. A normal blood sodium level is between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). Hyponatremia occurs when the sodium in your blood falls below 135 mEq/L. Many possible conditions and lifestyle factors can lead to hyponatremia, including: The following factors may increase your risk of hyponatremia: In chronic hyponatremia, sodium levels drop gradually over 48 hours or longer — and symptoms and complications are typically more moderate. In acute hyponatremia, sodium levels drop rapidly — resulting in potentially dangerous effects, such as rapid brain swelling, which can result in a coma and death. Premenopausal women appear to be at the greatest risk of hyponatremia-related brain damage. This may be related to the effect of women's sex hormones on the body's ability to balance sodium levels. The following measures may help you prevent hyponatremia: ","Hyponatremia occurs when the concentration of sodium in your blood is abnormally low. Sodium is an electrolyte, and it helps regulate the amount of water that's in and around your cells. In hyponatremia, one or more factors — ranging from an underlying medical condition to drinking too much water — cause the sodium in your body to become diluted. When this happens, your body's water levels rise, and your cells begin to swell. This swelling can cause many health problems, from mild to life-threatening. Hyponatremia treatment is aimed at resolving the underlying condition. Depending on the cause of hyponatremia, you may simply need to cut back on how much you drink. In other cases of hyponatremia, you may need intravenous electrolyte solutions and medications. Hyponatremia signs and symptoms may include: Seek emergency care for anyone who develops severe signs and symptoms of hyponatremia, such as nausea and vomiting, confusion, seizures, or lost consciousness. Call your doctor if you know you are at risk of hyponatremia and are experiencing nausea, headaches, cramping or weakness.

Inflammatory breast cancer,"Inflammatory breast cancer doesn't commonly form a lump, as occurs with other forms of breast cancer. Instead, signs and symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer include: For inflammatory breast cancer to be diagnosed, these symptoms must have been present for less than six months. Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you. Other, more common conditions have symptoms similar to those of inflammatory breast cancer. A breast injury or breast infection, called mastitis, may cause skin color changes, swelling and pain. Inflammatory breast cancer can easily be confused with a breast infection, which is much more common. It's reasonable and common to first be treated with antibiotics for a week or more. If your symptoms respond to antibiotics, additional testing isn't necessary. But if the condition does not improve, your healthcare professional may consider more-serious causes of your symptoms, such as inflammatory breast cancer. If you've been treated for a breast infection but your symptoms continue, contact your healthcare professional. You may have a mammogram or other test to evaluate your symptoms. The only way a healthcare professional can know whether your symptoms are caused by inflammatory breast cancer is to remove a sample of tissue for testing. Inflammatory breast cancer happens when cells in the breast develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. Most often the DNA changes happen in a cell in one of the tubes, called ducts, that can carry breast milk to the nipple. But the cancer also can begin with a cell in the glandular tissue, called lobules, where breast milk can be produced. In inflammatory breast cancer, the cancer cells break away from where they started. They travel to the lymphatic vessels in the breast skin. The cells grow to clog the vessels. The blockage in the lymphatic vessels causes skin color changes, swelling and dimpled skin. This skin is a classic sign of inflammatory breast cancer. Factors that increase the risk of inflammatory breast cancer include: Women are much more likely than men to get breast cancer, including inflammatory breast cancer. Everyone is born with some breast tissue, so anyone can get breast cancer. Inflammatory breast cancer is more frequently diagnosed in people in their 40s and 50s. Black people have a higher risk of inflammatory breast cancer than do white people. People who are obese have a greater risk of inflammatory breast cancer. Making changes in your daily life may help lower your risk of breast cancer. Try to: Talk with your doctor or other healthcare professional about when to begin breast cancer screening. Ask about the benefits and risks of screening. Together, you can decide what breast cancer screening tests are right for you. You may choose to become familiar with your breasts by occasionally inspecting them during a breast self-exam for breast awareness. If you find a new change, lumps or other unusual signs in your breasts, tell a healthcare professional right away. Breast awareness can't prevent breast cancer. But it may help you to better understand the look and feel of your breasts. This might make it more likely that you'll notice if something changes. If you choose to drink, limit the amount of alcohol you drink to no more than one drink a day. For breast cancer prevention, there is no safe amount of alcohol. So if you're very concerned about your breast cancer risk, you may choose to not drink alcohol. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week. If you haven't been active lately, ask your healthcare professional whether exercising is OK and start slowly. Combination hormone therapy may increase the risk of breast cancer. Talk with a healthcare professional about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy. Some people have symptoms during menopause that cause discomfort. These people may decide that the risks of hormone therapy are acceptable to get relief. To reduce the risk of breast cancer, use the lowest dose of hormone therapy possible for the shortest amount of time. If your weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight. If you need to lose weight, ask a healthcare professional about healthy ways to lower your weight. Eat fewer calories and slowly increase the amount you exercise. ","Inflammatory breast cancer is a form of breast cancer that causes breast swelling and skin changes. Inflammatory breast cancer happens when a growth of cells forms in the breast tissue. The cells break away from where they started to grow and travel to the lymphatic vessels in the skin. The cells can block the vessels and cause the skin on the breast to look swollen. This skin on the breast might look red or purple. Inflammatory breast cancer is considered a locally advanced cancer. When a cancer is locally advanced, that means it has spread from where it started to nearby tissue and possibly to nearby lymph nodes. Inflammatory breast cancer can easily be confused with a breast infection, which is a much more common cause of breast swelling and skin changes. Seek medical attention right away if you notice skin changes on your breast. Inflammatory breast cancer doesn't commonly form a lump, as occurs with other forms of breast cancer.

Inguinal hernia,"Inguinal hernia signs and symptoms include:
Inguinal hernias in newborns and children result from a weakness in the abdominal wall that's present at birth. Sometimes the hernia will be visible only when an infant is crying, coughing or straining during a bowel movement. He or she might be irritable and have less appetite than usual.
In an older child, a hernia is likely to be more apparent when the child coughs, strains during a bowel movement or stands for a long period.
If you aren't able to push the hernia in, the contents of the hernia may be trapped (incarcerated) in the abdominal wall. An incarcerated hernia can become strangulated, which cuts off the blood flow to the tissue that's trapped. A strangulated hernia can be life-threatening if it isn't treated.
Signs and symptoms of a strangulated hernia include:
Seek immediate care if a hernia bulge turns red, purple or dark or if you notice any other signs or symptoms of a strangulated hernia.
See your doctor if you have a painful or noticeable bulge in your groin on either side of your pubic bone. The bulge is likely to be more noticeable when you're standing, and you usually can feel it if you put your hand directly over the affected area.","An inguinal hernia occurs when tissue, such as part of the intestine, protrudes through a weak spot in the abdominal muscles. The resulting bulge can be painful, especially when you cough, bend over or lift a heavy object. However, many hernias do not cause pain.
Inguinal hernias occur when part of the membrane lining the abdominal cavity (omentum) or intestine protrudes through a weak spot in the abdomen — often along the inguinal canal, which carries the spermatic cord in men.
An inguinal hernia isn't necessarily dangerous. It doesn't improve on its own, however, and can lead to life-threatening complications. Your doctor is likely to recommend surgery to fix an inguinal hernia that's painful or enlarging. Inguinal hernia repair is a common surgical procedure."
Kawasaki disease,"Symptoms of Kawasaki disease include a fever greater than 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius) for five or more days. And the child  has at least four of the following symptoms. The symptoms might not happen at the same time. Let your child's healthcare professional know about a symptom that has gone away. Other symptoms might include: Some children get a high fever for five or more days but have fewer than four of the symptoms needed for a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease. They might have what's called incomplete Kawasaki disease. Children with incomplete Kawasaki disease are still at risk of damage to the heart arteries. They still need treatment within 10 days of when symptoms appear. Kawasaki disease can have symptoms like those of a condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. The syndrome happens in children with COVID-19. If your child has a fever that lasts more than three days, contact your child's healthcare professional. Treating Kawasaki disease within 10 days of when it began may reduce the chances of lasting damage to the arteries that supply the heart. No one knows what causes Kawasaki disease. But experts don't believe the disease spreads from person to person. Some think that Kawasaki disease happens after a bacterial or viral infection, or that it's linked to factors in the environment. Certain genes might make children more likely to get Kawasaki disease. Three things are known to increase a child's risk of developing Kawasaki disease. Kawasaki disease tends to occur seasonally. In North America and countries with like climates, it most often happens in the winter and early spring. Kawasaki disease is a leading cause of heart disease in children who live in developed countries. But, with treatment, few children have lasting damage. Heart complications include: Any of these complications can damage the heart. Swelling of the heart arteries can weaken them and cause a bulge in the artery wall, called an aneurysm. Aneurysms raise the risk of blood clots. These can lead to a heart attack or cause bleeding inside the body. Rarely, for children who get heart artery problems, Kawasaki disease can cause death. ","Kawasaki disease causes swelling, called inflammation, in the walls of small to medium-sized blood vessels that carry blood throughout the body. Kawasaki disease most often affects the heart arteries in children. Those arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart. Kawasaki disease  is sometimes called mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. That's because it also causes swelling in glands, called lymph nodes, and mucous membranes inside the mouth, nose, eyes and throat. Children with Kawasaki disease might have high fever, swollen hands and feet with skin peeling, and red eyes and tongue. But Kawasaki disease is often treatable. With early treatment, most children get better and have no long-lasting problems. Symptoms of Kawasaki disease include a fever greater than 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius) for five or more days. And the child  has at least four of the following symptoms.

Kidney cancer,"Kidney cancer doesn't usually cause symptoms at first. In time, signs and symptoms may develop, including: Make an appointment with a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any symptoms that worry you. It's not clear what causes most kidney cancers. Kidney cancer happens when cells in the kidney develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. The cancer cells form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. Factors that may increase the risk of kidney cancer include: There's no sure way to prevent kidney cancer, but you may reduce your risk if you: If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. Choose a healthy diet with a variety of fruits and vegetables. Food sources of vitamins and nutrients are best. Avoid taking large doses of vitamins in pill form, as they may be harmful. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week. If you haven't been active lately, ask your healthcare professional whether it's OK and start slowly. If your weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight. If you need to lose weight, ask a healthcare professional about healthy ways to lower your weight. Eat fewer calories and slowly increase the amount of exercise. Talk with your healthcare team about strategies and aids that can help you quit. Options include nicotine replacement products, medicines and support groups. If you've never smoked, don't start. Ask your healthcare professional to check your blood pressure at your next appointment. If your blood pressure is high, you can discuss options for lowering your numbers. Lifestyle measures such as exercise, weight loss and diet changes can help. Some people may need to add medicines to lower their blood pressure. Discuss your options with your healthcare team. ","Kidney cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the kidneys. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist. They're located behind the abdominal organs, with one kidney on each side of the spine. In adults, renal cell carcinoma is the most common type of kidney cancer. Other, less common types of kidney cancer can happen. Young children are more likely to develop a kind of kidney cancer called Wilms tumor. The number of kidney cancers diagnosed each year seems to be increasing. One reason for this may be the fact that imaging techniques such as CT scans are being used more often. These tests may lead to the incidental discovery of more kidney cancers. Kidney cancer is often found when the cancer is small and confined to the kidney.

Lead poisoning,"Initially, lead poisoning can be hard to detect — even people who seem healthy can have high blood levels of lead. Signs and symptoms usually don't appear until dangerous amounts have accumulated.
Signs and symptoms of lead poisoning in children include:
Babies exposed to lead before birth might:
Although children are primarily at risk, lead poisoning is also dangerous for adults. Signs and symptoms in adults might include:","Lead poisoning occurs when lead builds up in the body, often over months or years. Even small amounts of lead can cause serious health problems. Children younger than 6 years are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning, which can severely affect mental and physical development. At very high levels, lead poisoning can be fatal.
Lead-based paint and lead-contaminated dust in older buildings are common sources of lead poisoning in children. Other sources include contaminated air, water and soil. Adults who work with batteries, do home renovations or work in auto repair shops also might be exposed to lead.
There is treatment for lead poisoning, but taking some simple precautions can help protect you and your family from lead exposure before harm is done."
Leukoplakia,"Leukoplakia usually occurs on the gums, the insides of the cheeks, the bottom of the mouth under the tongue and, sometimes, the tongue. Usually it is not painful and it may not be noticed for a while. Leukoplakia may appear as: White patches of leukoplakia may appear along with raised, red areas called erythroplakia (uh-rith-roe-PLAY-key-uh). This combination is called speckled leukoplakia. These patches are more likely to show changes that may lead to cancer. Hairy leukoplakia causes fuzzy, white patches that look like folds or ridges. The patches usually form on the sides of the tongue. Hairy leukoplakia is often mistaken as oral thrush, an infection that causes creamy white patches that can be wiped away. Oral thrush also is common in people with weak immune systems. Even though leukoplakia does not usually cause discomfort, sometimes it can suggest a more serious condition. See your doctor or other healthcare professional if you have any of these: The exact cause of leukoplakia is not known. But long-term irritation from tobacco use — smoked and smokeless — appears to be strongly related to many cases. Often, regular users of smokeless tobacco products get leukoplakia in places where they hold the tobacco between their gums and cheeks. The use of betel nut, also called an areca nut, may be a cause of leukoplakia. A betel nut packet, like smokeless tobacco, is held between the gum and cheek. Other possible causes may include ongoing irritation from: Your doctor or other healthcare professional can talk with you about what may be causing leukoplakia. Hairy leukoplakia results from infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Once you've been infected withEBV, the virus remains in your body for life. Usually the virus is not active and does not cause symptoms. But if your immune system is weakened, especially from HIV/AIDS, the virus can become active. This can lead to conditions such as hairy leukoplakia. Tobacco use, particularly smokeless tobacco, puts you at high risk of leukoplakia and mouth cancer. Long-term, heavy alcohol use increases your risk. Drinking alcohol combined with using tobacco increases your risk even more. People with HIV/AIDS are especially likely to develop hairy leukoplakia. The use of medicines that slow down or prevent HIV activity has reduced the number of people who get hairy leukoplakia. But it still affects many people who are HIV positive. It may be one of the early signs of HIV infection. Leukoplakia usually does not cause permanent damage to the inside of the mouth. But leukoplakia increases the risk of mouth cancer. Mouth cancers often form near leukoplakia patches. And the patches themselves may show cancerous changes. Even after leukoplakia patches are removed, the risk of mouth cancer remains. Hairy leukoplakia is not likely to lead to cancer. But it may be an early symptom of HIV/AIDS. You may be able to prevent leukoplakia if you avoid all tobacco products or alcohol use. Talk to your doctor or other healthcare professional about ways to help you quit. If you continue to smoke or chew tobacco or drink alcohol, have dental checkups often. Mouth cancers are usually painless until advanced. Quitting tobacco and alcohol is a better way to prevent mouth cancers. If you have a weak immune system, you may not be able to prevent hairy leukoplakia. But finding it early can help you get proper treatment. ","Leukoplakia (loo-koh-PLAY-key-uh) causes thick, white patches that form on the gums. The patches also may form on the insides of the cheeks and the bottom of the mouth. Sometimes the patches form on the tongue. These patches cannot be scraped off. Doctors do not know the exact cause of leukoplakia. But ongoing irritation from tobacco — whether smoked, dipped or chewed — may be the most common cause. Long-term alcohol use is another possible cause. Most leukoplakia patches are not cancer. But some patches show early signs of cancer. Cancers in the mouth can occur next to areas of leukoplakia. White areas mixed with red areas, also called speckled leukoplakia, may possibly lead to cancer. It's best to see your dentist or doctor if you have any changes in your mouth that do not go away.

Lichen planus,"Symptoms of lichen planus vary depending on the part of the body affected. Nail disease usually affects several nails. Symptoms include: See your health care provider if tiny bumps or a rash appears on your skin for no known reason, such as contact with poison ivy. Also see your health care provider if you have any symptoms related to lichen planus of the mouth, genitals, scalp or nails. It's best to get a prompt and correct diagnosis because a number of skin and mucous membrane conditions can cause sores and pain. The cause of lichen planus is likely related to the immune system attacking cells of the skin or mucous membranes. It's not clear why this irregular immune response happens. The condition isn't contagious. Lichen planus may be activated by: Anyone can develop lichen planus. It most often affects middle-aged adults. Lichen planus in the mouth is more likely to affect women than men. Lichen planus can be difficult to treat on the vulva and in the vagina. It can cause scarring and severe pain. Sores on the genitals can make sex painful. The affected skin and nails might stay slightly darker even after healing. Oral sores may affect your ability to eat. Oral lichen planus increases the risk of oral cancer. Rarely, lichen planus affects the ear canal. Left untreated, it may lead to hearing loss. ","Lichen planus (LIE-kun PLAY-nus) is a condition of the skin, hair, nails, mouth and genitals. On skin, lichen planus often appears as purple, itchy, flat bumps that develop over several weeks. In the mouth and genital mucosa, lichen planus forms lacy white patches, sometimes with painful sores. Mild lichen planus of the skin may not need treatment. If the condition causes pain or intense itching, you may need prescription medicine. Symptoms of lichen planus vary depending on the part of the body affected. Nail disease usually affects several nails. Symptoms include: See your health care provider if tiny bumps or a rash appears on your skin for no known reason, such as contact with poison ivy.

The condition isn't contagious. Lichen planus may be activated by: Anyone can develop lichen planus. It most often affects middle-aged adults. Lichen planus in the mouth is more likely to affect women than men. Lichen planus can be difficult to treat on the vulva and in the vagina. It can cause scarring and severe pain. Sores on the genitals can make sex painful. The affected skin and nails might stay slightly darker even after healing. Oral sores may affect your ability to eat. Oral lichen planus increases the risk of oral cancer. Rarely, lichen planus affects the ear canal. Left untreated, it may lead to hearing loss. "
Lipoma,"Lipomas can occur anywhere in the body. They are typically:
A lipoma is rarely a serious medical condition. But if you notice a lump or swelling anywhere on your body, have it checked by your doctor.","A lipoma is a slow-growing, fatty lump that's most often situated between your skin and the underlying muscle layer. A lipoma, which feels doughy and usually isn't tender, moves readily with slight finger pressure. Lipomas are usually detected in middle age. Some people have more than one lipoma.
A lipoma isn't cancer and usually is harmless. Treatment generally isn't necessary, but if the lipoma bothers you, is painful or is growing, you may want to have it removed.
A lipoma is a fatty tumor located just below the skin. It isn't cancer and is usually harmless."
Listeria infection,"If you develop a listeria infection, you might have:
Symptoms might begin a few days after you've eaten contaminated food, but it can take 30 days or more before the first signs and symptoms of infection begin.
If the listeria infection spreads to your nervous system, signs and symptoms can include:
During pregnancy, a listeria infection is likely to cause only mild signs and symptoms in the mother. The consequences for the baby, however, can be devastating — the baby can die in the womb or have a life-threatening infection within a few days of being born.
Signs and symptoms of a listeria infection in a newborn can be subtle, but can include:
If you've eaten a food that's been recalled because of a listeria outbreak, watch for signs or symptoms of illness. If you have a fever, muscle aches, nausea or diarrhea, contact your doctor. The same goes for illness after eating a potentially contaminated product, such as foods made with unpasteurized milk or poorly heated hot dogs or deli meats.
If you have a high fever, severe headache, stiff neck, confusion or sensitivity to light, seek emergency care. These signs and symptoms can indicate bacterial meningitis, a life-threatening complication of a listeria infection.","Listeria infection is a foodborne bacterial illness that can be very serious for pregnant women, people older than 65 and people with weakened immune systems. It's most commonly caused by eating improperly processed deli meats and unpasteurized milk products.
Healthy people rarely become ill from listeria infection, but the disease can be fatal to unborn babies, newborns and people with weakened immune systems. Prompt antibiotic treatment can help curb the effects of listeria infection.
Listeria bacteria can survive refrigeration and even freezing. So people who are at higher risk of serious infections should avoid eating the types of food most likely to contain listeria bacteria."
Liver cancer,"Most people don't have signs and symptoms in the early stages of primary liver cancer. When signs and symptoms do appear, they may include: Make an appointment with your doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms that worry you. Liver cancer happens when liver cells develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. A cell's DNA is the material that provides instructions for every chemical process in your body. DNA mutations cause changes in these instructions. One result is that cells may begin to grow out of control and eventually form a tumor — a mass of cancerous cells. Sometimes the cause of liver cancer is known, such as with chronic hepatitis infections. But sometimes liver cancer happens in people with no underlying diseases and it's not clear what causes it. Factors that increase the risk of primary liver cancer include: Cirrhosis is scarring of the liver, and it increases the risk of liver cancer. You can reduce your risk of cirrhosis if you: You can reduce your risk of hepatitis B by receiving the hepatitis B vaccine. The vaccine can be given to almost anyone, including infants, older adults and those with compromised immune systems. No vaccine for hepatitis C exists, but you can reduce your risk of infection. Treatments are available for hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections. Research shows that treatment can reduce the risk of liver cancer. For the general population, screening for liver cancer hasn't been proved to reduce the risk of dying of liver cancer, and it isn't generally recommended. People with conditions that increase the risk of liver cancer might consider screening, such as people who have: Discuss the pros and cons of screening with your doctor. Together you can decide whether screening is right for you based on your risk. Screening typically involves a blood test and an abdominal ultrasound exam every six months. ","Liver cancer is cancer that begins in the cells of your liver. Your liver is a football-sized organ that sits in the upper right portion of your abdomen, beneath your diaphragm and above your stomach. Several types of cancer can form in the liver. The most common type of liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma, which begins in the main type of liver cell (hepatocyte). Other types of liver cancer, such as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and hepatoblastoma, are much less common. Cancer that spreads to the liver is more common than cancer that begins in the liver cells. Cancer that begins in another area of the body — such as the colon, lung or breast — and then spreads to the liver is called metastatic cancer rather than liver cancer. This type of cancer is named after the organ in which it began — such as metastatic colon cancer to describe cancer that begins in the colon and spreads to the liver. Most people don't have signs and symptoms in the early stages of primary liver cancer.

Mammary duct ectasia,"Mammary duct ectasia often doesn't cause any signs or symptoms, but some people experience:
A bacterial infection called mastitis also may develop in the affected milk duct, causing breast tenderness, inflammation in the area around the nipple (areola) and fever.
Signs and symptoms of mammary duct ectasia may improve on their own.
A nipple that's always been turned inward (inverted) usually isn't a medical concern. But a nipple that has recently turned inward should be checked by a doctor.
Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice changes in your breasts — such as a new breast lump, spontaneous nipple discharge, skin redness or inflammation, or an inverted nipple — that are persistent or that worry you.","Mammary duct ectasia (ek-TAY-zhuh) occurs when one or more milk ducts beneath your nipple widens. The duct walls may thicken, and the duct may fill with fluid. The milk duct may become blocked or clogged with a thick, sticky substance. The condition often causes no symptoms, but some women may have nipple discharge, breast tenderness or inflammation of the clogged duct (periductal mastitis).
Mammary duct ectasia most often occurs in women during perimenopause — around age 45 to 55 years — but it can happen after menopause, too. The condition often improves without treatment. If symptoms persist, you may need antibiotics or possibly surgery to remove the affected milk duct.
Though it's normal to worry about any changes in your breasts, mammary duct ectasia and periductal mastitis aren't risk factors for breast cancer.
Mammary duct ectasia occurs when one or more milk ducts beneath the nipple becomes wider (dilated). The duct may also fill with fluid and become blocked or clogged with a thick, sticky substance. Mammary duct ectasia usually causes no signs or symptoms, but some women may have nipple discharge, breast tenderness or inflammation of the clogged duct."
Measles,"Measles signs and symptoms appear around 10 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Signs and symptoms of measles typically include:
The infection occurs in stages over 2 to 3 weeks.
Acute illness and rash.The rash is made up of small red spots, some of which are slightly raised. Spots and bumps in tight clusters give the skin a splotchy red appearance. The face breaks out first.
Over the next few days, the rash spreads down the arms, chest and back, then over the thighs, lower legs and feet. At the same time, the fever rises sharply, often as high as 104 to 105.8 F (40 to 41 C).
A person with measles can spread the virus to others for about eight days, starting four days before the rash appears and ending when the rash has been present for four days.
Call your health care provider if you think you or your child may have been exposed to measles or if you or your child has a rash that looks like measles.
Review your family's vaccination records with your provider, especially before your children start day care, school or college and before international travel outside of the U.S.","Measles is a childhood infection caused by a virus. Once quite common, measles can now almost always be prevented with a vaccine.
Also called rubeola, measles spreads easily and can be serious and even fatal for small children. While death rates have been falling worldwide as more children receive the measles vaccine, the disease still kills more than 200,000 people a year, mostly children.
As a result of high vaccination rates in general, measles hasn't been widespread in the United States in about two decades. Most recent measles cases in the U.S. originated outside the country and occurred in people who were unvaccinated or who didn't know whether or not they had been vaccinated.
Measles causes a red, blotchy rash that usually appears first on the face and behind the ears, then spreads downward to the chest and back and finally to the feet."
Melanoma,"The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are: Melanoma doesn't always begin as a mole. It also can happen on otherwise healthy skin. Melanomas symptoms can happen anywhere on the body. Melanomas most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun. This includes the arms, back, face and legs. Melanomas also can happen in areas that aren't as exposed to the sun. This includes the soles of the feet, palms of the hands and fingernail beds. Melanoma also can happen inside the body. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with brown or Black skin. Typical moles are generally a uniform color. They might look pink, tan, brown or black. In people with brown and Black skin, typical moles are more likely to be dark brown or black. Typical moles have a distinct border separating the mole from the surrounding skin. They're oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter. Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even go away with age. Some moles aren't typical. They may have certain characteristics that indicate melanomas or other skin cancers. Characteristics may include: Moles that become cancers can all look very different. Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics. Melanomas also can develop in areas of the body that have little or no exposure to the sun. These areas may include the spaces between the toes and on the palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn't think to check. When melanoma occurs in people with brown or Black skin, it's more likely to occur in a hidden area. Hidden melanomas include: Make an appointment with your doctor or other healthcare professional if you notice any skin changes that worry you. Melanoma happens when something changes healthy melanocytes into cancer cells. Melanocytes are skin cells that make pigment that gives skin its color. The pigment is called melanin. Melanoma starts when melanocytes develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. In healthy cells, DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. It isn't clear what changes the DNA in skin cells and how it leads to melanoma. It's likely a combination of factors, including environmental and genetic factors. Still, healthcare professionals believe exposure to ultraviolet light is the leading cause of melanoma. Ultraviolet light, also called UV light, comes from the sun and from tanning lamps and beds. UVlight doesn't cause all melanomas, especially those that occur in places on your body that don't receive exposure to sunlight. This means that other factors may contribute to your risk of melanoma. Factors that may increase the risk of melanoma include: You can reduce your risk of melanoma and other types of skin cancer if you: ","Melanoma is a kind of skin cancer that starts in the melanocytes.

"Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1)","Symptoms of multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) can include the following: Symptoms are caused by the release of too many hormones in the body. Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) is caused by a change in the MEN1 gene. That gene controls how the body makes a protein called menin. Menin helps to keep cells in the body from growing and dividing too quickly. Many different changes in the MEN1 gene can cause the MEN 1 condition to develop. People who have one of those genetic changes can pass it on to their children. Many people with a change in the MEN1 gene inherit it from a parent. But some people are the first in their family to have a new MEN1 gene change that doesn't come from a parent. Risk factors for multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) include the following: ","Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) is a rare condition. It mainly causes tumors in the glands that make and release hormones. These are called the endocrine glands. The condition also can cause tumors in the small intestine and stomach. Another name for MEN 1 is Wermer's syndrome. The endocrine gland tumors that form due to MEN 1 usually are not cancer. Most often, the tumors grow on the parathyroid glands, the pancreas and the pituitary gland. Some glands affected by MEN 1 also may release too many hormones. That can lead to other health concerns. The extra hormones of MEN 1 can cause many symptoms. These symptoms may include tiredness, bone pain, broken bones, kidney stones, and ulcers in the stomach or intestines. MEN 1 can't be cured. But regular testing can detect health concerns, and healthcare professionals can provide treatment as needed. MEN 1 is an inherited condition.

They tend to be tall and thin with long arms and legs. Following are symptoms that may be related to each tumor type. Medullary thyroid cancer: Parathyroid hyperplasia, also known as primary hyperparathyroidism: Adrenal tumors, also known as pheochromocytoma: Symptoms may be caused by a thyroid tumor pressing on tissues around it or by the release of too many hormones in the body. Some people who have medullary thyroid cancer may have no symptoms. If you're having any of these symptoms, contact your health care provider. MEN 2is an inherited condition. This means someone who has a changed gene that can causeMEN 2can pass that gene on to their children. Many people also may be the first person in their families to have this disorder.

The extra calcium in the blood can cause many issues, including weak bones, called osteoporosis, kidney stones and having to urinate a lot. Medullary thyroid cancer shows up as a lump on the thyroid or neck. It can be hard to swallow when the tumor is large or other symptoms if the cancer spreads outside the neck. People withMEN 2also can have a condition called pheochromocytoma. This condition causes noncancerous tumors on an adrenal gland. The adrenal glands are located at the top of the kidneys.

Merkel cell carcinoma,"The first symptom of Merkel cell carcinoma most often is a growth on the skin. This skin cancer can happen anywhere on the body. It happens most often on skin that typically gets sunlight. In white people, the growth is most likely to be on the head or neck. In Black people, the growth more often is on the legs. A Merkel cell carcinoma can cause: Make an appointment with a healthcare professional if you have a mole, freckle or bump that changes size, shape or color. Also see a healthcare professional if you have a bump that grows fast or bleeds easily after minor injury, such as washing your skin or shaving. It's often not clear what causes Merkel cell carcinoma. This skin cancer happens when cells in the skin develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell the cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give other instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to grow and multiply at a fast rate.

In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. Merkel cell carcinoma is named for the cells where experts once thought it started. The Merkel cells are found at the bottom of the outer layer of skin. The Merkel cells are connected to the nerve endings in the skin that play a role in the sense of touch. Healthcare professionals no longer believe that this cancer starts in the Merkel cells. They don't know exactly what kind of cells it starts in. It's often not clear what causes the DNA changes that lead to Merkel cell carcinoma. Researchers have found that a common virus plays a role in causing Merkel cell carcinoma. The virus, called Merkel cell polyomavirus, lives on the skin. It doesn't cause symptoms. Experts don't know exactly how this virus causes Merkel cell carcinoma. Factors that may raise the risk of Merkel cell carcinoma include: Even with treatment, Merkel cell carcinoma often spreads to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, healthcare professionals sometimes say it metastasizes. Merkel cell carcinoma tends to travel first to nearby lymph nodes. Later it may spread to the brain, bones, liver or lungs. It can keep these organs from working as they should. Cancer that spreads is harder to treat and can be fatal. While exposure to sunlight isn't proved to cause all Merkel cell carcinomas, it is thought to be a risk factor for this cancer. Getting less sun exposure may lower your risk of skin cancer. Try to: For much of North America, the sun's rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. Plan to be outdoors at other times of the day, even during winter or when the sky is cloudy. When outside, stay in the shade as much as possible. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously. Reapply every two hours, or more often if you're swimming or sweating. To protect your skin from the sun, wear dark, tightly woven clothes that cover the arms and legs. Wear a wide-brimmed hat that shades the face and ears. Don't forget sunglasses. Look for sunglasses that block both types of ultraviolet light, also called UV light, that comes from the sun. The two types are UVA and UVB. Look at your skin often for new growths or changes in moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks. Use mirrors to check your face, neck, ears and scalp. Report any changes to your healthcare professional. Even though Merkel cell carcinoma most often is on the face, head and neck, look at other areas of your body. Look at your chest and trunk and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands. Look at the front and back of your legs and your feet. Look at the bottom of the feet and the spaces between your toes. Also check your genital area and between your buttocks. ","Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare type of skin cancer. It most often appears as a bump on the face, head or neck. Merkel cell carcinoma also is called neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. Merkel cell carcinoma most often happens in people older than 50.

The two types are UVA and UVB. Look at your skin often for new growths or changes in moles, freckles, bumps and birthmarks. Use mirrors to check your face, neck, ears and scalp. Report any changes to your healthcare professional. Even though Merkel cell carcinoma most often is on the face, head and neck, look at other areas of your body. Look at your chest and trunk and the tops and undersides of your arms and hands. Look at the front and back of your legs and your feet. Look at the bottom of the feet and the spaces between your toes. Also check your genital area and between your buttocks. "
Mitral valve prolapse,"Signs and symptoms of mitral valve prolapse are due to the amount of blood leaking backward through the valve.
Mitral valve prolapse symptoms can vary widely from one person to another. Many people with mitral valve prolapse don't have noticeable symptoms. Other people may have mild symptoms that develop gradually.
Symptoms of mitral valve prolapse may include:
If you have symptoms of mitral valve prolapse, make an appointment with your health care provider. Many other conditions can cause similar symptoms.
If you're having sudden or unusual chest pain or think you're having a heart attack, seek emergency medical care immediately.
If you've been diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse, see your provider if your symptoms worsen.","Mitral valve prolapse is a type of heart valve disease that affects the valve between the left heart chambers. The flaps (leaflets) of the mitral valve are floppy. They bulge backward (prolapse) like a parachute into the heart's left upper chamber as the heart squeezes (contracts).
Mitral (MY-trul) valve prolapse sometimes causes blood to leak backward across the valve, a condition called mitral valve regurgitation.
The mitral valve separates the two chambers (atrium and ventricle) of the left side of the heart. In mitral valve prolapse, the leaflets of the mitral valve bulge (prolapse) into the left atrium like a parachute during the heart's contraction. Sometimes mitral valve prolapse causes blood to leak back into the atrium from the ventricle, which is called mitral valve regurgitation.
Usually, mitral valve prolapse isn't life-threatening and doesn't require treatment or lifestyle changes. But some people may need medications or surgery, especially if the prolapse causes severe regurgitation.
Other names to describe mitral valve prolapse include:"
Molar pregnancy,"A molar pregnancy may seem like a regular pregnancy at first. But most molar pregnancies cause symptoms that can include: Because of improved ways of detecting a molar pregnancy, most are found in the first trimester. If it is not found in the first three months, symptoms of a molar pregnancy might include: An egg fertilized atypically causes a molar pregnancy. Human cells usually have 23 pairs of chromosomes. In a typical fertilization, one chromosome in each pair comes from the father, the other from the mother. In a complete molar pregnancy, one or two sperm fertilize an egg. The chromosomes from the mother's egg are missing or don't work. The father's chromosomes are copied. There's none from the mother. In a partial or incomplete molar pregnancy, the mother's chromosomes are present, but the father supplies two sets of chromosomes. The embryo then has 69 chromosomes instead of 46. This most often occurs when two sperm fertilize an egg, resulting in an extra copy of the father's genes. Factors that can contribute to a molar pregnancy include: After removing a molar pregnancy, molar tissue might remain and continue to grow. This is called persistent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN).GTNhappens more often in complete molar pregnancies than it does in partial molar pregnancies. One sign of persistentGTNis a high level of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) — a pregnancy hormone — after the molar pregnancy has been removed. In some cases, the mole that causes the molar pregnancy goes deep into the middle layer of the uterine wall. This causes bleeding from the vagina. PersistentGTNis usually treated with chemotherapy. Another treatment possibility is removal of the uterus, also known as hysterectomy. Rarely, a cancerous form ofGTNknown as choriocarcinoma develops and spreads to other organs. Choriocarcinoma is usually successfully treated with chemotherapy. A complete molar pregnancy is more likely to have this complication than is a partial molar pregnancy. If you've had a molar pregnancy, talk to your pregnancy care provider before trying to get pregnant again. You might want to wait six months to one year. The risk of having another molar pregnancy is low, but it's higher once you've had a molar pregnancy. During future pregnancies, a care provider may do early ultrasounds to check your condition and make sure the baby is developing. ","A molar pregnancy is a rare complication of pregnancy. It involves unusual growth of cells called trophoblasts. These cells typically become the organ that feeds a growing fetus. That organ also is known as the placenta. There are two types of molar pregnancy — complete molar pregnancy and partial molar pregnancy. In a complete molar pregnancy, the placental tissue swells and appears to form fluid-filled cysts. There is no fetus. In a partial molar pregnancy, the placenta might have both regular and irregular tissue. There may be a fetus, but the fetus can't survive. The fetus usually is miscarried early in the pregnancy. A molar pregnancy can have serious complications, including a rare form of cancer. A molar pregnancy requires early treatment. A molar pregnancy may seem like a regular pregnancy at first.

Moyamoya disease,"Moyamoya disease may occur at any age. But symptoms are most common in children between ages 5 and 10 and in adults between ages 30 and 50. Spotting symptoms early is very important to prevent complications such as a stroke. Moyamoya disease causes different symptoms in adults and children. In children, the first symptom is usually a stroke or recurrent transient ischemic attack (TIA). Adults may experience these symptoms, as well. But adults also may experience bleeding in the brain, known as a hemorrhagic stroke. The bleeding occurs because of the way blood vessels in the brain formed. Symptoms of moyamoya disease related to reduced blood flow to the brain include: These symptoms can be triggered by exercise, crying, coughing, straining or a fever. Seek immediate medical attentionif you notice any symptoms of a stroke or ministroke, even if they seem to come and go or disappear. Think ""FAST"" and do the following: Call 911 or your local emergency number right away. Don't wait to see if symptoms go away. Every minute counts. The longer a stroke goes untreated, the greater the potential for brain damage and disability. If you're with someone you suspect is having a stroke, watch the person carefully while waiting for emergency assistance. See your health care provider if you have any of the symptoms of moyamoya disease. Early detection and treatment can help prevent a stroke and serious complications. The exact cause of moyamoya disease is unknown. Moyamoya disease is most commonly seen in Japan, Korea and China. But it also occurs in other parts of the world. Researchers believe the greater prevalence in these Asian countries strongly suggests a genetic factor in some populations. Sometimes changes to the blood vessels, known as vascular changes, can occur that mimic moyamoya disease. These changes may have different causes and symptoms. This is known as moyamoya syndrome. Moyamoya syndrome is also associated with certain conditions, such as Down syndrome, sickle cell anemia, neurofibromatosis type 1 and hyperthyroidism. Though the cause of moyamoya disease is unknown, certain factors may increase your risk of having the condition. They include: Most complications from moyamoya disease are associated with the effects of strokes. They include seizures, paralysis and vision problems. Other complications include speech problems, movement disorders and developmental delays. Moyamoya disease can cause serious and permanent damage to the brain. ","Moyamoya disease is a rare blood vessel disorder in which the carotid artery in the skull becomes blocked or narrowed. The carotid artery is a major artery that brings blood to the brain. When it's blocked, blood flow to the brain is reduced. Tiny blood vessels then develop at the base of the brain in an attempt to supply the brain with blood. The condition may cause a ministroke, known as atransient ischemic attack, or astroke. It also can cause bleeding in the brain. Moyamoya disease can affect how well the brain functions and can cause cognitive and developmental delays or disability. Moyamoya disease most commonly affects children. However, adults may have the condition as well. Moyamoya disease is found all over the world. But it's more common in East Asian countries, especially Korea, Japan and China. This may be due to certain genetic factors in those populations. Moyamoya disease may occur at any age.

Myasthenia gravis,"Muscle weakness caused by myasthenia gravis gets worse when the affected muscle is used. Because symptoms usually get better with rest, muscle weakness can come and go. However, the symptoms tend to progress over time. They usually reach their worst within a few years after the disease begins. Myasthenia gravis may affect any of the muscles that you can control. Certain muscle groups are more commonly affected than others. In more than half the people who develop myasthenia gravis, their first symptoms affect the eyes. Symptoms include: In about 15% of people with myasthenia gravis, the first symptoms involve face and throat muscles. These symptoms can: Myasthenia gravis also can cause weakness in the neck, arms and legs. Weakness in the legs can affect how you walk. Weak neck muscles make it hard to hold up the head. Talk to your health care provider if you have problems: Your nerves communicate with your muscles by releasing chemicals, called neurotransmitters, that fit into places on the muscle cells, called receptor sites, at the nerve-muscle junction. In myasthenia gravis, the immune system makes antibodies that block or destroy many of your muscles' receptor sites for a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine (as-uh-teel-KOH-leen). With fewer receptor sites available, your muscles receive fewer nerve signals. This causes weakness. Antibodies also can block a protein called muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (TIE-roh-seen KIE-nays), sometimes referred to as MuSK. This protein helps form the nerve-muscle junction. Antibodies against this protein can lead to myasthenia gravis. Antibodies against another protein, called lipoprotein-related protein 4 (LRP4), can play a part in this condition. Research studies have found other antibodies and the number of antibodies involved will likely grow over time. Some people have myasthenia gravis that isn't caused by antibodies blocking acetylcholine,MuSKorLRP4. This type of myasthenia gravis is called seronegative myasthenia gravis, also known as antibody-negative myasthenia gravis. In general, researchers believe that this type of myasthenia gravis still comes from a problem with autoimmunity, but the antibodies involved just can't be found yet. The thymus gland is a part of your immune system. This gland is located in the upper chest beneath the breastbone. Researchers believe that the thymus gland makes or helps produce the antibodies that block acetylcholine. The thymus gland is large in babies and small in healthy adults. In some adults with myasthenia gravis, however, the thymus gland is larger than usual. Some people with myasthenia gravis also have tumors of the thymus gland, called thymomas. Usually, thymomas aren't cancerous, also known as malignant. But thymomas can become cancerous. Rarely, mothers with myasthenia gravis have children who are born with myasthenia gravis. This is called neonatal myasthenia gravis. If treated immediately, children usually recover within two months after birth. Some children are born with a rare, hereditary form of myasthenia gravis, called congenital myasthenic syndrome. Factors that can make myasthenia gravis worse include: Complications of myasthenia gravis are treatable, but some can be life-threatening. Myasthenic crisis is a life-threatening condition. It happens when the muscles that control breathing become too weak to work. Emergency treatment and mechanical assistance with breathing are needed. Medicines and therapies that filter the blood help people to breathe on their own. Some people with myasthenia gravis have a tumor in the thymus gland. The thymus is a gland under the breastbone that is part of the immune system. Most of these tumors, called thymomas, aren't cancerous. People with myasthenia gravis are more likely to have the following conditions: ","Myasthenia gravis (my-us-THEE-nee-uh GRAY-vis) causes muscles under your voluntary control to feel weak and get tired quickly. This happens when the communication between nerves and muscles breaks down. There's no cure for myasthenia gravis. Treatment can help with symptoms. These symptoms can include weakness of arm or leg muscles, double vision, drooping eyelids, and problems with speaking, chewing, swallowing and breathing.

Occupational asthma,"Occupational asthma symptoms may include: Other possible symptoms may include: Occupational asthma symptoms depend on the substance you're exposed to, how long and how often you're exposed, and other factors. Your symptoms may: Seek medical treatment right away if your symptoms worsen. Severe asthma attacks can be life-threatening. Symptoms of an asthma attack that need emergency treatment include: Make an appointment to see your healthcare professional if you have breathing problems, such as coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath, especially if the symptoms don't go away or worsen. More than 400 workplace substances have been identified as possible triggers of occupational asthma. These substances include: Asthma symptoms start when your lungs become irritated. This irritation causes an immune system reaction called inflammation. Inflammation is defined as swelling and other changes in airway tissues caused by immune system activity. These changes narrow the airways and make it difficult to breathe. With occupational asthma, lung inflammation may be triggered by a substance that a person is allergic to, such as mold or an animal protein. Sometimes lung inflammation is triggered by an irritating substance, also called an irritant, such as chlorine or smoke. The more you're exposed to an irritant, the greater the risk of developing occupational asthma. In addition, you will have increased risk if: It's possible to develop occupational asthma in almost any workplace. But your risk is higher in certain workplaces. Some of the riskiest jobs linked to asthma-producing substances include the following: The longer you're exposed to a substance that can cause occupational asthma, the worse your symptoms may become. Also, the longer you're exposed, the longer it will take for symptoms to improve after exposure stops. In some cases, exposure to airborne asthma triggers can cause permanent changes to your lungs. The best way to prevent occupational asthma is to control exposure to chemicals and other substances that are known to be irritating. Workplaces can set up controls to prevent exposures, use less harmful substances and provide personal protective equipment (PPE) for workers. Medicines may help relieve symptoms and control inflammation linked to occupational asthma. But you can do several things on your own to be healthy and lessen the possibility of attacks: If you are in the United States and you have a high-risk job, your company must follow rules to help protect you from harmful chemicals. Under guidelines from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), your employer is required to do the following: UnderOSHAguidelines, your employer is required to keep a material safety data sheet (MSDS) for each harmful chemical used in your workplace. This is a document that must be submitted by the chemical's manufacturer to your employer. You have a legal right to see and copy such documents. If you suspect you're allergic to a certain substance, show theMSDSto your healthcare professional. While at work, watch for conditions that may not be safe or healthy. Report concerns to your supervisor. If necessary, callOSHAat800-321-OSHA(800-321-6742) and ask for an on-site inspection. You can do this so that your name won't be revealed to your employer. ","Occupational asthma is a type of asthma caused by breathing in fumes, gases, dust or other substances while on the job. These substances can trigger an immune system response that changes how the lungs work. Occupational asthma also is called work-related asthma. In asthma, the airways narrow and swell. They also may make extra mucus. This makes it difficult to breathe and may cause chest tightness, wheezing and shortness of breath. Avoiding triggers is important for managing occupational asthma. Treatment includes medicines that reduce symptoms. For people who were diagnosed with asthma in the past, medicines may help improve symptoms related to workplace triggers. If occupational asthma is not treated and triggers are not avoided, the asthma can cause permanent changes to the lungs.

Osteoporosis,"There typically are no symptoms in the early stages of bone loss. But once your bones have been weakened by osteoporosis, you might have signs and symptoms that include: You might want to talk to your health care provider about osteoporosis if you went through early menopause or took corticosteroids for several months at a time, or if either of your parents had hip fractures. Your bones are in a constant state of renewal — new bone is made and old bone is broken down. When you're young, your body makes new bone faster than it breaks down old bone and your bone mass increases. After the early 20s this process slows, and most people reach their peak bone mass by age 30. As people age, bone mass is lost faster than it's created. How likely you are to develop osteoporosis depends partly on how much bone mass you attained in your youth. Peak bone mass is partly inherited and varies also by ethnic group. The higher your peak bone mass, the more bone you have ""in the bank"" and the less likely you are to develop osteoporosis as you age. A number of factors can increase the likelihood that you'll develop osteoporosis — including your age, race, lifestyle choices, and medical conditions and treatments. Some risk factors for osteoporosis are out of your control, including: Osteoporosis is more common in people who have too much or too little of certain hormones in their bodies. Examples include: Osteoporosis is more likely to occur in people who have: Long-term use of oral or injected corticosteroid medicines, such as prednisone and cortisone, interferes with the bone-rebuilding process. Osteoporosis has also been associated with medications used to combat or prevent: The risk of osteoporosis is higher in people who have certain medical problems, including: Some bad habits can increase your risk of osteoporosis. Examples include: Bone breaks, particularly in the spine or hip, are the most serious complications of osteoporosis. Hip fractures often are caused by a fall and can result in disability and even an increased risk of death within the first year after the injury. In some cases, broken bones in the spine can occur even if you haven't fallen. The bones that make up your spine, called vertebrae, can weaken to the point of collapsing, which can result in back pain, lost height and a hunched-forward posture. Good nutrition and regular exercise are essential for keeping your bones healthy throughout your life. Men and women between the ages of 18 and 50 need 1,000 milligrams of calcium a day. This daily amount increases to 1,200 milligrams when women turn 50 and men turn 70. Good sources of calcium include: If you find it difficult to get enough calcium from your diet, consider taking calcium supplements. However, too much calcium has been linked to kidney stones. Although yet unclear, some experts suggest that too much calcium, especially in supplements, can increase the risk of heart disease. The Health and Medicine Division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommends that total calcium intake, from supplements and diet combined, should be no more than 2,000 milligrams daily for people older than 50. Vitamin D improves the body's ability to absorb calcium and improves bone health in other ways. People can get some of their vitamin D from sunlight, but this might not be a good source if you live in a high latitude, if you're housebound, or if you regularly use sunscreen or avoid the sun because of the risk of skin cancer. Dietary sources of vitamin D include cod liver oil, trout and salmon. Many types of milk and cereal have been fortified with vitamin D. Most people need at least 600 international units (IU) of vitamin D a day. That recommendation increases to 800IUa day after age 70. People without other sources of vitamin D and especially with limited sun exposure might need a supplement. Most multivitamin products contain between 600 and 800IUof vitamin D. Up to 4,000IUof vitamin D a day is safe for most people. Exercise can help you build strong bones and slow bone loss. Exercise will benefit your bones no matter when you start, but you'll gain the most benefits if you start exercising regularly when you're young and continue to exercise throughout your life. Combine strength training exercises with weight-bearing and balance exercises. Strength training helps strengthen muscles and bones in your arms and upper spine. Weight-bearing exercises — such as walking, jogging, running, stair climbing, skipping rope, skiing and impact-producing sports — affect mainly the bones in your legs, hips and lower spine. Balance exercises such as tai chi can reduce your risk of falling especially as you get older. ","Osteoporosis causes bones to become weak and brittle — so brittle that a fall or even mild stresses such as bending over or coughing can cause a break. Osteoporosis-related breaks most commonly occur in the hip, wrist or spine. Bone is living tissue that is constantly being broken down and replaced. Osteoporosis occurs when the creation of new bone doesn't keep up with the loss of old bone. Osteoporosis affects men and women of all races. But white and Asian women, especially older women who are past menopause, are at highest risk. Medicines, healthy diet and weight-bearing exercise can help prevent bone loss or strengthen already weak bones. There typically are no symptoms in the early stages of bone loss. But once your bones have been weakened by osteoporosis, you might have signs and symptoms that include: You might want to talk to your health care provider about osteoporosis if you went through early menopause or took corticosteroids for several months at a time, or if either of your parents had hip fractures. Your bones are in a constant state of renewal — new bone is made and old bone is broken down. When you're young, your body makes new bone faster than it breaks down old bone and your bone mass increases. After the early 20s this process slows, and most people reach their peak bone mass by age 30. As people age, bone mass is lost faster than it's created. How likely you are to develop osteoporosis depends partly on how much bone mass you attained in your youth. Peak bone mass is partly inherited and varies also by ethnic group. The higher your peak bone mass, the more bone you have ""in the bank"" and the less likely you are to develop osteoporosis as you age. A number of factors can increase the likelihood that you'll develop osteoporosis — including your age, race, lifestyle choices, and medical conditions and treatments. Some risk factors for osteoporosis are out of your control, including: Osteoporosis is more common in people who have too much or too little of certain hormones in their bodies. Examples include: Osteoporosis is more likely to occur in people who have: Long-term use of oral or injected corticosteroid medicines, such as prednisone and cortisone, interferes with the bone-rebuilding process. Osteoporosis has also been associated with medications used to combat or prevent: The risk of osteoporosis is higher in people who have certain medical problems, including: Some bad habits can increase your risk of osteoporosis. Examples include: Bone breaks, particularly in the spine or hip, are the most serious complications of osteoporosis. Hip fractures often are caused by a fall and can result in disability and even an increased risk of death within the first year after the injury. In some cases, broken bones in the spine can occur even if you haven't fallen. The bones that make up your spine, called vertebrae, can weaken to the point of collapsing, which can result in back pain, lost height and a hunched-forward posture. Good nutrition and regular exercise are essential for keeping your bones healthy throughout your life. Men and women between the ages of 18 and 50 need 1,000 milligrams of calcium a day. This daily amount increases to 1,200 milligrams when women turn 50 and men turn 70. Good sources of calcium include: If you find it difficult to get enough calcium from your diet, consider taking calcium supplements. However, too much calcium has been linked to kidney stones. Although yet unclear, some experts suggest that too much calcium, especially in supplements, can increase the risk of heart disease. The Health and Medicine Division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommends that total calcium intake, from supplements and diet combined, should be no more than 2,000 milligrams daily for people older than 50. Vitamin D improves the body's ability to absorb calcium and improves bone health in other ways. People can get some of their vitamin D from sunlight, but this might not be a good source if you live in a high latitude, if you're housebound, or if you regularly use sunscreen or avoid the sun because of the risk of skin cancer. Dietary sources of vitamin D include cod liver oil, trout and salmon. Many types of milk and cereal have been fortified with vitamin D. Most people need at least 600 international units (IU) of vitamin D a day. That recommendation increases to 800IUa day after age 70. People without other sources of vitamin D and especially with limited sun exposure might need a supplement. Most multivitamin products contain between 600 and 800IUof vitamin D. Up to 4,000IUof vitamin D a day is safe for most people. Exercise can help you build strong bones and slow bone loss. Exercise will benefit your bones no matter when you start, but you'll gain the most benefits if you start exercising regularly when you're young and continue to exercise throughout your life. Combine strength training exercises with weight-bearing and balance exercises. Strength training helps strengthen muscles and bones in your arms and upper spine. Weight-bearing exercises — such as walking, jogging, running, stair climbing, skipping rope, skiing and impact-producing sports — affect mainly the bones in your legs, hips and lower spine. Balance exercises such as tai chi can reduce your risk of falling especially as you get older. "
Osteosarcoma,"Osteosarcoma signs and symptoms most often start in a bone. The cancer most often affects the long bones of the legs, and sometimes the arms. The most common symptoms include: Make an appointment with a healthcare professional if you or your child has ongoing symptoms that worry you. Osteosarcoma symptoms are like those of many more common conditions, such as sports injuries. The health professional might check for those causes first. It's not clear what causes osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma happens when bone cells develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions, called genes, that tell a cell what to do. In healthy cells, the DNA gives instructions to grow and multiply at a set rate. The instructions tell the cells to die at a set time. In cancer cells, the DNA changes give different instructions. The changes tell the cancer cells to make many more cells quickly. Cancer cells can keep living when healthy cells would die. This causes too many cells. The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer spreads, it's called metastatic cancer. Most people with osteosarcoma don't have any known risk factors for the cancer. But these factors can increase the risk of osteosarcoma: There is no way to prevent osteosarcoma. Complications of osteosarcoma and its treatment include the following. Osteosarcoma can spread from where it started to other areas. This makes treatment and recovery harder. Osteosarcoma most often spreads to the lungs, the same bone or another bone. Surgeons aim to remove the cancer and spare the arm or leg when they can. But sometimes surgeons need to remove part of the affected limb to remove all the cancer. Learning to use an artificial limb, called a prosthesis, takes time, practice and patience. Experts can help. The strong treatments needed to control osteosarcoma can cause major side effects, both in the short and long term. Your healthcare team can help you or your child manage the side effects that happen during treatment. The team also can give you a list of side effects to watch for in the years after treatment. ","Osteosarcoma is a kind of cancer that begins in the cells that form bones. Osteosarcoma tends to happen most often in teenagers and young adults. But it also can happen in younger children and older adults. Osteosarcoma can start in any bone. It's most often found in the long bones of the legs, and sometimes the arms. Very rarely, it happens in soft tissue outside the bone. Advances in the treatment of osteosarcoma have improved the outlook for this cancer. After treatment for osteosarcoma, people sometimes face late effects from the strong treatments used to control the cancer. Healthcare professionals often suggest lifelong monitoring for side effects after treatment. Osteosarcoma signs and symptoms most often start in a bone.

Overactive bladder,"If you have an overactive bladder, you may: Even if you can get to the toilet in time when you feel an urge to urinate, having to urinate often during day and night can disrupt your life. Although common among older adults, overactive bladder isn't a typical part of aging. It might not be easy to talk about your symptoms. But if the symptoms distress you or disrupt your life, talk to your healthcare professional. There are treatments that might help. The kidneys make urine, which drains into the bladder. When urinating, urine passes from the bladder through a tube called the urethra (u-REE-thruh). A muscle in the urethra called the sphincter opens to release urine out of the body. In people assigned female at birth, the urethral opening is just above the vaginal opening. In people assigned male at birth, the urethral opening is at the tip of the penis. As the bladder fills, nerve signals sent to the brain trigger the need to urinate. When urinating, these nerve signals cause the pelvic floor muscles and the muscles of the urethra, called the urinary sphincter muscles, to relax. The muscles of the bladder tighten, also called contract, pushing the urine out. Overactive bladder happens when the muscles of the bladder start to tighten on their own even when the amount of urine in the bladder is low. These are called involuntary contractions. They cause an urgent need to urinate. Several conditions may be a part of overactive bladder, including: Overactive bladder symptoms also may be linked to: Sometimes the cause of overactive bladder isn't known. Aging increases the risk of overactive bladder. So does being female. Conditions such as enlarged prostate and diabetes also can increase the risk. Many people with declines in thinking ability, such as those who have had a stroke or have Alzheimer's disease, get an overactive bladder. That's because they're less able to notice the symptoms of needing to urinate. Drinking fluids on a schedule, timing and prompting urination, absorbent garments, and bowel programs can help manage the condition. Some people with an overactive bladder also have trouble with bowel control. Tell your healthcare professional if you're having trouble controlling your bowels. Any type of incontinence can affect quality of life. If your overactive bladder symptoms disrupt your life, you might also have: People assigned female at birth who have an overactive bladder also may have a condition called mixed incontinence. This has both urgency and stress incontinence. Stress incontinence is the sudden loss of urine from physical movement or activity that puts pressure on the bladder. Examples are coughing, sneezing, laughing or exercising. These healthy lifestyle choices may reduce your risk of overactive bladder: ","Overactive bladder, also called OAB, causes sudden urges to urinate that may be hard to control. There might be a need to pass urine many times during the day and night. There also might be loss of urine that isn't intended, called urgency incontinence. People with an overactive bladder might feel self-conscious. That can cause them to keep away from others or limit their work and social life. The good news is that it can be treated. Simple behavior changes might manage symptoms of an overactive bladder. These might include changes in diet, urinating on a certain schedule and using pelvic floor muscles to control the bladder.

Pancreatic cancer,"Pancreatic cancer often doesn't cause symptoms until the disease is advanced. When they happen, signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer may include: Make an appointment with a health care professional if you have symptoms that worry you. It's not clear what causes pancreatic cancer. Doctors have found some factors that might raise the risk of this type of cancer. These include smoking and having a family history of pancreatic cancer. The pancreas is about 6 inches (15 centimeters) long and looks something like a pear lying on its side. It releases hormones, including insulin. These hormones help the body process the sugar in the foods you eat. The pancreas also makes digestive juices to help the body digest food and take in nutrients. Pancreatic cancer happens when cells in the pancreas develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. In healthy cells, the instructions tell the cells to grow and multiply at a set rate. The cells die at a set time. In cancer cells, the changes give different instructions.

The cancer cells might form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade and destroy healthy body tissue. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. Most pancreatic cancer begins in the cells that line the ducts of the pancreas. This type of cancer is called pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma or pancreatic exocrine cancer. Less often, cancer can form in the hormone-producing cells or the neuroendocrine cells of the pancreas. These types of cancer are called pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors or pancreatic endocrine cancer. Factors that might raise the risk of pancreatic cancer include: As pancreatic cancer progresses, it can cause complications such as: Screening uses tests to look for signs of pancreatic cancer in people who don't have symptoms. It might be an option if you have a very high risk of pancreatic cancer. Your risk might be high if you have a strong family history of pancreatic cancer or if you have an inherited DNA change that increases the risk of cancer. Pancreatic cancer screening might involve imaging tests, such as MRI and ultrasound. These tests are generally repeated every year. The goal of screening is to find pancreatic cancer when it's small and most likely to be cured. Research is ongoing, so it's not yet clear whether screening can lower the risk of dying of pancreatic cancer. There are risks to screening. This includes the chance of finding something that requires surgery but later turns out to not be cancer. Talk about the benefits and risks of pancreatic cancer screening with your health care team. Together you can decide whether screening is right for you. If you have a family history of pancreatic cancer, discuss it with a health care professional. The health professional can review your family history and help you understand whether genetic testing might be right for you. Genetic testing can find DNA changes that run in families and increase the risk of cancer. If you're interested in genetic testing, you might be referred to a genetic counselor or other health care professional trained in genetics.

The most common type of pancreatic cancer is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. This type begins in the cells that line the ducts that carry digestive enzymes out of the pancreas. Pancreatic cancer rarely is found at its early stages when the chance of curing it is greatest. This is because it often doesn't cause symptoms until after it has spread to other organs.

Pilonidal cyst,"A pilonidal cyst may not cause symptoms. But if it's infected, the skin around the cyst may be swollen and painful. Symptoms of an infected pilonidal cyst include: If you notice any symptoms of a pilonidal cyst, see your health care provider. The cause of most pilonidal cysts is loose hairs that puncture the skin. Friction and pressure from rubbed skin, tight clothing, cycling or long periods of sitting can force hair into the skin. The body creates a cyst around the hair to try to push it out. Most pilonidal cysts form on the tailbone. People who groom animals or cut hair can develop a cyst between their fingers. Factors that might increase your risk of a pilonidal cyst include: Some people have pilonidal cysts that become infected again and again over a long time. Without treatment, these people may be at increased risk of a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma. To help prevent pilonidal cysts, try to: If you've had pilonidal cysts in the past, you might want to regularly shave the affected area or use hair removal products to reduce the risk of a new cyst. ","A pilonidal (pie-low-NIE-dul) cyst is an unusual pocket in the skin that usually contains hair and skin debris. The cyst is almost always near the tailbone at the top of the buttocks. Pilonidal cysts usually occur when hair punctures the skin and then becomes embedded. If a pilonidal cyst becomes infected, it can be very painful. The cyst can be drained through a small cut in the skin. Sometimes, surgery is needed. Pilonidal cysts are most common in young adult males, and the problem tends to recur. People who sit for long periods of time are at higher risk of developing pilonidal cysts. A pilonidal cyst may not cause symptoms.

Polycythemia vera,"Many people with polycythemia vera don't have noticeable signs or symptoms. Some people might develop vague symptoms such as headache, dizziness, fatigue and blurred vision.
More-specific symptoms of polycythemia vera include:
Make an appointment with your doctor if you have signs or symptoms of polycythemia vera.","Polycythemia vera (pol-e-sy-THEE-me-uh VEER-uh) is a type of blood cancer. It causes your bone marrow to make too many red blood cells. These excess cells thicken your blood, slowing its flow, which may cause serious problems, such as blood clots.
Polycythemia vera is rare. It usually develops slowly, and you might have it for years without knowing. Often the condition is found during a blood test done for another reason.
Without treatment, polycythemia vera can be life-threatening. But proper medical care can help ease signs, symptoms and complications of this disease."
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),"Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may start within the first three months after a traumatic event. But sometimes symptoms may not appear until years after the event. These symptoms last more than one month and cause major problems in social or work situations and how well you get along with others. They also can affect your ability to do your usual daily tasks. Generally,PTSDsymptoms are grouped into four types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions. Symptoms can vary over time or vary from person to person. Symptoms of intrusive memories may include: Symptoms of avoidance may include: Symptoms of negative changes in thinking and mood may include: Symptoms of changes in physical and emotional reactions, also called arousal symptoms, may include: For children 6 years old and younger, symptoms also may include: Over time,PTSDsymptoms can vary in how severe they are. You may have morePTSDsymptoms when you're generally stressed or when you come across reminders of what you went through, including the same time of year when a past traumatic event happened. For example, you may hear a car backfire and relive combat experiences. Or you may see a report on the news about a sexual assault and feel overcome by memories of your assault. Talk to your healthcare professional or a mental health professional if you have disturbing thoughts and feelings about a traumatic event for more than a month, especially if they're severe. Also, see a health professional if you're having trouble getting your life back under control. Getting treatment as soon as possible can help preventPTSDsymptoms from getting worse. If you or someone you know has suicidal thoughts, get help right away: If you think you may hurt yourself or attempt suicide, call 911 or your local emergency number right away. If you know someone who's in danger of attempting suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person for safety. Call 911 or your local emergency number right away. Or, if you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency department. You can develop post-traumatic stress disorder when you go through, see or learn about an event involving actual or threatened death, serious injury or sexual assault.

HavingPTSDalso may raise your risk of other mental health problems, such as: After surviving a traumatic event, many people havePTSD-like symptoms at first, such as not being able to stop thinking about what's happened. Fear, anxiety, anger, depression and guilt are all common reactions to trauma. But most people exposed to trauma don't go on to developPTSD. Getting timely help and support may prevent usual stress reactions from getting worse and leading toPTSD. This may mean turning to family and friends who will listen and offer comfort. It also may mean seeking out a mental health professional for a brief course of therapy. Some people also may find it helpful to turn to their faith communities. Support from others also may prevent you from turning to unhealthy coping methods, such as misusing alcohol or drugs. ","Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that's caused by an extremely stressful or terrifying event — either being part of it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety and uncontrollable thoughts about the event. Most people who go through traumatic events may have a hard time adjusting and coping for a short time. But with time and by taking good care of themselves, they usually get better. If the symptoms get worse, last for months or years, and affect their ability to function daily, they may havePTSD. Getting treatment afterPTSDsymptoms arise can be very important to ease symptoms and help people function better.

Postherpetic neuralgia,"In general, the symptoms of postherpetic neuralgia are limited to the area of skin where the shingles outbreak first happened. That's commonly in a band around the trunk of the body, most often on one side. The symptoms might include: See a health care provider at the first sign of shingles. Often the pain starts before you notice a rash. The risk of postherpetic neuralgia becomes lower if you start taking virus-fighting medicines called antivirals within 72 hours of getting the shingles rash. The chickenpox virus causes shingles. Once you've had chickenpox, the virus stays in your body for the rest of your life. The virus can become active again and cause shingles. This risk goes up with age. The risk also rises if something turns down the body's immune system, such as chemotherapy medicines to treat cancer. Postherpetic neuralgia happens if nerve fibers get damaged during an outbreak of shingles. Damaged fibers can't send messages from the skin to the brain as they usually do. Instead, the messages become confused and heightened. This causes pain that can last months or even years. With shingles, things that can raise the risk of postherpetic neuralgia are: People with postherpetic neuralgia can develop other problems that are common with long-term pain. It depends on how long the postherpetic neuralgia lasts and how painful it is. These other problems can include: Shingles vaccines can help prevent shingles and postherpetic neuralgia. Ask your health care provider when you should get a vaccine. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that adults 50 and older get a shingles vaccine called Shingrix. The agency also suggests Shingrix for adults 19 and older who have weaker immune systems because of diseases or treatments. Shingrix is suggested even if you've already had shingles or the older vaccine, Zostavax. Shingrix is given in two doses, 2 to 6 months apart. With two doses, Shingrix is more than 90% effective in preventing shingles and postherpetic neuralgia. Other shingles vaccines are offered outside of the United States. Talk to your provider for more information on how well they prevent shingles and postherpetic neuralgia. ","Postherpetic neuralgia (post-hur-PET-ik noo-RAL-juh) is the most common complication of shingles. It causes a burning pain in nerves and skin. The pain lasts long after the rash and blisters of shingles go away. The risk of postherpetic neuralgia rises with age. It mainly affects people older than 60. There's no cure, but treatments can ease symptoms. For most people, postherpetic neuralgia gets better over time. In general, the symptoms of postherpetic neuralgia are limited to the area of skin where the shingles outbreak first happened. That's commonly in a band around the trunk of the body, most often on one side. The symptoms might include: See a health care provider at the first sign of shingles. Often the pain starts before you notice a rash. The risk of postherpetic neuralgia becomes lower if you start taking virus-fighting medicines called antivirals within 72 hours of getting the shingles rash. The chickenpox virus causes shingles. Once you've had chickenpox, the virus stays in your body for the rest of your life. The virus can become active again and cause shingles. This risk goes up with age. The risk also rises if something turns down the body's immune system, such as chemotherapy medicines to treat cancer. Postherpetic neuralgia happens if nerve fibers get damaged during an outbreak of shingles. Damaged fibers can't send messages from the skin to the brain as they usually do. Instead, the messages become confused and heightened. This causes pain that can last months or even years. With shingles, things that can raise the risk of postherpetic neuralgia are: People with postherpetic neuralgia can develop other problems that are common with long-term pain. It depends on how long the postherpetic neuralgia lasts and how painful it is. These other problems can include: Shingles vaccines can help prevent shingles and postherpetic neuralgia. Ask your health care provider when you should get a vaccine. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that adults 50 and older get a shingles vaccine called Shingrix. The agency also suggests Shingrix for adults 19 and older who have weaker immune systems because of diseases or treatments. Shingrix is suggested even if you've already had shingles or the older vaccine, Zostavax. Shingrix is given in two doses, 2 to 6 months apart. With two doses, Shingrix is more than 90% effective in preventing shingles and postherpetic neuralgia. Other shingles vaccines are offered outside of the United States.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis,"Primary sclerosing cholangitis is often diagnosed before symptoms appear when a routine blood test or an X-ray taken for an unrelated condition shows liver abnormalities. Early signs and symptoms often include: Many people diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis before they have symptoms continue to feel generally well for several years. But there's no reliable way to predict how quickly or slowly the disease will progress for any individual. Signs and symptoms that may appear as the disease progresses include: Make an appointment with your doctor if you have severe, unexplained itching on much of your body — itching that persists no matter how much you scratch. Also see your doctor if you feel extremely tired all the time, no matter what you do. It's particularly important to bring unexplained fatigue and itching to your doctor's attention if you have ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, both of which are types of inflammatory bowel disease. A majority of people with primary sclerosing cholangitis also have one of these diseases. It's not clear what causes primary sclerosing cholangitis. An immune system reaction to an infection or toxin may trigger the disease in people who are genetically predisposed to it. A large proportion of people with primary sclerosing cholangitis also have inflammatory bowel disease, an umbrella term that includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease don't always appear at the same time, though. In some cases, primary sclerosing cholangitis is present for years before inflammatory bowel disease occurs. If primary sclerosing cholangitis is diagnosed, it's important to look for inflammatory bowel disease because there is a greater risk of colon cancer. Somewhat less often, people being treated for inflammatory bowel disease turn out to have primary sclerosing cholangitis as well. And rarely, people with primary sclerosing cholangitis develop inflammatory bowel disease only after having a liver transplant. Factors that may increase the risk of primary sclerosing cholangitis include: Complications of primary sclerosing cholangitis may include: ","Primary sclerosing (skluh-ROHS-ing) cholangitis (koh-lan-JIE-tis) is a disease of the bile ducts. Bile ducts carry the digestive liquid bile from your liver to your small intestine. In primary sclerosing cholangitis, inflammation causes scars within the bile ducts. These scars make the ducts hard and narrow and gradually cause serious liver damage. A majority of people with primary sclerosing cholangitis also have inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. In most people with primary sclerosing cholangitis, the disease progresses slowly. It can eventually lead to liver failure, repeated infections, and tumors of the bile duct or liver. A liver transplant is the only known cure for advanced primary sclerosing cholangitis, but the disease may recur in the transplanted liver in a small number of patients. Care for primary sclerosing cholangitis focuses on monitoring liver function, managing symptoms and, when possible, doing procedures that temporarily open blocked bile ducts. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is often diagnosed before symptoms appear when a routine blood test or an X-ray taken for an unrelated condition shows liver abnormalities.

Prostate cancer,"Prostate cancer may cause no signs or symptoms in its early stages. Prostate cancer that's more advanced may cause signs and symptoms such as: Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any persistent signs or symptoms that worry you. It's not clear what causes prostate cancer. Doctors know that prostate cancer begins when cells in the prostate develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The changes tell the cells to grow and divide more rapidly than normal cells do. The abnormal cells continue living, when other cells would die. The accumulating abnormal cells form a tumor that can grow to invade nearby tissue. In time, some abnormal cells can break away and spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. Factors that can increase your risk of prostate cancer include: Complications of prostate cancer and its treatments include: You can reduce your risk of prostate cancer if you: ","Prostate cancer is cancer that occurs in the prostate. The prostate is a small walnut-shaped gland in males that produces the seminal fluid that nourishes and transports sperm. Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. Many prostate cancers grow slowly and are confined to the prostate gland, where they may not cause serious harm. However, while some types of prostate cancer grow slowly and may need minimal or even no treatment, other types are aggressive and can spread quickly. Prostate cancer that's detected early — when it's still confined to the prostate gland — has the best chance for successful treatment.

Prostatitis,Signs and symptoms of prostatitis can vary depending on the type of disorder. They may include: Several conditions can contribute to the signs and symptoms associated with prostatitis. It's important to get an accurate diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible. Get immediate care if you have any of the following: Causes vary depending on the type of prostatitis. Risk factors for prostatitis include: Additional risk factors for chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome may include: Complications of acute or chronic prostatitis can include: Complications of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome may include: There's no direct evidence that prostatitis can lead to prostate cancer. Researchers are investigating whether chronic inflammation of the prostate is a risk factor for cancer. ,"Prostatitis is a disorder of the prostate gland usually associated with inflammation. Prostatitis often causes painful or difficult urination, as well as pain in the groin, pelvic area or genitals. Bacterial infections cause some but not all cases of prostatitis. The prostate gland, about the size of a walnut, is located just below the bladder in men. It surrounds the top portion of the tube that drains urine from the bladder (urethra). The prostate and other sex glands produce the fluid that transports sperm during ejaculation (semen). There are generally four types of prostatitis: Signs and symptoms of prostatitis can vary depending on the type of disorder. They may include: Several conditions can contribute to the signs and symptoms associated with prostatitis. It's important to get an accurate diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible.

Pulmonary edema,"Pulmonary edema symptoms may appear suddenly or develop over time. Symptoms depend on the type of pulmonary edema.
high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) can occur in adults and children who travel to or exercise at high altitudes. Symptoms are similar to those that occur with acute pulmonary edema and can include:
Symptoms of high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) tend to get worse at night.
Pulmonary edema that comes on suddenly (acute pulmonary edema) is life-threatening. Call 911 or emergency medical help if you have any of the following acute symptoms:
Don't drive yourself to the hospital. Instead, call 911 or emergency medical care and wait for help.","Pulmonary edema is a condition caused by too much fluid in the lungs. This fluid collects in the many air sacs in the lungs, making it difficult to breathe.
In most cases, heart problems cause pulmonary edema. But fluid can collect in the lungs for other reasons. These include pneumonia, contact with certain toxins, medications, trauma to the chest wall, and traveling to or exercising at high elevations.
Pulmonary edema that develops suddenly (acute pulmonary edema) is a medical emergency that needs immediate care. Pulmonary edema can sometimes cause death. Prompt treatment might help. Treatment for pulmonary edema depends on the cause but generally includes additional oxygen and medications."
Pulmonary embolism,"Pulmonary embolism symptoms can vary greatly, depending on how much of your lung is involved, the size of the clots, and whether you have underlying lung or heart disease. Common symptoms include: Other symptoms that can occur with pulmonary embolism include: A pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening. Seek urgent medical attention if you experience unexplained shortness of breath, chest pain or fainting. A pulmonary embolism occurs when a clump of material, most often a blood clot, gets stuck in an artery in the lungs, blocking the flow of blood. Blood clots most commonly come from the deep veins of your legs, a condition known as deep vein thrombosis. In many cases, multiple clots are involved. The portions of lung served by each blocked artery can't get blood and may die. This is known as a pulmonary infarction. This makes it more difficult for your lungs to provide oxygen to the rest of your body. Occasionally, blockages in the blood vessels are caused by substances other than blood clots, such as: Although anyone can develop blood clots that result in a pulmonary embolism, certain factors can increase your risk. You're at a higher risk if you or any of your blood relatives, such as a parent or sibling, have had venous blood clots or a pulmonary embolism in the past. Some medical conditions and treatments put you at risk, such as: Blood clots are more likely to form during longer than usual periods of inactivity, such as: A pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening. About one-third of people with an undiagnosed and untreated pulmonary embolism don't survive. When the condition is diagnosed and treated promptly, however, that number drops dramatically. Pulmonary embolisms also can lead to pulmonary hypertension, a condition in which the blood pressure in the lungs and in the right side of the heart is too high. When you have blockages in the arteries inside your lungs, your heart must work harder to push blood through those vessels. This increases blood pressure and eventually weakens your heart. In rare cases, small clots called emboli remain in the lungs and scarring develops in the pulmonary arteries over time. This restricts blood flow and results in chronic pulmonary hypertension. Preventing clots in the deep veins in your legs will help prevent pulmonary embolisms. For this reason, most hospitals are aggressive about taking measures to prevent blood clots, including: The risk of blood clots developing while traveling is low but increases as long-haul travel increases. If you have risk factors for blood clots and you're concerned about travel, talk with your health care provider. Your provider might suggest the following to help prevent blood clots during travel: ","A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that blocks and stops blood flow to an artery in the lung. In most cases, the blood clot starts in a deep vein in the leg and travels to the lung. Rarely, the clot forms in a vein in another part of the body. When a blood clot forms in one or more of the deep veins in the body, it's called a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Because one or more clots block blood flow to the lungs, pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening. However, prompt treatment greatly reduces the risk of death.

Pulmonary fibrosis,"Symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis may include: How fast pulmonary fibrosis worsens over time and how severe the symptoms are can vary greatly from person to person. Some people become ill very quickly with severe disease. Others have moderate symptoms that worsen more slowly, over months or years. In people with pulmonary fibrosis, especially idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, shortness of breath can suddenly get worse over a few weeks or days. This is called an acute exacerbation. It can be life-threatening. The cause of an acute exacerbation may be another condition or an illness, such as a lung infection. But usually the cause is not known. If you have symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis, contact your doctor or other healthcare professional as soon as possible. If your symptoms get worse, especially if they get worse fast, contact your healthcare team right away. Pulmonary fibrosis is scarring and thickening of the tissue around and between the air sacs called alveoli in the lungs. These changes make it harder for oxygen to pass into the bloodstream. Damage to the lungs that results in pulmonary fibrosis may be caused by many different things. Examples include long-term exposure to certain toxins, radiation therapy, some medicines and certain medical conditions. In some cases, the cause of pulmonary fibrosis is not known. The type of work you do and where you work or live could be the cause or part of the cause for pulmonary fibrosis. Having continuous or repeated contact with toxins or pollutants — substances that harm the quality of water, air or land — can damage your lungs, especially if you do not wear protective gear. Examples include: Some people who receive radiation therapy to the chest, such as for lung or breast cancer, show signs of lung damage months or sometimes years after treatment. How severe the damage is may depend on: Many medicines can damage the lungs. Some examples include: Lung damage can also result from a number of conditions, including: Many substances and conditions can lead to pulmonary fibrosis. Even so, in many people, the cause is never found. But risk factors such as smoking or exposure to air pollution could be related to the condition, even if the cause cannot be confirmed. Pulmonary fibrosis with no known cause is called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Many people with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis also may have gastroesophageal reflux disease, also called GERD. This condition occurs when acid from the stomach flows back into the esophagus.GERDmay be a risk factor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or cause the condition to worsen faster. But more studies are needed. Pulmonary fibrosis has been found in children and infants, but this is not common. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is much more likely to affect middle-aged and older adults. Other types of pulmonary fibrosis, such as that caused by connective tissue disease, can occur in younger people. Factors that can raise your risk of pulmonary fibrosis include: Complications of pulmonary fibrosis may include: ","Pulmonary fibrosis is a lung disease that occurs when lung tissue becomes damaged and scarred.

Pulmonary hypertension,"The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension develop slowly. You may not notice them for months or even years. Symptoms get worse as the disease progresses. Pulmonary hypertension symptoms include: Shortness of breath is the most common symptom of pulmonary hypertension. But it may be caused by other health conditions such as asthma. See a health care professional for an accurate diagnosis. The typical heart has two upper chambers and two lower chambers. Each time blood moves through the heart, the lower right chamber pumps blood to the lungs. The blood passes through a large blood vessel called the pulmonary artery. Blood usually flows easily through blood vessels in the lungs to the left side of the heart. These blood vessels are the pulmonary arteries, capillaries and veins. But changes in the cells that line the lung arteries can cause the artery walls to become narrow, stiff, swollen and thick. These changes may slow down or stop blood flow through the lungs, causing pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is classified into five groups, depending on the cause. Causes include: This is the most common form of pulmonary hypertension. Causes include: Causes include: Causes include: Causes include: Eisenmenger syndrome is a type of congenital heart disease that causes pulmonary hypertension. It can occur with unrepaired holes between the heart chambers. An example is a large hole in the heart between the two lower heart chambers called a ventricular septal defect. The hole in the heart causes blood to flow incorrectly in the heart. Oxygen-rich blood mixes with oxygen-poor blood. The blood then returns to the lungs instead of going to the rest of the body. This increases the blood flow and pressure in the pulmonary arteries, causing pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is usually diagnosed in people ages 30 to 60.

Rabies,"The first symptoms of rabies may be very similar to those of the flu and may last for days.
Later signs and symptoms may include:
Seek immediate medical care if you're bitten by any animal, or exposed to an animal suspected of having rabies. Based on your injuries and the situation in which the exposure happened, you and your doctor can decide whether you should receive treatment to prevent rabies.
Even if you aren't sure whether you've been bitten, seek medical attention. For instance, a bat that flies into your room while you're sleeping may bite you without waking you. If you awake to find a bat in your room, assume you've been bitten. Also, if you find a bat near a person who can't report a bite, such as a small child or a person with a disability, assume that person has been bitten.","Rabies is a deadly virus spread to people from the saliva of infected animals. The rabies virus is usually transmitted through a bite.
Animals most likely to transmit rabies in the United States include bats, coyotes, foxes, raccoons and skunks. In developing countries, stray dogs are the most likely to spread rabies to people.
Once a person begins showing signs and symptoms of rabies, the disease nearly always causes death. For this reason, anyone who may have a risk of contracting rabies should receive rabies vaccinations for protection.
Jason Howland:The most dangerous threat of rabies in the U.S. is flying overhead.
Gregory Poland, M.D., Vaccine Research Group Mayo Clinic:""It used to be thought, well, it's a rabid dog. But the more common way of getting rabies is from the silver-haired bat.""
Jason Howland:The deadly virus is transmitted from the saliva of infected animals to humans, usually through a bite.
Dr. Poland:""… The bat doesn't always bite. Sometimes the saliva will drool onto you, and you could have a minor open cut. Or sometimes a bat will lick on the skin and, again, transmit the virus that way.""
Jason Howland:Dr. Poland says that's why if you wake up and find a bat in the room, you should get the rabies vaccine.
Dr. Poland:""People think, 'Well, the bat's in the house. We woke up with it, doesn't look like it bit anybody.' Doesn't matter. Rabies is such a severe disease with no cure, no treatment for it, that the safer thing to do is to give rabies vaccine.""
Jason Howland:That includes an immune globulin and multidose rabies series which is not cheap. A typical series of rabies vaccines cost anywhere from three to seven thousand dollars.
For the Mayo Clinic News Network, I'm Jason Howland."
Radiation sickness,"The severity of radiation sickness symptoms depends on how much radiation you've absorbed. How much you absorb depends on the strength of the radiated energy, the time of your exposures, and the distance between you and the source of radiation. Symptoms also are affected by the type of exposure, such as total or partial body. The severity of radiation sickness also depends on how sensitive the affected tissue is. For instance, the gastrointestinal system and bone marrow are highly sensitive to radiation. The first symptoms of treatable radiation sickness are usually nausea and vomiting. The amount of time between exposure and when these symptoms develop is a clue to how much radiation a person has absorbed. After the first round of symptoms, a person with radiation sickness may have a brief period with no noticeable illness, followed by the onset of new, more-serious symptoms. If you've had a mild exposure, it may take hours to weeks before symptoms begin. But with high exposure, symptoms can begin minutes to days after exposure. Possible symptoms include: An accident or attack that causes radiation sickness would lead to a lot of attention and public concern. If such an event happens, listen to radio, television or online reports to learn about emergency instructions for your area. If you know you've been overexposed to radiation, seek emergency medical care. Radiation sickness is caused by being exposed to a high dose of radiation. Radiation is the energy released from atoms as either a wave or a tiny particle of matter. Radiation sickness happens when high-energy radiation damages or destroys certain cells in the body. Areas of the body most at risk of being affected by high-energy radiation are the bone marrow cells and the lining of the intestinal tract. Being exposed to a source of high-dose radiation increases the risk of radiation sickness. Sources of high-dose radiation include: Having radiation sickness can contribute to both short-term and long-term mental health problems, such as grief, fear and anxiety about: In the event of a radiation emergency, listen to the radio or watch television to hear what protective actions local, state and federal authorities recommend. Those actions depend on the situation, but you will be told to either stay in place or evacuate your area. If you're advised to stay where you are, whether you're at home or work or elsewhere, do the following: If you're advised to evacuate, follow the instructions provided by your local authorities. Try to stay calm and move quickly and in an orderly manner. Travel lightly, but take supplies, including: Be aware that most emergency vehicles and shelters won't accept pets. Take them only if you're driving your own vehicle and going someplace other than a shelter. ","Radiation sickness is damage to the body caused by a large dose of radiation often received over a short time. This is called acute radiation sickness. The amount of radiation absorbed by the body, called the absorbed dose, determines how bad the illness will be. Radiation sickness also is called acute radiation syndrome or radiation poisoning. Radiation sickness is not caused by common medical imaging tests that use low-dose radiation, such as X-rays, CT scans and nuclear medicine scans. Although radiation sickness is serious and often fatal, it's rare. Since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, during World War II, most cases of radiation sickness have occurred after nuclear industrial accidents, such as the 1986 fire that damaged the nuclear power plant at Chernobyl, Ukraine. The severity of radiation sickness symptoms depends on how much radiation you've absorbed. How much you absorb depends on the strength of the radiated energy, the time of your exposures, and the distance between you and the source of radiation. Symptoms also are affected by the type of exposure, such as total or partial body. The severity of radiation sickness also depends on how sensitive the affected tissue is. For instance, the gastrointestinal system and bone marrow are highly sensitive to radiation. The first symptoms of treatable radiation sickness are usually nausea and vomiting. The amount of time between exposure and when these symptoms develop is a clue to how much radiation a person has absorbed. After the first round of symptoms, a person with radiation sickness may have a brief period with no noticeable illness, followed by the onset of new, more-serious symptoms. If you've had a mild exposure, it may take hours to weeks before symptoms begin. But with high exposure, symptoms can begin minutes to days after exposure. Possible symptoms include: An accident or attack that causes radiation sickness would lead to a lot of attention and public concern. If such an event happens, listen to radio, television or online reports to learn about emergency instructions for your area. If you know you've been overexposed to radiation, seek emergency medical care. Radiation sickness is caused by being exposed to a high dose of radiation. Radiation is the energy released from atoms as either a wave or a tiny particle of matter. Radiation sickness happens when high-energy radiation damages or destroys certain cells in the body. Areas of the body most at risk of being affected by high-energy radiation are the bone marrow cells and the lining of the intestinal tract. Being exposed to a source of high-dose radiation increases the risk of radiation sickness. Sources of high-dose radiation include: Having radiation sickness can contribute to both short-term and long-term mental health problems, such as grief, fear and anxiety about: In the event of a radiation emergency, listen to the radio or watch television to hear what protective actions local, state and federal authorities recommend. Those actions depend on the situation, but you will be told to either stay in place or evacuate your area. If you're advised to stay where you are, whether you're at home or work or elsewhere, do the following: If you're advised to evacuate, follow the instructions provided by your local authorities. Try to stay calm and move quickly and in an orderly manner. Travel lightly, but take supplies, including: Be aware that most emergency vehicles and shelters won't accept pets. Take them only if you're driving your own vehicle and going someplace other than a shelter. "
Rheumatic fever,"Rheumatic fever symptoms usually start about 2 to 4 weeks after a strep throat infection. Symptoms are due to swelling, called inflammation, in the heart, joints, skin or central nervous system. There may be few symptoms or several. Symptoms can come and go or change while a person is sick with rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever symptoms can include: Some people with rheumatic fever develop a condition called Sydenham chorea. Symptoms of this condition include: Properly treating strep throat can prevent rheumatic fever. Make an appointment with a healthcare professional if any of these symptoms of strep throat occur: Rheumatic fever can happen after a throat infection from group A streptococcus bacteria, also called strep bacteria. The bacteria cause strep throat and scarlet fever. Improperly treated strep throat or scarlet fever infections cause rheumatic fever. There's little chance of getting rheumatic fever when strep throat is treated right away with antibiotics. It's important to finish all of the medicine. Group A strep infections of the skin or other parts of the body rarely cause rheumatic fever. How a strep infection causes rheumatic fever isn't clear. It may be that the bacteria trick the body's immune system into attacking healthy tissue. This usually happens in the heart, joints, skin and central nervous system. The incorrect immune system reaction causes swelling of joints and tissues. This swelling is called inflammation. Things that may increase the risk of rheumatic fever include: Joint and tissue swelling caused by rheumatic fever can last a few weeks to several months. For some people, the swelling causes long-term complications. One complication of rheumatic fever is long-lasting heart damage. This is called rheumatic heart disease. Rheumatic heart disease usually occurs years to decades after the original illness. However, severe rheumatic fever can start to damage the heart valves while a child still has symptoms of the infection. The valve between the two left chambers of the heart is most commonly affected. This valve is called the mitral valve. But other heart valves also may be affected. Rheumatic fever can cause these types of heart damage: The best way to prevent rheumatic fever is to treat strep throat infections or scarlet fever right away. It's also important to finish all of the prescribed antibiotics as directed. ","Rheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that can develop when strep throat or scarlet fever isn't properly treated. Strep throat and scarlet fever are caused by an infection with streptococcus (strep-toe-KOK-us) bacteria. Rheumatic fever most often affects children ages 5 to 15. But younger children and adults can get it too. Rheumatic fever is rare in the United States and other developed countries. Rheumatic fever can cause long-lasting heart damage, including heart valve problems and heart failure. Treatment includes medicines to kill the strep bacteria. Other medicines are used to treat pain and prevent complications. Rheumatic fever symptoms usually start about 2 to 4 weeks after a strep throat infection.

SARSis a serious illness that can lead to death. If you have signs or symptoms of a respiratory infection, or if you have flu-like signs and symptoms with fever after traveling abroad, see your doctor right away.","Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a contagious and sometimes fatal respiratory illness. severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first appeared in China in November 2002. Within a few months,SARSspread worldwide, carried by unsuspecting travelers.
SARSshowed how quickly infection can spread in a highly mobile and interconnected world. On the other hand, a collaborative international effort allowed health experts to quickly contain the spread of the disease. There has been no known transmission ofSARSanywhere in the world since 2004."
Sepsis,"Symptoms of sepsis may include:
Symptoms of sepsis are not specific. They can vary from person to person, and sepsis may appear differently in children than in adults.
Sepsis may progress to septic shock. Septic shock is a severe drop in blood pressure. Progression to septic shock raises the risk of death. Symptoms of septic shock include:
Any infection could lead to sepsis. Go to a health care provider if you have symptoms of sepsis or an infection or wound that isn't getting better.
Symptoms such as confusion or fast breathing need emergency care.","Sepsis is a serious condition in which the body responds improperly to an infection. The infection-fighting processes turn on the body, causing the organs to work poorly.
Sepsis may progress to septic shock. This is a dramatic drop in blood pressure that can damage the lungs, kidneys, liver and other organs. When the damage is severe, it can lead to death.
Early treatment of sepsis improves chances for survival."
Shaken baby syndrome,"Shaken baby syndrome symptoms and signs include: While sometimes there's bruising on the face, you may not see signs of physical injury to the child's outer body. Injuries that might not be immediately seen include bleeding in the brain and eyes, spinal cord damage, and fractures of the ribs, skull, legs and other bones. Many children with shaken baby syndrome show signs and symptoms of prior child abuse. In mild cases of shaken baby syndrome, a child may appear normal after being shaken, but over time they may develop health or behavioral problems. Seek immediate help if you suspect your child has been injured by violent shaking. Call 911 or emergency medical help, or take your child to the nearest emergency room. Getting medical care right away may save your child's life or prevent serious health problems. Health care professionals are legally required to report all suspected cases of child abuse to state authorities. Babies have weak neck muscles and can't support the weight of their heads. If a baby is forcefully shaken, their fragile brain moves back and forth inside the skull. This causes bruising, swelling and bleeding. Shaken baby syndrome usually occurs when a parent or caregiver severely shakes a baby or toddler due to frustration or anger — often because the child won't stop crying. Shaken baby syndrome isn't usually caused by bouncing a child on your knee or minor falls. The following things may increase the risk that parents or caregivers are more likely to forcefully shake a baby and cause shaken baby syndrome: Also, men are more likely to cause shaken baby syndrome than are women. Even brief shaking of an infant can cause irreversible brain damage. Many children affected by shaken baby syndrome die. Survivors of shaken baby syndrome may require lifelong medical care for conditions such as: New parent education classes can help parents better understand the dangers of violent shaking and may provide tips to soothe a crying baby and manage stress. When your crying baby can't be calmed, you may be tempted to try anything to get the tears to stop — but it's important to always treat your child gently. Nothing justifies shaking a child. If you're having trouble managing your emotions or the stress of parenthood, seek help. Your child's doctor may offer a referral to a counselor or other mental health provider. If other people help take care of your child — whether a hired caregiver, sibling or grandparent — make sure they know the dangers of shaken baby syndrome. ","Shaken baby syndrome is a serious brain injury resulting from forcefully shaking an infant or toddler. It's also known as abusive head trauma, shaken impact syndrome, inflicted head injury or whiplash shaken infant syndrome. Shaken baby syndrome destroys a child's brain cells and prevents his or her brain from getting enough oxygen. This form of child abuse can cause permanent brain damage or death. Shaken baby syndrome is preventable. Help is available for parents who are at risk of harming a child. Parents also can educate other caregivers about the dangers of shaken baby syndrome.

Soft tissue sarcoma,"A soft tissue sarcoma may not cause any symptoms at first. As the cancer grows, it may cause: Make an appointment with your health care team if you have any symptoms that worry you. It's not clear what causes most soft tissue sarcomas. Soft tissue sarcoma starts when a connective tissue cell gets changes in its DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The changes turn the connective tissue cells into cancer cells. The changes tell the cancer cells to grow and make more cells. Healthy cells die as part of their natural cycle, but cancer cells keep growing because they do not have instructions to stop. The cancer cells form a growth, called a tumor. In some types of soft tissue sarcoma, the cancer cells stay in one location. They continue making more cells and cause the tumor to get bigger. In other types of soft tissue sarcoma, the cancer cells might break away and spread to other parts of the body. The type of cell with DNA changes is what determines the type of soft tissue sarcoma. For example, angiosarcoma begins in cells in the lining of blood vessels, while liposarcoma starts in fat cells. Some types of soft tissue sarcoma include: Factors that may raise the risk of sarcoma include: ","Soft tissue sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that starts as a growth of cells in the body's soft tissues. The soft tissues connect, support and surround other body structures. Soft tissues include muscle, fat, blood vessels, nerves, tendons and linings of the joints. Soft tissue sarcoma can happen anywhere in the body. It happens most often in the arms, legs and belly. More than 50 types of soft tissue sarcoma exist. Some types are more likely to affect children. Others affect mostly adults. These cancers can be hard to diagnose because they may be mistaken for many other types of growths. Soft tissue sarcoma treatment usually involves surgery. Other treatments might include radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Treatment depends on the size, type and location of the cancer and how quickly it grows.

Spinal cord injury,"The ability to control your arms or legs after a spinal cord injury depends on two factors. One factor is where the injury occurred on the spinal cord. The other factor is how bad the injury is. The lowest part of the spinal cord not damaged after an injury is known as the neurological level of the injury. ""The completeness"" of the injury refers to how much feeling, known as sensation, is lost. Completeness is classified as: Loss of feeling and control of movement is known as paralysis. Paralysis from a spinal cord injury can be referred to as: Your healthcare team performs a series of tests to determine the neurological level and completeness of your injury. Spinal cord injuries can cause the following symptoms: Emergency symptoms of a spinal cord injury after an accident include: Anyone who has an injury to the head or neck needs an immediate medical evaluation. It is safest to assume that the person has a spinal injury until proved otherwise. This is important because: Spinal cord injuries can result from damage to the spinal cord itself or to the bones that surround the spinal cord, known as the vertebrae. Injuries also may happen as a result of damage to the ligaments or disks of the spinal column. A sudden, traumatic blow to the spine can fracture, dislocate, crush or compress one or more of the vertebrae. A gunshot or knife wound that penetrates and cuts the spinal cord also can cause a spinal cord injury. Additional damage usually occurs over days or weeks. This is because of bleeding, swelling and fluid accumulation in and around the spinal cord after an injury. Other causes of a spinal cord injury don't include trauma. Arthritis, cancer, inflammation, infections or disk degeneration of the spine can be possible causes. The central nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord. The spinal cord is made of soft tissue and is surrounded by bones called vertebrae. It extends down from the base of the brain and contains nerve cells and groups of nerves called tracts. The tracts go to different parts of your body. The lower end of your spinal cord stops a little above your waist in the region called the conus medullaris. Below this region is a group of nerve roots called the cauda equina. Tracts in your spinal cord carry messages between your brain and the rest of your body. Motor tracts carry signals from your brain to control muscle movement. Sensory tracts carry signals from body parts to your brain relating to heat, cold, pressure, pain, and the position of your arms and legs. Whether the cause is traumatic or nontraumatic, spinal cord damage affects the nerve fibers passing through the injured area. This can impair part of or all the muscles and nerves below the injury site. An injury to the chest or lower back can affect the trunk, legs, bowel, bladder and sexual function. A neck injury affects the same areas plus movements of the arms and possibly the ability to breathe. The most common causes of spinal cord injuries in the United States are: A spinal cord injury usually results from an accident and can happen to anyone. But certain factors can increase the risk of having a spinal cord injury, including: A spinal cord injury can lead to many complications.

Stomach cancer,"Signs and symptoms of stomach cancer may include: Stomach cancer doesn't always cause symptoms in its early stages. When they happen, symptoms might include indigestion and pain in the upper part of the belly. Symptoms might not happen until the cancer is advanced. Later stages of stomach cancer might cause symptoms such as feeling very tired, losing weight without trying, vomiting blood and having black stools. Stomach cancer that spreads to other parts of the body is called metastatic stomach cancer. It causes symptoms specific to where it spreads. For example, when cancer spreads to the lymph nodes it might cause lumps you can feel through the skin. Cancer that spreads to the liver might cause yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes. If cancer spreads within the belly, it might cause fluid to fill the belly. The belly might look swollen. If you have signs and symptoms that worry you, make an appointment with your health care provider. Many conditions can cause symptoms that are like the ones caused by stomach cancer. Your provider might test for those other causes first before testing for stomach cancer. It's not clear what causes stomach cancer. Experts believe most stomach cancers start when something hurts the inside lining of the stomach. Examples include having an infection in the stomach, having long-standing acid reflux and eating a lot of salty foods. Not everyone with these risk factors gets stomach cancer, though. So more research is needed to find out exactly what causes it. Stomach cancer begins when something hurts cells in the inner lining of the stomach. It causes the cells to develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA holds the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The changes tell the cells to multiply quickly. The cells can go on living when healthy cells would die as part of their natural lifecycle. This causes a lot of extra cells in the stomach. The cells can form a mass called a tumor. Cancer cells in the stomach can invade and destroy healthy body tissue. They might start to grow deeper into the wall of the stomach. In time, cancer cells can break away and spread to other parts of the body. When cancer cells spread to another part of the body it's called metastasis. The type of stomach cancer you have is based on the type of cell where your cancer began. Examples of stomach cancer types include: Factors that increase the risk of stomach cancer include: To lower the risk of stomach cancer, you can: ","Stomach cancer, which is also called gastric cancer, is a growth of cells that starts in the stomach. The stomach is in the upper middle part of the belly, just below the ribs. The stomach helps to break down and digest food. Stomach cancer can happen in any part of the stomach. In most of the world, stomach cancers happen in the main part of the stomach. This part is called the stomach body. In the United States, stomach cancer is more likely to start by the gastroesophageal junction. This is the part where the long tube that carries food you swallow meets the stomach. The tube that carries food to the stomach is called the esophagus. Where the cancer starts in the stomach is one factor health care providers think about when making a treatment plan. Other factors might include the cancer's stage and the type of cells involved. Treatment often includes surgery to remove the stomach cancer. Other treatments may be used before and after surgery. Stomach cancer treatment is most likely to be successful if the cancer is only in the stomach. The prognosis for people with small stomach cancers is quite good. Many can expect to be cured. Most stomach cancers are found when the disease is advanced and a cure is less likely. Stomach cancer that grows through the stomach wall or spreads to other parts of the body is harder to cure. Signs and symptoms of stomach cancer may include: Stomach cancer doesn't always cause symptoms in its early stages.

Sunburn,"Sunburn symptoms can include: Any exposed part of the body — including the earlobes, scalp and lips — can burn. Even covered areas can burn if, for example, clothing has a loose weave that allows ultraviolet (UV) light through. The eyes, which are extremely sensitive to the sun's UV light, also can burn. Sunburn symptoms often appear within a few hours after sun exposure. Within a few days, the body may start to heal itself by peeling the damaged skin's top layer. A bad sunburn may take several days to heal. Any lingering changes in skin color usually go away with time. See your health care provider if you: Seek immediate medical care if you are sunburned and experience: Sunburn is caused by too much exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light may be from the sun or artificial sources, such as sunlamps and tanning beds. UVA is the wavelength of light that can penetrate to the deep layers of skin and lead to skin damage over time. UVB is the wavelength of light that penetrates the skin more superficially and causes sunburn. The UV light damages skin cells. The immune system reacts by increasing blood flow to the affected areas, which causes the inflamed skin (erythema) known as sunburn. You can get sunburn on cool or cloudy days. Surfaces such as snow, sand and water can reflect UV rays and burn skin too. Risk factors for sunburn include: Intense, repeated sun exposure that results in sunburn increases your risk of other skin damage and certain diseases. These include premature aging of skin (photoaging), precancerous skin lesions and skin cancer. Sun exposure and repeated sunburns speed the skin's aging process. Skin changes caused by UV light are called photoaging. The results of photoaging include: Precancerous skin lesions are rough, scaly patches in areas that have been damaged by the sun. They're often found on the sun-exposed areas of the head, face, neck and hands of people whose skin burns easily in the sun. These patches can evolve into skin cancer. They're also called actinic keratoses (ak-TIN-ik ker-uh-TOE-seez) and solar keratoses. Excessive sun exposure, even without sunburn, increases your risk of skin cancer, such as melanoma. It can damage the DNA of skin cells. Sunburns in childhood and adolescence may increase the risk of melanoma later in life. Skin cancer develops mainly on areas of the body most exposed to sunlight, including the scalp, face, lips, ears, neck, chest, arms, hands, legs and back. Some types of skin cancer appear as a small growth or a sore that bleeds easily, crusts over, heals and then reopens. With melanoma, an existing mole may change, or a new, suspicious-looking mole may grow. See your health care provider if you notice: Too much UV light damages the cornea. Sun damage to the lens can lead to clouding of the lens (cataracts). Sunburned eyes may feel painful or gritty. Sunburn of the cornea is also called snow blindness. This type of damage might be caused by the sun, welding, tanning lamps and broken mercury vapor lamps. Use these methods to prevent sunburn, even on cool, cloudy or hazy days. Sun exposure on cloudy days is decreased by about 20%. Be extra careful around water, snow, concrete and sand because they reflect the sun's rays. In addition, UV light is more intense at high altitudes. ","Sunburn is inflamed, painful skin that feels hot to the touch. It often appears within a few hours of being in the sun too long. You can get sunburn relief with simple self-care measures such as taking pain relievers and cooling the skin. But it may take days for the sunburn to fade. Preventing sunburn year-round by wearing sunscreen or using other skin-protection habits is important for everyone. It is especially important when you're outdoors, even on cool or cloudy days. Sunburn symptoms can include: Any exposed part of the body — including the earlobes, scalp and lips — can burn. Even covered areas can burn if, for example, clothing has a loose weave that allows ultraviolet (UV) light through. The eyes, which are extremely sensitive to the sun's UV light, also can burn. Sunburn symptoms often appear within a few hours after sun exposure. Within a few days, the body may start to heal itself by peeling the damaged skin's top layer. A bad sunburn may take several days to heal. Any lingering changes in skin color usually go away with time. See your health care provider if you: Seek immediate medical care if you are sunburned and experience: Sunburn is caused by too much exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light may be from the sun or artificial sources, such as sunlamps and tanning beds. UVA is the wavelength of light that can penetrate to the deep layers of skin and lead to skin damage over time. UVB is the wavelength of light that penetrates the skin more superficially and causes sunburn. The UV light damages skin cells. The immune system reacts by increasing blood flow to the affected areas, which causes the inflamed skin (erythema) known as sunburn. You can get sunburn on cool or cloudy days. Surfaces such as snow, sand and water can reflect UV rays and burn skin too.

Syphilis,"Syphilis develops in stages. The symptoms vary with each stage. But the stages may overlap. And the symptoms don't always happen in the same order. You may be infected with syphilis bacteria without noticing any symptoms for years. The first symptom of syphilis is a small sore called a chancre (SHANG-kur). The sore is often painless. It appears at the spot where the bacteria entered your body. Most people with syphilis develop only one chancre. Some people get more than one. The chancre often forms about three weeks after you come in contact with syphilis bacteria. Many people who have syphilis don't notice the chancre. That's because it's usually painless. It also may be hidden within the vagina or rectum. The chancre heals on its own within 3 to 6 weeks. You may get a rash while the first chancre heals or a few weeks after it heals. A rash caused by syphilis: The rash often starts on the trunk of the body. That includes the chest, stomach area, pelvis and back. In time, it also could appear on the limbs, the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Along with the rash, you may have symptoms such as: Symptoms of secondary syphilis may go away on their own. But without treatment, they could come and go for months or years. If you aren't treated for syphilis, the disease moves from the secondary stage to the latent stage. This also is called the hidden stage because you have no symptoms. The latent stage can last for years. Your symptoms may never come back. But without treatment, the disease might lead to major health problems, also called complications. After the latent stage, up to 30% to 40% of people with syphilis who don't get treatment have complications known as tertiary syphilis. Another name for it is late syphilis. The disease may damage the: These problems may happen many years after the original, untreated infection. At any stage, untreated syphilis can affect the brain, spinal cord, eyes and other body parts. This can cause serious or life-threatening health problems. Pregnant people who have syphilis can pass the disease to their babies. Unborn babies can become infected through the organ that provides nutrients and oxygen in the womb, called the placenta. Infection also can happen during birth. Newborns with congenital syphilis might have no symptoms. But without fast treatment, some babies might get: Later symptoms may include deafness, teeth problems and saddle nose, a condition in which the bridge of the nose collapses. Babies with syphilis also can be born too early. They may die in the womb before birth. Or they could die after birth. Call a member of your health care team if you or your child has any symptoms of syphilis. These could include any unusual discharge, a sore or a rash, especially in the groin area. Also get tested for syphilis if you: The cause of syphilis is a bacterium called Treponema pallidum. The most common way syphilis spreads is through contact with an infected person's sore during vaginal, oral or anal sex. The bacteria enter the body through minor cuts or scrapes in the skin or in the moist inner lining of some body parts. Syphilis is contagious during its primary and secondary stages. Sometimes it's also contagious in the early latent period, which happens within a year of getting infected. Less often, syphilis can spread by kissing or touching an active sore on the lips, tongue, mouth, breasts or genitals. It also can be passed to babies during pregnancy and childbirth and sometimes through breastfeeding. Syphilis can't be spread through casual contact with objects that an infected person has touched. So you can't catch it by using the same toilet, bathtub, clothing, eating utensils, doorknobs, swimming pools or hot tubs. Once cured, syphilis doesn't come back on its own. But you can become infected again if you have contact with someone's syphilis sore. The risk of catching syphilis is higher if you: The chances of getting syphilis also are higher for men who have sex with men. The higher risk may be linked, in part, with less access to health care and less use of condoms among this group. Another risk factor for some people in this group includes recent sex with partners found through social media apps. Without treatment, syphilis can lead to damage throughout the body. Syphilis also raises the risk of HIV infection and can cause problems during pregnancy. Treatment can help prevent damage. But it can't repair or reverse damage that's already happened. Rarely in the late stage of syphilis, bumps called gummas can form on the skin, bones, liver or any other organ. Most often, gummas go away after treatment with medicine called antibiotics. Syphilis can cause many problems with the brain, its covering or the spinal cord. These issues include: Disease that spreads to the eye is called ocular syphilis. It can cause: Disease that spreads to the ear is called otosyphilis. Symptoms can include: These may include bulging and swelling of the aorta — the body's major artery — and other blood vessels. Syphilis also may damage heart valves. Syphilis sores on the genitals raise the risk of catching or spreading HIV through sex. A syphilis sore can bleed easily. This provides an easy way for HIV to enter the bloodstream during sex. If you're pregnant, you could pass syphilis to your unborn baby. Congenital syphilis greatly raises the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth or your newborn's death within a few days after birth. There is no vaccine for syphilis. To help prevent the spread of syphilis, follow these tips: A medicine called doxycycline may be an option to prevent infection among people who have a higher risk than average of getting syphilis. Higher risk groups include men who have sex with men and transgender women. Taking doxycycline within 3 days of sexual activity lowers the risk of an infection with the bacteria that cause syphilis. Your healthcare professional can prescribe doxycycline and any testing you need while taking the medicine. If tests show that you have syphilis, your sex partners need to know so that they can get tested. This includes your current partners and any others you've had over the last three months to 1 year. If they're infected, they can then get treatment. After you learn you have syphilis, your local health department may contact you. A department employee talks with you about private ways to let your partners know that they've been exposed to syphilis. You can ask the department to do this for you without revealing your identity to your partners. Or you can contact your partners along with a department employee or simply tell your partners yourself. This free service is called partner notification. It can help limit the spread of syphilis. The practice also steers those at risk toward counseling and the right treatment. And since you can get syphilis more than once, partner notification lowers your risk of getting infected again. You can be infected with syphilis and not know it. And the disease can have deadly effects on unborn babies. For this reason, health officials recommend that all pregnant people be tested for the disease. ","Syphilis is an infection caused by bacteria. Most often, it spreads through sexual contact. The disease starts as a sore that's often painless and typically appears on the genitals, rectum or mouth. Syphilis spreads from person to person through direct contact with these sores. It also can be passed to a baby during pregnancy and childbirth and sometimes through breastfeeding. After the infection happens, syphilis bacteria can stay in the body for many years without causing symptoms. But the infection can become active again. Without treatment, syphilis can damage the heart, brain or other organs. It can become life-threatening. Early syphilis can be cured, sometimes with a single shot of medicine called penicillin. That's why it's key to get a health care checkup as soon as you notice any symptoms of syphilis. All pregnant people should get tested for syphilis at their first prenatal checkup too.

Tetanus,"The average time from infection to appearance of signs and symptoms (incubation period) is 10 days. The incubation period can range from 3 to 21 days. The most common type of tetanus is called generalized tetanus. Signs and symptoms begin gradually and then progressively worsen over two weeks. They usually start at the jaw and progress downward on the body. Signs and symptoms of generalized tetanus include: Progression of tetanus results in repeated painful, seizure-like spasms that last for several minutes (generalized spasms). Usually, the neck and back arch, the legs become rigid, the arms are drawn up to the body, and the fists are clenched. Muscle rigidity in the neck and abdomen may cause breathing difficulties. These severe spasms may be triggered by minor events that stimulate the senses — a loud sound, a physical touch, a draft or light. As the disease progresses, other signs and symptoms may include: This uncommon form of tetanus results in muscles spasms near the site of a wound. While it's usually a less severe form of disease, it can progress to generalized tetanus. This rare form of tetanus results from a head wound. It results in weakened muscles in the face and spasms of the jaw muscles. It also can progress to generalized tetanus. Tetanus is a life-threatening disease. If you have signs or symptoms of tetanus, seek emergency care. If you have a simple, clean wound — and you've had a tetanus shot within 10 years — you can care for your wound at home. Seek medical care in the following cases: The bacterium that causes tetanus is called Clostridium tetani. The bacterium can survive in a dormant state in soil and animal feces. It's essentially shut down until it discovers a place to thrive. When the dormant bacteria enter a wound — a condition good for growth — the cells are ""awakened."" As they are growing and dividing, they release a toxin called tetanospasmin. The toxin impairs the nerves in the body that control muscles. The greatest risk factor for tetanus infection is not being vaccinated or not keeping up with the 10-year booster shots. Other factors that increase the risk of tetanus infection are: Complications of tetanus infection may include: You can prevent tetanus by being vaccinated. The tetanus vaccine is given to children as part of the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP). Diphtheria is a serious bacterial infection of the nose and throat. Acellular pertussis, also called whooping cough, is a highly contagious respiratory infection. Children who do not tolerate the pertussis vaccine may receive the alternative vaccine called DT. TheDTaPis a series of five shots typically given in the arm or thigh to children at ages: A booster shot is recommended for children at age 11 or 12. This booster is called the Tdap vaccine. If your child didn't get a booster shot as this age, talk to your doctor about appropriate options. A booster shot is recommended for adults once every 10 years. This may be one of two vaccines, Tdap or Td. If you weren't vaccinated against tetanus as a child or are unsure about your vaccination status, see your doctor about getting the Tdap vaccine. A booster is recommended during the third trimester of a pregnancy, regardless of the mother's vaccination schedule. ","Tetanus is a serious disease of the nervous system caused by a toxin-producing bacterium. The disease causes muscle contractions, particularly of your jaw and neck muscles. Tetanus is commonly known as lockjaw. Severe complications of tetanus can be life-threatening. There's no cure for tetanus. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and complications until the effects of the tetanus toxin resolve. Because of the widespread use of vaccines, cases of tetanus are rare in the United States and other parts of the developed world. The disease remains a threat to people who aren't up to date on their vaccinations. It's more common in developing countries. The average time from infection to appearance of signs and symptoms (incubation period) is 10 days. The incubation period can range from 3 to 21 days.

Tetralogy of Fallot,"Tetralogy of Fallot symptoms depend on how much blood flow is blocked from leaving the heart to go to the lungs. Symptoms may include: Some babies with tetralogy of Fallot suddenly develop deep blue or gray skin, nails, and lips. This usually happens when the baby cries, eats or is upset. These episodes are called tet spells. Tet spells are caused by a rapid drop in the amount of oxygen in the blood. They are most common in young infants, around 2 to 4 months old. Tet spells may be less noticeable in toddlers and older children. That's because they typically squat when they're short of breath. Squatting sends more blood to the lungs. Serious congenital heart defects are often diagnosed before or soon after your child is born. Seek medical help if you notice that your baby has these symptoms: If your baby becomes blue or gray, place your baby on the side and pull the baby's knees up to the chest. This helps increase blood flow to the lungs. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Tetralogy of Fallot occurs as the baby's heart grows during pregnancy. Usually, the cause is unknown. Tetralogy of Fallot includes four problems with heart structure: Some people with tetralogy of Fallot have other problems that affect the aorta or heart arteries. There also may be a hole between the heart's upper chambers, called atrial septal defect. The exact cause of tetralogy of Fallot is unknown. Some things may increase the risk of a baby being born with tetralogy of Fallot. Risk factors include: Untreated tetralogy of Fallot usually leads to life-threatening complications. The complications may cause disability or death by early adulthood. A possible complication of tetralogy of Fallot is infection of the inner lining of the heart or heart valves. This is called infective endocarditis. Sometimes antibiotics are given before dental work to prevent this type of infection. Ask your healthcare team if preventive antibiotics are right for you or your baby. Complications also are possible after surgery to repair tetralogy of Fallot. But most people do well after such surgery. When complications occur, they may include: Another procedure or surgery may be needed to fix these complications. People born with a complex congenital heart defect may be at risk for complications during pregnancy. Talk to your healthcare team about the possible risks and complications of pregnancy. Together you can discuss and plan for any special care needed. Because the exact cause of most congenital heart defects is unknown, it may not be possible to prevent these conditions. If you have a high risk of giving birth to a child with a congenital heart defect, genetic testing and screening may be done during pregnancy. There are some steps you can take to help reduce your child's overall risk of birth defects, such as: ","Tetralogy of Fallot (teh-TRAL-uh-jee of fuh-LOW) is a rare heart condition that is present at birth. That means it's a congenital heart defect. A baby born with the condition has four different heart problems. These heart problems affect the structure of the heart. The condition causes altered blood flow through the heart and to the rest of the body. Babies with tetralogy of Fallot often have blue or gray skin color due to low oxygen levels. Tetralogy of Fallot is usually diagnosed during pregnancy or soon after a baby is born. If the heart changes and symptoms are mild, tetralogy of Fallot may not be noticed or diagnosed until adulthood. People who are diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot need surgery to fix the heart. They will need regular health checkups for life. Tetralogy of Fallot symptoms depend on how much blood flow is blocked from leaving the heart to go to the lungs.

Thoracic aortic aneurysm,"Thoracic aortic aneurysms often grow slowly. There are usually no symptoms, making them difficult to detect. Many start small and stay small. Others grow bigger over time. How quickly a thoracic aortic aneurysm may grow is difficult to predict. As a thoracic aortic aneurysm grows, symptoms may include: Symptoms that a thoracic aortic aneurysm has ruptured or dissected include: Some aneurysms may never rupture or lead to dissection. Most people with aortic aneurysms don't have symptoms unless a dissection or rupture occurs. An aortic dissection or aneurysm rupture is a medical emergency. Call 911 or your local emergency number for immediate help. Aortic aneurysms can develop anywhere in the body's main artery, called the aorta. The aorta runs from the heart through the chest and belly area. When an aneurysm occurs in the chest, it's called a thoracic aortic aneurysm. If an aneurysm forms between the upper and lower parts of the aorta, it's called a thoracoabdominal aneurysm. A thoracic aneurysm may be round or tube-shaped. Aneurysms can occur anywhere in the thoracic aorta, including near the heart, in the aortic arch and in the lower part of the thoracic aorta. Causes of thoracic aortic aneurysms may include: In aortic dissection, a tear occurs in the wall of the aorta. This causes bleeding into and along the aortic wall. Sometimes the bleeding moves completely outside the aorta. When this happens, it's called an aortic rupture. An aortic dissection is a potentially life-threatening emergency, depending on where in the aorta it occurs. It's important to treat an aortic aneurysm to try to prevent dissection. If dissection occurs, people can still be treated with surgery. However, they typically have a higher risk of complications. Thoracic aortic aneurysm risk factors include: Tears in the wall of the aorta and rupture of the aorta are the main complications of thoracic aortic aneurysm. However, some small and slow-growing aneurysms may never rupture. In general, the larger the aneurysm, the greater the risk of rupture. Complications of a thoracic aortic aneurysm and rupture can include: Keeping the blood vessels as healthy as possible is important in preventing an aneurysm. A health care provider may recommend these heart-healthy strategies: There are no medicines to prevent an aortic aneurysm. However, medicines may be used to treat high blood pressure, high cholesterol and other conditions linked to aneurysm. Proper management of such conditions may lower the risk of thoracic aortic aneurysm complications. Conditions that cause a thoracic aortic aneurysm may run in families. A health care provider may recommend screening if a first-degree relative — such as a parent, brother, sister, son or daughter — has a genetic disease such as Marfan syndrome or another condition linked to thoracic aortic aneurysms. Screening means you have regular imaging tests, usually an echocardiogram, to check for an aneurysm. If an ultrasound of the heart shows an enlarged aorta or an aneurysm, another imaging test is usually done within 6 to 12 months to make sure it hasn't grown. Genetic testing also may be recommended if you have a family history of aortic aneurysms, particularly if you're considering pregnancy. ","A thoracic aortic aneurysm is a weakened area in the body's main artery in the chest. The body's main artery is called the aorta. When the aortic wall is weak, the artery may widen. When the vessel is significantly widened, it's called an aneurysm. A thoracic aortic aneurysm also is called a thoracic aneurysm. Treatment of a thoracic aortic aneurysm may vary from regular health checkups to emergency surgery. The type of treatment depends on the cause, size and growth rate of the thoracic aortic aneurysm. Complications of a thoracic aortic aneurysm include rupture of the aorta or a life-threatening tear between the layers of the aorta's wall. The tear is called an aortic dissection. Rupture or dissection can lead to sudden death. Thoracic aortic aneurysms are less common than aneurysms that form in the lower part of the aorta, called abdominal aortic aneurysms. Thoracic aortic aneurysms often grow slowly. There are usually no symptoms, making them difficult to detect. Many start small and stay small. Others grow bigger over time. How quickly a thoracic aortic aneurysm may grow is difficult to predict. As a thoracic aortic aneurysm grows, symptoms may include: Symptoms that a thoracic aortic aneurysm has ruptured or dissected include: Some aneurysms may never rupture or lead to dissection. Most people with aortic aneurysms don't have symptoms unless a dissection or rupture occurs. An aortic dissection or aneurysm rupture is a medical emergency. Call 911 or your local emergency number for immediate help. Aortic aneurysms can develop anywhere in the body's main artery, called the aorta. The aorta runs from the heart through the chest and belly area. When an aneurysm occurs in the chest, it's called a thoracic aortic aneurysm. If an aneurysm forms between the upper and lower parts of the aorta, it's called a thoracoabdominal aneurysm. A thoracic aneurysm may be round or tube-shaped. Aneurysms can occur anywhere in the thoracic aorta, including near the heart, in the aortic arch and in the lower part of the thoracic aorta. Causes of thoracic aortic aneurysms may include: In aortic dissection, a tear occurs in the wall of the aorta. This causes bleeding into and along the aortic wall. Sometimes the bleeding moves completely outside the aorta. When this happens, it's called an aortic rupture. An aortic dissection is a potentially life-threatening emergency, depending on where in the aorta it occurs. It's important to treat an aortic aneurysm to try to prevent dissection. If dissection occurs, people can still be treated with surgery. However, they typically have a higher risk of complications. Thoracic aortic aneurysm risk factors include: Tears in the wall of the aorta and rupture of the aorta are the main complications of thoracic aortic aneurysm. However, some small and slow-growing aneurysms may never rupture. In general, the larger the aneurysm, the greater the risk of rupture. Complications of a thoracic aortic aneurysm and rupture can include: Keeping the blood vessels as healthy as possible is important in preventing an aneurysm. A health care provider may recommend these heart-healthy strategies: There are no medicines to prevent an aortic aneurysm. However, medicines may be used to treat high blood pressure, high cholesterol and other conditions linked to aneurysm. Proper management of such conditions may lower the risk of thoracic aortic aneurysm complications. Conditions that cause a thoracic aortic aneurysm may run in families. A health care provider may recommend screening if a first-degree relative — such as a parent, brother, sister, son or daughter — has a genetic disease such as Marfan syndrome or another condition linked to thoracic aortic aneurysms.

Thyroid cancer,"Most thyroid cancers don't cause any signs or symptoms early in the disease. As thyroid cancer grows, it may cause: If you experience any signs or symptoms that worry you, make an appointment with your health care provider. Thyroid cancer happens when cells in the thyroid develop changes in their DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell the cell what to do. The changes, which doctors call mutations, tell the cells to grow and multiply rapidly. The cells go on living when healthy cells would naturally die. The accumulating cells form a mass called a tumor. The tumor can grow to invade nearby tissue and can spread (metastasize) to the lymph nodes in the neck. Sometimes the cancer cells can spread beyond the neck to the lungs, bones and other parts of the body. For most thyroid cancers, it's not clear what causes the DNA changes that cause the cancer. Thyroid cancer is classified into types based on the kinds of cells found in the tumor. Your type is determined when a sample of tissue from your cancer is examined under a microscope. The type of thyroid cancer is considered in determining your treatment and prognosis. Types of thyroid cancer include: Factors that may increase the risk of thyroid cancer include: Thyroid cancer can return despite successful treatment, and it can even come back if you've had your thyroid removed. This could happen if cancer cells spread beyond the thyroid before it's removed. Most thyroid cancers aren't likely to recur, including the most common types of thyroid cancer — papillary thyroid cancer and follicular thyroid cancer. Your health care provider can tell you if your cancer has an increased risk of recurring based on the particulars of your cancer. Recurrence is more likely if your cancer is aggressive or if it grows beyond your thyroid. When thyroid cancer recurrence happens, it's usually found in the first five years after your initial diagnosis. Thyroid cancer that comes back still has a good prognosis. It's often treatable, and most people will have successful treatment. Thyroid cancer may recur in: Your health care provider may recommend periodic blood tests or thyroid scans to check for signs that your cancer has returned. At these appointments, your provider may ask if you've experienced any signs and symptoms of thyroid cancer recurrence, such as: Thyroid cancer sometimes spreads to nearby lymph nodes or to other parts of the body. The cancer cells that spread might be found when you're first diagnosed or they might be found after treatment. The great majority of thyroid cancers don't ever spread. When thyroid cancer spreads, it most often travels to: Thyroid cancer that spreads might be detected on imaging tests, such as CT and MRI, when you're first diagnosed with thyroid cancer. After successful treatment, your health care provider might recommend follow-up appointments to look for signs that your thyroid cancer has spread. These appointments might include nuclear imaging scans that use a radioactive form of iodine and a special camera to detect thyroid cancer cells. Doctors aren't sure what causes the gene changes that lead to most thyroid cancers, so there's no way to prevent thyroid cancer in people who have an average risk of the disease. Adults and children with an inherited gene that increases the risk of medullary thyroid cancer may consider thyroid surgery to prevent cancer (prophylactic thyroidectomy). Discuss your options with a genetic counselor who can explain your risk of thyroid cancer and your treatment options. A medication that blocks the effects of radiation on the thyroid is sometimes provided to people living near nuclear power plants in the United States. The medication (potassium iodide) could be used in the unlikely event of a nuclear reactor accident. If you live within 10 miles of a nuclear power plant and are concerned about safety precautions, contact your state or local emergency management department for more information. ","Thyroid cancer is a growth of cells that starts in the thyroid. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck, just below the Adam's apple. The thyroid produces hormones that regulate heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and weight. Thyroid cancer might not cause any symptoms at first. But as it grows, it can cause signs and symptoms, such as swelling in your neck, voice changes and difficulty swallowing. Several types of thyroid cancer exist. Most types grow slowly, though some types can be very aggressive. Most thyroid cancers can be cured with treatment. Thyroid cancer rates seem to be increasing. The increase may be caused by improved imaging technology that allows health care providers to find small thyroid cancers on CT and MRI scans done for other conditions (incidental thyroid cancers). Thyroid cancers found in this way are usually small cancers that respond well to treatments. Most thyroid cancers don't cause any signs or symptoms early in the disease.

Toxic shock syndrome,"Possible signs and symptoms of toxic shock syndrome include:
Call your doctor immediately if you have signs or symptoms of toxic shock syndrome. This is especially important if you've recently used tampons or if you have a skin or wound infection.","Toxic shock syndrome is a rare, life-threatening complication of certain types of bacterial infections. Often toxic shock syndrome results from toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus (staph) bacteria, but the condition may also be caused by toxins produced by group A streptococcus (strep) bacteria.
Toxic shock syndrome can affect anyone, including men, children and postmenopausal women. Risk factors for toxic shock syndrome include skin wounds, surgery, and the use of tampons and other devices, such as menstrual cups, contraceptive sponges or diaphragms."
Transient ischemic attack (TIA),"Transient ischemic attacks usually last a few minutes. Most symptoms disappear within an hour. Rarely, symptoms may last up to 24 hours. The symptoms of aTIAare similar to those found early in a stroke. Symptoms happen suddenly and may include: You may have more than oneTIA. Their symptoms may be similar or different depending on which area of the brain is involved. If you think you're having or have had a transient ischemic attack, get medical attention right away.TIAsmost often occur hours or days before a stroke. Being evaluated quickly means healthcare professionals can pinpoint potential treatable conditions. Treating those conditions may help you prevent a stroke. The cause of a transient ischemic attack is similar to the cause of an ischemic stroke, which is the most common type of stroke. In an ischemic stroke, a blood clot blocks the blood supply to part of the brain. In aTIA, unlike a stroke, the blockage is brief and there is no permanent damage. The blockage that occurs during aTIAoften results from a buildup of cholesterol-containing fatty deposits called plaques in an artery. This is known as atherosclerosis. The buildup also may occur in an artery's branches that supply oxygen and nutrients to the brain. Plaques can decrease the blood flow through an artery or lead to the development of a clot. A blood clot that moves from another part of the body, such as the heart, to an artery that supplies the brain also may cause aTIA. Some risk factors of a transient ischemic attack and stroke can't be changed. Others you can control. You can't change these risk factors of aTIAand stroke. But knowing you have these risks can motivate you to change the risk factors you can control. You can control or treat a number of risk factors of aTIAand a stroke, including certain health conditions and lifestyle choices. Having one or more of these risk factors doesn't mean you'll have a stroke, but your risk increases if you have two or more of them. Knowing your risk factors and living healthfully are the best things you can do to prevent a transient ischemic attack. A healthy lifestyle includes getting regular medical checkups. Also: ","A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a short period of symptoms similar to those of a stroke. It's caused by a brief blockage of blood flow to the brain. ATIAusually lasts only a few minutes and doesn't cause long-term damage. However, aTIAmay be a warning. About 1 in 3 people who has aTIAwill eventually have a stroke, with about half occurring within a year after theTIA. Often called a ministroke, aTIAcan serve as both a warning of a future stroke and a chance to prevent it. Transient ischemic attacks usually last a few minutes.

Trigeminal neuralgia,"Trigeminal neuralgia symptoms may include one or more of these patterns: See your healthcare professional if you experience pain in your face, particularly if it's long-lasting or comes back after going away. Also get medical attention if you have chronic pain that doesn't go away with pain medicine that you buy off the shelf. In trigeminal neuralgia, the trigeminal nerve's function is disrupted. Contact between a blood vessel and the trigeminal nerve at the base of the brain often causes the pain. The blood vessel may be an artery or a vein. This contact puts pressure on the nerve and doesn't allow it to function as usual. But while compression by a blood vessel is a common cause, there are many other potential causes. Multiple sclerosis or a similar condition that damages the myelin sheath protecting certain nerves can cause trigeminal neuralgia. A tumor pressing against the trigeminal nerve also can cause the condition. Some people may experience trigeminal neuralgia as a result of a stroke or facial trauma. An injury of the nerve due to surgery also can cause trigeminal neuralgia. Several triggers may set off the pain of trigeminal neuralgia, including: Research has found that some factors put people at higher risk of trigeminal neuralgia, including: ","Trigeminal neuralgia (try-JEM-ih-nul nu-RAL-juh) is a condition that causes intense pain similar to an electric shock on one side of the face. It affects the trigeminal nerve, which carries signals from the face to the brain. Even light touch from brushing your teeth or putting on makeup may trigger a jolt of pain. Trigeminal neuralgia can be long-lasting. It's known as a chronic pain condition. People with trigeminal neuralgia may at first experience short, mild episodes of pain. But the condition can get worse, causing longer periods of pain that happen more often. It's more common in women and people older than 50.

Uterine fibroids,"Many people who have uterine fibroids don't have any symptoms. In those who do, symptoms can be influenced by the location, size and number of fibroids. The most common symptoms of uterine fibroids include: Rarely, a fibroid can cause sudden, serious pain when it outgrows its blood supply and starts to die. Often, fibroids are grouped by their location. Intramural fibroids grow within the muscular wall of the uterus. Submucosal fibroids bulge into the uterine cavity. Subserosal fibroids form on the outside of the uterus. See your doctor if you have: Get medical care right away if you have severe bleeding from the vagina or sharp pelvic pain that comes on fast. The exact cause of uterine fibroids isn't clear. But these factors may play roles: Doctors believe that uterine fibroids may develop from a stem cell in the smooth muscular tissue of the uterus. A single cell divides over and over. In time it turns into a firm, rubbery mass distinct from nearby tissue. The growth patterns of uterine fibroids vary. They may grow slowly or fast. Or they might stay the same size. Some fibroids go through growth spurts, and some shrink on their own. Fibroids that form during pregnancy can shrink or go away after pregnancy, as the uterus goes back to its usual size. There are few known risk factors for uterine fibroids, other than being a person of reproductive age. These include: Uterine fibroids often aren't dangerous. But they can cause pain, and they may lead to complications. These include a drop in red blood cells called anemia. That condition can cause fatigue from heavy blood loss. If you bleed heavily during your period, your doctor may tell you to take an iron supplement to prevent or help manage anemia. Sometimes, a person with anemia needs to receive blood from a donor, called a transfusion, due to blood loss. Often, fibroids don't interfere with getting pregnant. But some fibroids — especially the submucosal kind — could cause infertility or pregnancy loss. Fibroids also may raise the risk of certain pregnancy complications. These include: Researchers continue to study the causes of fibroid tumors. More research is needed on how to prevent them, though. It might not be possible to prevent uterine fibroids. But only a small percentage of these tumors need treatment. You might be able to lower your fibroid risk with healthy lifestyle changes. Try to stay at a healthy weight. Get regular exercise. And eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables. Some research suggests that birth control pills or long-acting progestin-only contraceptives may lower the risk of fibroids. But using birth control pills before the age of 16 may be linked with a higher risk. ","Uterine fibroids are common growths of the uterus. They often appear during the years you're usually able to get pregnant and give birth. Uterine fibroids are not cancer, and they almost never turn into cancer. They aren't linked with a higher risk of other types of cancer in the uterus either. They're also called leiomyomas (lie-o-my-O-muhs) or myomas. Fibroids vary in number and size. You can have a single fibroid or more than one. Some of these growths are too small to see with the eyes. Others can grow to the size of a grapefruit or larger. A fibroid that gets very big can distort the inside and the outside of the uterus. In extreme cases, some fibroids grow large enough to fill the pelvis or stomach area. They can make a person look pregnant. Many people have uterine fibroids sometime during their lives. But you might not know you have them, because they often cause no symptoms. Your health care professional may just happen to find fibroids during a pelvic exam or pregnancy ultrasound. Many people who have uterine fibroids don't have any symptoms.

Ventricular fibrillation,"Collapse and loss of consciousness are the most common symptoms of ventricular fibrillation.
Before a ventricular fibrillation episode, you may have symptoms of an irregularly fast or erratic heartbeat (arrhythmia). You may have:
Make an appointment with a heart doctor (cardiologist) if you have an unexplained fast or pounding heartbeat.
If you see someone collapse, seek emergency medical help immediately. Follow these steps:","Ventricular fibrillation is a type of irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia). During ventricular fibrillation, the lower heart chambers contract in a very rapid and uncoordinated manner. As a result, the heart doesn't pump blood to the rest of the body.
Ventricular fibrillation is an emergency that requires immediate medical attention. It's the most frequent cause of sudden cardiac death.
Emergency treatment for ventricular fibrillation includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and shocks to the heart with a device called an automated external defibrillator (AED). Medications, implanted devices or surgery may be recommended to prevent episodes of ventricular fibrillation.
Ventricular fibrillation may also be called VFib, V-fib or VF."
Vitiligo,"Vitiligo signs include:
Vitiligo can start at any age, but usually appears before age 30.
Depending on the type of vitiligo you have, it may affect:
It's difficult to predict how this disease will progress. Sometimes the patches stop forming without treatment. In most cases, pigment loss spreads and eventually involves most of the skin. Occasionally, the skin gets its color back.
See your health care provider if areas of your skin, hair or mucous membranes lose coloring. Vitiligo has no cure. But treatment might stop or slow the discoloring process and return some color to your skin.","Vitiligo (vit-ih-LIE-go) is a disease that causes loss of skin color in patches. The discolored areas usually get bigger with time. The condition can affect the skin on any part of the body. It can also affect hair and the inside of the mouth.
Normally, the color of hair and skin is determined by melanin. Vitiligo occurs when cells that produce melanin die or stop functioning. Vitiligo affects people of all skin types, but it may be more noticeable in people with brown or Black skin. The condition is not life-threatening or contagious. It can be stressful or make you feel bad about yourself.
Treatment for vitiligo may restore color to the affected skin. But it doesn't prevent continued loss of skin color or a recurrence."
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome,"Symptoms of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may include: See a healthcare professional if you have a burning, aching pain in your upper belly that doesn't go away — especially if you also have nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Tell your care professional if you've been using over-the-counter medicines to reduce stomach acid. These include omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), cimetidine (Tagamet HB) or famotidine (Pepcid AC). These medicines may mask your symptoms, which could delay your diagnosis. The exact cause of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome isn't known. But the pattern of events that occurs in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome typically follows the same sequence. The syndrome begins when one or more tumors form in the pancreas or a part of the small intestine called the duodenum. The duodenum is the section connected to the stomach. Sometimes the tumors form at other sites, such as the lymph nodes next to the pancreas. The pancreas sits behind the stomach. It makes enzymes that are needed for digesting food. The pancreas also makes many hormones, including insulin. Insulin is the hormone that helps control blood sugar, also called glucose. Digestive juices from the pancreas, liver and gallbladder mix in the duodenum. This is where most of digestion happens. The tumors that form with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome are made up of cells that secrete large amounts of the hormone gastrin. For this reason, they are sometimes called gastrinomas. Increased gastrin causes the stomach to make far too much acid. The excess acid then leads to peptic ulcers and sometimes to diarrhea. Besides causing excess acid production, the tumors are often cancerous. Although the tumors tend to grow slowly, the cancer can spread elsewhere — most commonly to nearby lymph nodes or the liver. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may be caused by an inherited condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1). People with MEN 1 also have tumors in the parathyroid glands. They may have tumors in their pituitary glands as well. About 25% of people who have gastrinomas have them as part of MEN 1. They also may have tumors in the pancreas and other organs. If you have a first-degree relative, such as a sibling or parent, with MEN 1, it's more likely that you'll have Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. ","Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is a condition in which one or more tumors grow in the pancreas or small intestine. The tumors, called gastrinomas, produce large amounts of the hormone gastrin. Gastrin causes the stomach to produce too much acid, which leads to peptic ulcers. High gastrin levels also can cause diarrhea, belly pain and other symptoms. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is rare. Though it may happen at any time in life, people usually find out they have it sometime between ages 20 and 50. Medicines to cut down stomach acid and heal the ulcers are the usual treatment. Some people also may need surgery to remove tumors. Symptoms of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may include: See a healthcare professional if you have a burning, aching pain in your upper belly that doesn't go away — especially if you also have nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Tell your care professional if you've been using over-the-counter medicines to reduce stomach acid. These include omeprazole (Prilosec, Zegerid), cimetidine (Tagamet HB) or famotidine (Pepcid AC). These medicines may mask your symptoms, which could delay your diagnosis. The exact cause of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome isn't known. But the pattern of events that occurs in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome typically follows the same sequence. The syndrome begins when one or more tumors form in the pancreas or a part of the small intestine called the duodenum. The duodenum is the section connected to the stomach. Sometimes the tumors form at other sites, such as the lymph nodes next to the pancreas. The pancreas sits behind the stomach. It makes enzymes that are needed for digesting food. The pancreas also makes many hormones, including insulin. Insulin is the hormone that helps control blood sugar, also called glucose. Digestive juices from the pancreas, liver and gallbladder mix in the duodenum. This is where most of digestion happens. The tumors that form with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome are made up of cells that secrete large amounts of the hormone gastrin. For this reason, they are sometimes called gastrinomas. Increased gastrin causes the stomach to make far too much acid. The excess acid then leads to peptic ulcers and sometimes to diarrhea. Besides causing excess acid production, the tumors are often cancerous. Although the tumors tend to grow slowly, the cancer can spread elsewhere — most commonly to nearby lymph nodes or the liver. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome may be caused by an inherited condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1). People with MEN 1 also have tumors in the parathyroid glands. They may have tumors in their pituitary glands as well. About 25% of people who have gastrinomas have them as part of MEN 1. They also may have tumors in the pancreas and other organs. If you have a first-degree relative, such as a sibling or parent, with MEN 1, it's more likely that you'll have Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. "
